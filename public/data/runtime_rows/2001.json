In this paper, we theorize about how suppliers of electronic information compete for this resource and use data on document database use in a management consulting company to show that document suppliers that occupied a crowded segment of the firm's internal knowledge market gained less attention from employees (measured as monthly use of their database) but were able to combat this negative competitive effect by being selective and concentrated in their document supply. This result reveals a paradox of information supply in competitive information markets: the less information a supplier offered, the more it was used, because the supplier developed a reputation for quality and focus.

We develop theory to explain variation in the responses of firms to such pressures, i.e., why some firms acquiesce by actually implementing stock repurchase programs, while others decouple formally adopted repurchase programs from actual corporate investments, so that the plans remain more symbolic than substantive. Results of a longitudinal study of stock repurchase programs over a six-year time period show that decoupling is more likely to occur when top executives have power over boards to avoid institutional pressures for change and when social structural or experiential factors enhance awareness among powerful actors of the potential for organizational decoupling.

From qualitative research in three culturally diverse organizations, we identified three different perspectives on workforce diversity: the integration-and-learning perspective, the access-and-legitimacy perspective, and the discrimination-and-fairness perspective. The perspective on diversity a work group held influenced how people expressed and managed tensions related to diversity, whether those who had been traditionally underrepresented in the organization felt respected and valued by their colleagues, and how people interpreted the meaning of their racial identity at work. These, in turn, had implications for how well the work group and its members functioned. All three perspectives on diversity had been successful in motivating managers to diversify their staffs, but only the integration-and-learning perspective provided the rationale and guidance needed to achieve sustained benefits from diversity. By identifying the conditions that intervene between the demographic composition of a work group and its functioning, our research helps to explain mixed results on the relationship between cultural diversity and work group outcomes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2667087","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['cultural diversity', 'workforce diversity', 'discrimination-and-fairness', 'integration-and-learning', 'racial identity']","The article emphasizes cultural diversity and its impact on work group dynamics, highlighting perspectives that address discrimination and fairness, which are central to DEI themes.

We tested our hypotheses in a sample of MBA candidates and a sample of financial services firm officers and found that people who were more demographically different from their coworkers engendered more negative impressions than did more similar coworkers. These impressions were more positive, however, when demographically different people were either more extraverted or higher self-monitors. Further, impressions formed of others mediated the influence of demographic differences on an individual's performance such that the negative effect of being demographically different disappeared when the relationship between impression formation and performance was considered.

Analysts that initiate coverage of a firm in the wake of a cascade are particularly prone to overestimating the firm's future profitability, however, and they are subsequently more likely than other analysts to abandon coverage of the firm.

We show that multitechnology firms need to have knowledge in excess of what they need for what they make, to cope with imbalances caused by uneven rates of development in the technologies on which they rely and with unpredictable product-level interdependences. By knowing more, multitechnology firms can coordinate loosely coupled networks of suppliers of equipment, components, and specialized knowledge and maintain a capability for systems integration.

Longitudinal analyses of archival data for a large sample of Forbes/Fortune 500 companies, as well as analyses of survey data on mimetic processes among these firms, show that network ties to firms that use imitation to determine a particular policy can prompt use of imitation by the focal firm in determining both that policy and a different policy.

Technical Committee Activity and Alliance Formation","We examine how interaction between mid-level managers in technical committees facilitates subsequent alliance formation in a longitudinal study of 87 cellular service providers and equipment manufacturers. Joint participation by firms in technical committees helps them identify potential alliance partners and particular opportunities for technical collaboration. This effect is magnified by sustained participation by individuals on behalf of their firms, demonstrating that interfirm relationships are enhanced by the interpersonal bonds that are forged in technical committees. In contrast, we find that the effect of joint technical committee participation on alliance formation decreases as firms have more prior alliances, suggesting that technical committees provide a more critical avenue for knowledge exchange when firms do not have the luxury of exchanging information through contractual linkages. Taken together, these findings suggest one venue where managerial action can transform existing social structure, because technical committee activity facilitates the entry of less-established firms into alliance networks.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3094830","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","4","['social structure', 'managerial action', 'less-established firms']","The article discusses how technical committee activity can enhance the entry of less-established firms into alliance networks, hinting at themes of inclusivity and social structure transformation.

This study builds on a prior study that examined changes in the market value of the firm as reflected by the stock price in response to IT investment announcements. Data on stock prices were analyzed for 238 publicly traded companies. In addition to the stock price analysis, reaction of trading volume to the announcements was also examined to identify whether IT investment announcements affect investors' beliefs about IT value. Potentially confounding factors such as industry, size, and time lag effects were also analyzed. Size and time lag effects were found for all IT investment announcements. Reactions of price and volume were negatively related to firm size and became more positive over time. The positive excess return for smaller firms shows that smaller firms can leverage the lower price/performance ratio of new IT and reap greater rewards from IT investments than larger firms. Also, the result of time lag effect demonstrates that the stock market has recently begun to identify both tangible and intangible benefits of IT investments. For recent IT investment announcements, industry classification and firm size also affected the reactions of stock price to the announcements. This study provides optimism on the stock market reaction to IT investment announcements as well as further insight into the study of IT impacts on organizational performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.1.103.9718","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of IT investments and their impact on market value, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Decision strategies for real-time dynamic tasks consist of two main overlapping cognitive activities: monitoring and control. Monitoring refers to decision makers' tracking of key system variables as they work toward arriving at a decision. Control refers to the decision maker's generation, evaluation, and selection of alternative actions. In real-time tasks, these two activities compete for the same attentional resources. The questions that motivate the two studies presented here are: (1) can decision making be improved by increasing individuals' attentional resources, thereby enhancing their ability to monitor the system, and (2) can decision making be improved by providing individuals with feedback and/or feedforward control support? Our findings show that some kinds of cognitive support degrade performance, rather than enhance it. These results indicate that providing support for real-time dynamic decision making may be very difficult, and that designing effective decision aids requires a detailed understanding of the underlying cognitive processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.1.63.9717","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processes and decision-making strategies in a technical context without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet, drawing on a review of the full set of articles published in Information Systems Research (ISR) over the past ten years, we argue that the field has not deeply engaged its core subject matter\u2014the information technology (IT) artifact. Instead, we find that IS researchers tend to give central theoretical significance to the context (within which some usually unspecified technology is seen to operate), the discrete processing capabilities of the artifact (as separable from its context or use), or the dependent variable (that which is posited to be affected or changed as technology is developed, implemented, and used). The IT artifact itself tends to disappear from view, be taken for granted, or is presumed to be unproblematic once it is built and installed. After discussing the implications of our findings, we propose a research direction for the IS field that begins to take technology as seriously as its effects, context, and capabilities. In particular, we propose that IS researchers begin to theorize specifically about IT artifacts, and then incorporate these theories explicitly into their studies. We believe that such a research direction is critical if IS research is to make a significant contribution to the understanding of a world increasingly suffused with ubiquitous, interdependent, and emergent information technologies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.2.121.9700","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['socio-economic', 'theorizing', 'technology', 'context', 'implications']","The article discusses the socio-economic implications of information technology and emphasizes the need for a deeper theoretical engagement with IT artifacts, which reflects a moderate focus on ethical considerations and the societal impact of technology.

However, empirical support for the benefits to firms from e-commerce is weaker than glowing accounts in the popular press, based on anecdotal evidence, would lead us to believe. In this paper, we explore the following questions: What are the returns to shareholders in firms engaging in e-commerce? How do the returns to conventional, brick and mortar firms from e-commerce initiatives compare with returns to the new breed of net firms? How do returns from business-to-business e-commerce compare with returns from business-to-consumer e-commerce? How do the returns to e-commerce initiatives involving digital goods compare to initiatives involving tangible goods? We examine these issues using event study methodology and assess the cumulative abnormal returns to shareholders (CARs) for 251 e-commerce initiatives announced by firms between October and December 1998. The results suggest that e-commerce initiatives do indeed lead to significant positive CARs for firms' shareholders. While the CARs for conventional firms are not significantly different from those for net firms, the CARs for business-to-consumer (B2C) announcements are higher than those for business-to-business (B2B) announcements. Also, the CARs with respect to e-commerce initiatives involving tangible goods are higher than for those involving digital goods. Our data were collected in the last quarter of 1998 during a unique bull market period and the magnitudes of CARs (between 4.9 and 23.4% for different subsamples) in response to e-commerce announcements are larger than those reported for a variety of other firm actions in prior event studies.

This research investigated three variables believed to impact outcomes in telecommuting: the availability of information system technology, the availability of communication technologies, and the communication patterns of telecommuters within their work groups. Two perspectives are used in this study. The direct effects of these three variables on perceived productivity, performance, and satisfaction were tested. A second perspective, based on the concept of fit and contingency theory, posits that successful telecommuting outcomes, measured by perceived productivity, performance, and satisfaction, are predicted by interactions between these independent variables. The study was conducted by surveying multiple respondents from different organizations who were members of work groups in which some or all employees were telecommuters. The results indicate that technology variables positively impact productivity, performance, and satisfaction of telecommuters, while the interaction between the technology variables is significant in predicting perceived productivity. Work group communication, as measured by the centrality of individuals, negatively affects perceived productivity and performance.

The main function of SOM networks is to map the input data from an n-dimensional space to a lower dimensional (usually one- or two-dimensional) plot while maintaining the original topological relations. Therefore, it can be viewed as an analog of factor analysis. In this research, we evaluate the feasibility of using SOM networks as a robust alternative to factor analysis and clustering for data mining applications. Specifically, we compare SOM network solutions to factor analytic and K-Means clustering solutions on simulated data sets with known underlying factor and cluster structures. The comparisons indicate that the SOM networks provide solutions superior to unrotated factor solutions in general and provide more accurate recovery of underlying cluster structures when the input data are skewed.

This paper derives a formal relationship between deadline-setting policies and software product quality. It shows that: (1) adding slack does not always preserve quality, thus, systematically adding slack is an incomplete policy for minimizing costs; (2) costs can be minimized by adopting policies that permit estimates of completion dates and deadlines that are different and; (3) contrary to casual intuition, shortcut-taking can be eliminated by setting deadlines aggressively, thereby maintaining or even increasing the time pressures under which developers work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.2.195.9699","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development and management practices without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, despite strong growth in demand, providers continue to have difficulty achieving profitability, customer churn remains high, and network performance continues to draw complaints. We suggest that strategic business planning for network services would benefit from a systems thinking approach that analyzes the feedback effects present in the underlying business process. These feedback loops can be complex and have significant impact on business performance. For instance, while the size of a provider's customer base depends on price and network performance, network performance is itself dependent on the size of the customer base. In this paper, we develop a planning model that represents these feedback effects using the finite difference equations methodology of systems dynamics. The model is validated by showing its fit with essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain, and by showing its ability to replicate observed reference mode behaviors. Simulations are then carried out under a variety of scenarios to examine issues important to service providers. Among other findings, the simulations suggest that (a) under flat-rate pricing, lowering price to increase customer base can hurt profitability as well as network performance; (b) under usage-based pricing, lowering price need not necessarily lead to a larger customer base; and (c) in addition to price, the customers' threshold of tolerance for performance degradation plays a significant role in balancing market share with profitability. We briefly present a prototype decision support system based on the systems thinking approach, and suggest ways in which it could be used to help business planning for network services.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.3.260.9713","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of business planning and profitability in network services without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To construct the model, we identified and organized the factors that were found to be influential in prior EDI research. By testing all these factors together in one model, we are able to investigate their relative contributions to EDI adoption decisions. Senior purchasing managers, chosen for their experience with EDI and proximity to the EDI adoption decision, were surveyed and their responses analyzed using structural equation modeling. All three determinants were found to be significant predictors of intent to adopt EDI, with external pressure and readiness being considerably more important than perceived benefits. We show that the constructs in this model can be categorized into three levels: technological, organizational, and interorganizational. We hypothesize that these categories of influence will also be determinants of the adoption of other emerging forms of interorganizational systems (IOS).1","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.3.304.9708","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['external pressure', 'adoption', 'interorganizational']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of electronic data interchange (EDI) adoption without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

It has been proposed that these structures are new forms of organizing which are not subject to the same constraints as traditional social structures. However, from anecdotal evidence and case studies it is difficult to evaluate whether online social structures are subject to the same problems as traditional social structures. Drawing from prior studies of traditional social structures and empirical analyses of longitudinal data from a sample of Internet-based groups, this exploratory work considers the role of size and communication activity in sustainable online social structures. A resource-based theory of sustainable social structures is presented. Members contribute time, energy, and other resources, enabling a social structure to provide benefits for individuals. These benefits, which include information, influence, and social support, are the basis for a social structure's ability to attract and retain members. This model focuses on the system of opposing forces that link membership size as a component of resource availability and communication activity as an aspect of benefit provision to the sustainability of an online social structure. Analyses of data from a random sample of e-mail-based Internet social structures (listservs) indicate that communication activity and size have both positive and negative effects on a structure's sustainability. These results suggest that while the use of networked communication technologies may alter the form of communication, balancing the opposing impacts of membership size and communication activity in order to maintain resource availability and provide benefits for current members remains a fundamental problem underlying the development of sustainable online social structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.4.346.9703","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['sustainability', 'social structures', 'communication']","The article discusses sustainability and the dynamics of online social structures, which hints at social responsibility.

We model collaborative decision making as an argumentation process. We develop a connectionist modeling framework, a network representation formalism for argument structures, connectionist network mechanisms, and their models of computations to extract the behavior of argument structures. We use two examples from the case study literature to illustrate the concepts. Several interesting properties of the connectionist network models are observed from our computational results. We find that although the length of the computation is affected by parametric values, the final activation levels of the units are largely unaffected. We observe that the initial activation levels of the defeasible units seem to have no effect on their final activation levels. The proposed modeling approach generates valuable insights into the characteristics of specific argumentative discussions. While the intention of this work is not to introduce the connectionist paradigm as a means to bring arguments to a closure (resolution), we show that certain resolution mechanisms can be easily implemented under the connectionist framework.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.4.363.9705","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['collaborative decision making', 'argumentation', 'network representation']","The article focuses on a technical framework for collaborative decision making without emphasizing social justice or ethical critiques.

A Theory and Three Empirical Tests","An important feature of some conceptual modelling grammars is the features they provide to allow database designers to show real-world things may or may not possess a particular attribute or relationship. In the entity-relationship model, for example, the fact that a thing may not possess an attribute can be represented by using a special symbol to indicate that the attribute is optional. Similarly, the fact that a thing may or may not be involved in a relationship can be represented by showing the minimum cardinality of the relationship as zero. Whether these practices should be followed, however, is a contentious issue. An alternative approach is to eliminate optional attributes and relationships from conceptual schema diagrams by using subtypes that have only mandatory attributes and relationships. In this paper, we first present a theory that led us to predict that optional attributes and relationships should be used in conceptual schema diagrams only when users of the diagrams require a surface-level understanding of the domain being represented by the diagrams. When users require a deep-level understanding, however, optional attributes and relationships should not be used because they undermine users' abilities to grasp important domain semantics. We describe three experiments which we then undertook to test our predictions. The results of the experiments support our predictions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.12.4.384.9702","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of conceptual modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because intangible assets typically are unrecognized and estimates of their fair values are not disclosed, absent analyst coverage firms with more intangible assets likely have less informative prices. Accordingly, we expect analysts have greater incentives to cover firms with more intangible assets and, thus, predict they have higher analyst coverage. As predicted, we find that analyst coverage is significantly greater for firms with larger research and development and advertising expenses relative to their industry, and for firms in industries with larger research and development expense. We also predict and find that analyst coverage is increasing in firm size, growth, trading volume, equity issuance, and perceived mispricing, and is decreasing in the size of the firm's analysts' brokerage houses and the effort analysts expend to follow the firm. These findings indicate that analyst coverage depends on private benefits and costs of covering a firm. We also test hypotheses related to analyst effort. We predict and find that analysts expend greater effort to follow firms with more intangible assets, after controlling for other factors associated with analyst effort. Our evidence indicates that intangible assets, most of which are not recognized in firms' financial statements, are associated with greater incentives for analysts to cover such firms, and greater costs of coverage. An open question is whether financial statement recognition of intangible assets could more efficiently provide information about such assets to investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00001","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the relationship between analyst coverage and intangible assets, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Auditors' reporting is compared across the following four regimes: one that does not require either rotation or retention, a second that requires retention only, a third that requires rotation only, and a fourth that requires both rotation and retention. We find that the rotation requirements in the third and fourth regimes decreased auditor-subjects' willingness to issue biased reports, relative to the two regimes in which rotation was not imposed. In these other two regimes, however, many manager-subjects voluntarily retained the same auditor-subjects over multi-periods. While the long running interactions between manager- and auditor-subjects resulted in more favorable reports by auditor-subjects (a lower level of independence), the established relationships also induced manager-subjects to make higher investments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00005","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['independence', 'biased reports', 'auditors']","The article discusses auditor independence and bias in reporting, which touches on ethical considerations in accounting practices.

Specifically, we use a discounted residual income model to generate a market implied cost-of-capital. We then examine firm characteristics that are systematically related to this estimate of cost-of-capital. We show that a firm's implied cost-of-capital is a function of its industry membership, B/M ratio, forecasted long-term growth rate, and the dispersion in analyst earnings forecasts. Together, these variables explain around 60% of the cross-sectional variation in future (two-year-ahead) implied costs-of-capital. The stability of these long-term relations suggests they can be exploited to estimate future costs-of-capital.

It contributes to prior research by distinguishing between two distinct aspects of changing prices:(1) the change in the general price level, and (2) the change in the value of specific non-monetary assets. I select Mexico to examine because it is unique in requiring and disclosing separately price level and replacement cost adjustments. A sample of Mexican firms also addresses a key reason cited for mixed results in previous assessments of the usefulness of price level and replacement cost accounting using United States data: the effects of inflation are too weak to detect. High rates of inflation in Mexico, ranging between 7% and 52% during the sample period, mitigate that potential problem. Results indicate that replacement cost adjustments are relatively and incrementally relevant beyond historical cost and price level measures while price level adjustments are incrementally value relevant beyond historical measures.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00008","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to price changes and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We extend Beaver and Ryan (1996, 2000) by decomposing book-to-market into a more persistent (bias) component and a delayed recognition (lag) component. We find that both components are related to analyst expectations of future earnings, but the lag component is the dominant factor across all forecast horizons. Similarly, we find that the lag component explains most of the inverse relation between book-to-market and future returns. Given that lag is constructed by regressing book-to-market ratios on lagged price changes, our results are consistent with the lag component capturing systematic stock price reversals. We find that the components have unique relations with subsequent earnings forecast revisions, and controlling for these relations substantially mitigates the components\u2019 ability to predict returns. Our component-level analysis provides insight into how expected future earnings, summarized in book-to-market ratios help to explain this market anomaly.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00009","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

I show that a rightward temporal shift in median surprise from negative to positive describes earnings, but neither profits nor losses. Median profit surprise shifts within the positive quadrant, from zero to one cent per share. Median loss surprise shifts within the negative quadrant from extreme negative (about -33 cents per share) to zero. I show that the median surprise for profits exceeds that for losses in every year. I document significant positive temporal trends in both meet and beat analyst estimates for both profits and losses, but I find a greater frequency of profits that either meet or beat analyst estimates in every year. I find a significant positive temporal trend in positive profits that are \u201ca little bit of good news,\u201d and a significant negative temporal trend in managers who report losses that are an \u201cextreme amount of bad news.\u201d My results are robust to the four internal validity threats I consider\u2014namely temporal changes in: (1) analyst forecast accuracy, (2) the mix of earnings of one sign preceded by earnings of another sign four quarters ago, (3) the timeliness of the most recent analyst forecast, and (4) the I/B/E/S definition of actual earnings.

We conduct a laboratory market experiment to assess the effects of such disclosures on capital allocation decisions. We develop two sets of competing hypotheses regarding how capital markets react to supplemental disclosures. One set is based on the assumption of semi-strong market efficiency, while the other posits that the bounded rationality of individual traders leads to inefficient market prices. We find that explicit disclosure of management\u2019s best estimate of an uncertain quantity improves market efficiency, even though this disclosure is redundant with information in financial statements. Second, we find disclosure of an upper bound of management\u2019s estimate has the potential to bias security prices upward, while informationally equivalent disclosure of both upper and lower bounds removes this bias. These results suggest that experimental market reactions to these supplemental disclosures are inconsistent with market efficiency. Supplemental analyses of individuals\u2019 price predictions and trading behavior support our conclusion that inefficiencies are at least partially attributable to individual information processing biases.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00011","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['disclosure', 'transparency', 'efficiency']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of financial reporting and market efficiency, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We extend previous work by Petroni and Beasley (1996) by expanding the set of external monitors to include both auditors and actuaries. We investigate whether certain auditor-actuary pairs are associated with less understatement of the loss reserve account by financially struggling insurers. Our data consist of loss adjustments reported by 465 property-casualty insurers for reserves established in 1993. The results indicate that under-reserving by weak insurers is essentially eliminated when the firm uses auditors and actuaries that are both from Big Six accounting firms. In contrast, non-Big Six actuaries have less impact on under-reserving by weak insurers. Our results suggest that the quality usually associated with Big Six auditors falls when the audit firm relies on third party actuaries to evaluate the loss reserve estimates of struggling insurance clients. We conjecture that Big Six actuaries insist on more conservative loss reserve levels because, compared to actuarial consulting firms, they are more attuned to the liability exposure of the auditor.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00012","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and external monitoring without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

While the manager is prohibited from directly disclosing her private information, she is allowed to bias reported earnings in the first period, subject to GAAP rules that require that a specified proportion of the bias be reversed subsequently. We show there is a minimum threshold of reversal, such that, when the proportion of required reversal is above this threshold, the manager smooths income and communicates her private information through reported earnings. Consequently, the market attaches greater weight to reported earnings than under a regime that allows no discretion. When the required reversal is below the minimum threshold, the manager increases reported earnings without limit and the equilibrium degenerates. When the manager is not endowed with any private information, the market unravels the \u201ctrue\u201d earnings and price is unaffected by earnings management.

We find that the choice of PS is influenced by tax and regulatory changes imposed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) and the 1989 Basle Banking Accord as well as various firm specific incentives. We find that industrials issue PS to preserve tax attributes by avoiding an ownership change and to maximize foreign tax credit utilization. In addition, we find that the regulatory requirements of the Basle Accord influence the choice by banks to issue PS. Finally, we show that although firms could have issued alternative securities that would have allowed them to achieve the same tax or regulatory goals, firm specific factors limit their ability to do so. For example, firms can also avoid triggering an ownership change by issuing straight debt, however, financial distress considerations may constrain their ability to issue additional debt. Therefore, we demonstrate that the final choice of PS is influenced by a combination of tax, regulatory, and firm specific incentives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00023","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial instruments and regulatory influences without addressing social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Further, we study whether investor valuations differ across jurisdictions. Finally, we examine the relation between investor valuation of stranded costs and the decision by utilities to make stranded cost-related disclosures in their financial statements voluntarily.\n         We find that investors anticipate that, on average, approximately 10% of total stranded costs will be borne by utility shareholders. Stranded costs arising from voluntary operating or investing decisions made by utilities are valued more negatively than those associated with mandatory power purchase contracts, consistent with investors assigning a higher recovery probability to the latter. Investor valuations of stranded costs associated with utility generating investments do not differ systematically across jurisdictions. We find that stranded costs are valued less negatively for voluntary disclosers not just in the year of disclosure but also in the preceding two years, implying that it is not disclosure per se that favorably influences valuation. Voluntary disclosers operate in jurisdictions that have more clearly established stranded cost recovery mechanisms, suggesting that both stranded cost disclosure and valuation are prompted by reduction in uncertainty about recoverability.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00025","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to stranded costs and investor valuations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Each auditor predicts the choices that will be made by other auditors on two tasks that differ in their level of ambiguity. Our results show no difference in the accuracy among managers, top seniors, and mediocre seniors when they predict the choices made by specific individual auditors for both tasks.

We propose that explaining (or providing reasons for) decisions shifts the focus from the choice of options to the choice of reasons. Furthermore, buyers who explain their decisions and have high NFU tend to select unconventional reasons and are, consequently, more likely to make unconventional choices. These predictions were supported in a series of studies involving choices between conventional and less-conventional options, such as whether to switch to a brand on sale, whether to select a compromise option, and whether to accept a gamble with a possible loss. The findings also indicate that the effects of providing reasons are not due to attempts to act rationally or to concerns about being evaluated. Three boundary conditions on the generalization that high NFU consumers who provide reasons tend to make unconventional choices were examined, all involving forces that promote conformity over uniqueness. They include evaluation by others, explicit information about the preferences of others, and negative feedback on previous decision performance. We discuss the implications of this research with respect to the roles of explanations, NFU, and accountability in buyer decision making.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/1/49/1791551","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['uniqueness', 'consumer decision making', 'unconventional choices']","The article focuses on consumer decision-making and the need for uniqueness, which touches on individual differences in behavior but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We propose that persuasion knowledge is used when consumers draw an inference that a persuasion motive may underlie a salesperson's behavior. These motive inferences then affect perceptions of the salesperson. We propose that two factors, the accessibility of persuasion motives and the cognitive capacity of the consumer, affect whether consumers use persuasion knowledge. When an ulterior persuasion motive is highly accessible, both cognitively busy targets and unbusy observers use persuasion knowledge to evaluate the salesperson. When an ulterior motive is less accessible, cognitively busy targets are less likely to use persuasion knowledge, evaluating the salesperson as more sincere than are cognitively unbusy observers.

Under such conditions, relevant evidence about the country of origin provided by dispersed information is likely to affect country-of-origin evaluations. In contrast, if consumers do not focus on the country of origin, such as under high motivation, or if their processing goal directs their attention away from country-of-origin information, any evidence about the country of origin is less likely to be utilized in their judgments.

Specifically, we propose that cultures endow individuals with different rules or principles that provide guidance for making decisions, and a need to provide reasons activates such cultural knowledge. This proposition, representing a dynamic rather than dispositional view of cultural influence, is investigated in studies of consumer decisions that involve a trade-off between diverging attributes, such as low price and high quality. Principles enjoining compromise are more salient in East Asian cultures than in North American culture, and accordingly, we predict that cultural differences in the tendency to choose compromise options will be greater when the decision task requires that participants provide reasons. In study 1, a difference between Hong Kong Chinese and North American participants in the tendency to select compromise products emerged only when they were asked to explain their decisions, with Hong Kong decision makers more likely and Americans less likely to compromise. Content analysis of participants' reasons confirmed that cultural differences in the frequency of generating particular types of reasons mediated the difference in choices. Studies 2 and 3 replicate the interactive effect of culture and the need to provide reasons in a comparison of North American versus Japanese participants and in a comparison of European-American and Asian-American participants, respectively. Studies 4 and 5 found that Hong Kong Chinese participants, compared with Americans, evaluate proverbs and the reasons of others more positively when these favor compromise.

Cherished possessions and their disposition play a significant role in older consumers' reminiscence and life review. Concerns about disposition of special possessions involve strong and ambivalent emotions. Older consumers voice concern over avoiding intrafamilial conflict, reducing uncertainty, and exercising control over the future life of special possessions. We emphasize the storied nature of the meanings consumers attach to their cherished possessions and the way in which these storied meanings are bundled with life review and disposition concerns. Many older consumers attempt to control meanings transferred with cherished possessions. They seek to pass on personal and familial legacies, achieve symbolic immortality, insure a good home for special objects, and/or influence the future lives of others. We show that there is a porous boundary between ownership and disposition of cherished possessions. And to our knowledge this is the first research to identify tactics and heuristics employed to select recipients for special possessions, time transfers, and effect these transfers. We suggest that future research could explore individual differences in disposition behaviors, the use of possessions by older consumers as external mnemonic props, disposition decision theory, cultural differences in disposition behaviors, or the role of special possessions in the creation of familial legacies.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/2/179/1786004","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['emotions', 'familial legacies', 'ownership']","The article touches on themes of familial legacies and the emotional aspects of ownership, which hint at broader societal concerns, but it primarily focuses on consumer behavior without a strong emphasis on social justice or equity.

In a series of three studies, we show that preferences, both expressed and revealed, change depending on the degree to which anticipated satisfaction is evoked. These shifts in preferences arise because, compared to choice, anticipated satisfaction elicits a mental-imaging processing strategy that is both more effort intensive and qualitatively different. By providing direct evidence from thought protocols and by presenting evidence suggesting that these shifts in preferences vanish when mental imagery is discouraged or made more difficult, we show that the effect arises out of a processing strategy that requires effortful mental imagery of one or more of the options in the decision-making task. Finally, we demonstrate the uniqueness of the effect by showing that it cannot be generated with heightened processing or by an orientation that is directed toward the extent to which the options are liked.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/2/202/1786010","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice and satisfaction without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Only two of these modes (biased assimilation and relative weighting) were found to be sensitive to the refutability of the persuasive communication; the effectiveness of the remaining one (minimization of impact) was not influenced by this factor. Specifically, committed individuals demonstrated biased assimilation in the face of easy to refute negative information, but this mode of resistance decreased in its effectiveness when the information became difficult to refute. The relative-weighting mode of resistance (decreasing the weight given to attributes influenced by the negative information and increasing the weight given to favorably evaluated attributes), in contrast, emerged only in the face of difficult to refute information, apparently when biased assimilation decreased in its effectiveness. The impact mode of resistance was fairly effective in the face of both easy and difficult to refute information. That is, committed respondents attempted to isolate the impact of the negative information to the target attribute, minimizing its spillover to the other attributes in the attitudinal representation in response to both easy and difficult to refute messages.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/2/217/1786019","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on psychological processes related to persuasion without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In doing so, marketers have to select the type of information system they want to utilize in order to deliver the most appropriate information to their consumers. One of the most interesting and distinguishing dimensions of such information systems is the level of control the consumer has over the information system. The current work presents and tests a general model for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of information control on consumers' decision quality, memory, knowledge, and confidence. The results show that controlling the information flow can help consumers better match their preferences, have better memory and knowledge about the domain they are examining, and be more confident in their judgments. However, it is also shown that controlling the information flow creates demands on processing resources and therefore under some circumstances can have detrimental effects on consumers' ability to utilize information.

Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts in a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the degree of personal commitment to the out-of-stock alternative. The results show that personal commitment to an out-of-stock choice option is a function of preference for the option, whether the option is included in the consumer's consideration set, and the degree to which the stockout announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment to the out-of-stock option increases, consumers react substantially and negatively to the stockout\u2014they report lower satisfaction with the decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal commitment to the out-of-stock option is low and the stockout leads to a decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer response to the stockout can actually be positive.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/2/249/1786037","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior in response to stockouts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this article we examine the impact of this dynamic decision process on individuals' choices and satisfaction with their outcomes. We propose that choices reflect a balancing of two classes of goals: goals that are strictly individual and goals that are triggered by the existence of the group. The latter sometimes results in choices that undermine personal satisfaction and increase regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in which we tracked consumers' orders of dishes and drinks. In the Lunch study we found that real groups (tables) choose more varied dishes than would be expected by random sampling of the population of all individual choices across all tables. The Beer study demonstrates that this group-level variety seeking is attributable to the interaction\u2014implicit or explicit\u2014among group members, and can be dissipated when the group is forced to \u201cdisband\u201d and its members make strictly individual choices.

Such asymmetric price competition can be explained with numerous mechanisms proposed here and elsewhere. We report a choice experiment that replicates asymmetric price competition favoring higher-quality competitors and demonstrates asymmetric quality competition favoring lower-quality competitors. Also demonstrated are multiple mechanisms contributing to competitive asymmetries, where dominance involving the otherwise preferred brand is particularly potent (e.g., when a higher-quality competitor matches the price of an otherwise preferred lower-quality brand). The findings implicate modifications to (1) theories of decision making when extended to repeat choice, (2) empirical models of secondary purchase data, and (3) strategies for positioning and attacking brands.

To shed more light on how much effort it would take consumers to choose from a memory-set and how difficult it would be for a product to enter or remain in that set, this research examines the composition of memory-sets in terms of their descriptive characteristics: stability, or how consistent the set is across similar situations; size, or how large the set is; variety, or how distinct the products within the set are; and preference dispersion, or how equal the preferences are toward the set products. To pinpoint the specific elements of usage situations that influence these properties and to address the limitation of inconsistent operationalizations of usage situations both within and across prior studies, this research operationalized usage situations in terms of two key elements: usage occasion and usage location. Results of two studies using 32 situations that varied on occasion and location familiarities in two replicate product classes revealed that memory-sets of more familiar occasions had lower stability, larger size, and marginally greater variety. Similarly, sets of more familiar locations portrayed lower stability than those of less familiar locations, as well as set variety equal to those of less familiar locations. Finally, the underlying explanation of the above results, the process of forming memory-sets\u2014direct retrieval of items from memory in more familiar situations and use of situation goals in less familiar situations\u2014was also confirmed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/3/309/1796830","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and memory-based consideration sets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These tests are typically conducted on data from \u201cbetween-subjects\u201d experiments in which participants were randomly assigned to conditions. We show that, despite using internally valid experimental designs such as this, aggregation biases can arise in which the theoretically critical pattern holds in the aggregate even though it holds for no (or few) individuals. First, we show that crossover interactions\u2014often taken as strong evidence of moderating variables\u2014can arise from the aggregation of two or more segments that do not exhibit such interactions when considered separately. Second, we show that certain context effects that have been reported for choice problems can result from the aggregation of two (or more) segments that do not exhibit these effects when considered separately. Given these threats to the conclusions drawn from experimental results, we describe the conditions under which unobserved heterogeneity can be ruled out as an alternative explanation based on one or more of the following: a priori considerations, derived properties, diagnostic statistics, and the results of latent class modeling. When these tests cannot rule out explanations based on unobserved heterogeneity, this is a serious problem for theorists who assume implicitly that the same theoretical principle works equally for everyone, but for random error. The empirical data patterns revealed by our diagnostics can expose the weakness in the theory but not fix it.

Buyers and sellers differ not simply in their valuation of the same item but also in how they assess the value. Buyers tend to focus on their sentiment toward what they forgo (typically, the expenditure), and buying prices are thus heavily influenced by variables such as salient reference prices. By the same token, sellers tend to focus on their sentiment toward surrendering the item, and selling prices are hence more heavily influenced by variables such as benefits of possessing the item. Four studies examining buying- and selling-price estimates of tickets for National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball games offer consistent support for these ideas. The studies show that naturally occurring differences among respondents in attitudes relating to the tickets that sellers forgo (e.g., significance of the game) corresponded more closely to variation in selling prices than in buying prices. Conversely, measures relating to the expenditure (e.g., respondents' concern with money) corresponded more closely to buying prices than to selling prices. Using controlled manipulations we then showed that changes in aspects relating to the game (e.g., expected climate in the stadium) affected selling prices more than buying prices, but changes relating to the expenditure (e.g., list price of the ticket) influenced buying prices more than selling prices. We also showed that drawing attention to the benefits of possessing a ticket before asking for the price estimates influenced buying prices more than selling prices, supporting our claim that otherwise these benefits are naturally more salient to sellers than buyers. Similarly, drawing attention to alternative uses of money before asking for price estimates influenced selling prices more than buying prices.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/3/360/1796841","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic valuation differences between buyers and sellers without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

As a normative decision maker, s/he considers the purchase price of the new alternative, but s/he additionally considers the mental cost of retiring the old product before s/he has gotten his/her money's worth out of it. During ownership of a product, a consumer mentally depreciates the initial purchase price, thus creating a \u201cmental book value\u201d for the product. The write-off of this mental book value is felt as the mental cost of a replacement purchase. Based on the principles of mental accounting and mental depreciation, I provide a theoretical explanation for this mental cost and why an individual's replacement purchase decision may be more sensitive to the mental cost than the marginal cost. When applied appropriately, mental accounting can serve a useful purpose to the utility-maximizing consumer in the long run, but when misapplied, it results in a misallocation of resources that does not add any value from the perspective of utility maximization. Through three experiments, I measure the negative effect of the write-off on a replacement purchase decision and demonstrate ways in which it can be mitigated. Trade-ins are examined as one way in which a consumer can be guided to make replacement purchase decisions that are more aligned with normative choice.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/4/433/1810416","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes related to product replacement without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this article, we examine how pre- and postpurchase comparisons affect regret and satisfaction, and whether consumers learn to avoid decisions that result in regret. In the first two experiments, we show that information learned after the purchase has a greater impact on satisfaction than information learned before the purchase. In addition, negative price comparisons have a greater impact on satisfaction than positive comparisons. These results imply that if consumers who receive postpurchase information wish to avoid future feelings of regret, they should defer their purchases longer. Our second two experiments demonstrate this phenomenon: Subjects who were exposed to postchoice information set higher decision thresholds, consistent with the minimization of future regret. Paradoxically, providing subjects with additional postchoice information resulted in decreased average earnings, suggesting that consumers may try to avoid future regret even when doing so conflicts with expected value maximization.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/4/447/1810421","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes related to purchase timing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In the context of a choice task, only attractive features were found to enhance individuals' already established preferences, and this effect was more pronounced for consumers with already established brand preferences compared to consumers who were indifferent to the options.

Recent research in categorization suggests that one strategy for creating representations for these new products is to use information already contained in familiar product categories. While knowledge from multiple existing categories may be relevant, little research has examined how (and if) consumers process information drawn from more than one domain. We use two experiments to demonstrate how consumers use cues from multiple categories to develop expectations about and preferences for new products. Our findings suggest that the first plausible category label provided to the consumer significantly influences their categorizations, expectations, and preferences. Only when advertisers place limits on the type of information to transfer from each existing category can consumers use information from multiple categories effectively.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/27/4/489/1810433","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and categorization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Over the period from 1962 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility relative to market volatility. Accordingly, correlations among individual stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given level of diversification has increased. All the volatility measures move together countercyclically and help to predict GDP growth. Market volatility tends to lead the other volatility series.

Additional results reveal that this underperformance is especially pronounced for small, low-credit-quality firms. Also, downgrades underperform in nearly all years in the sample, and a large part of the abnormal returns occur at subsequent earnings announcements. Thus, the evidence suggests that the poor returns result from an underreaction to the announcement of downgrades, rather than from lower systematic risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00322","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices."],["2001","56","1","Yihong Xia,\u00a0\n                     Yihong XiaThe author is from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Uncertainty about the predictive relation affects the optimal portfolio choice through dynamic learning, and leads to a state-dependent relation between the optimal portfolio choice and the investment horizon. There is substantial market timing in the optimal hedge demands, which is caused by stochastic covariance between stock return and dynamic learning.

We characterize the anomaly in the context of affine models of the term structure of interest rates. In affine models, the anomaly requires either that state variables have asymmetric effects on state prices in different currencies or that nominal interest rates take on negative values with positive probability. We find the quantitative properties of either alternative to have important shortcomings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00325","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of currency prices and interest rates without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2001","56","1","Torben G.

The practical significance is illustrated through tests for changes in the FX intraday volatility pattern following the removal of trading restrictions in Tokyo. Contrary to earlier evidence, we find nodiscernible changes outside of the Tokyo lunch period.

With idiosyncratic labor income risk, the optimal allocation to stocks is unambiguously larger for employed investors than for retired investors, consistent with the typical recommendations of investment advisors. Increasing idiosyncratic labor income risk raises investors' willingness to save and reduces their stock portfolio allocation towards the level of retired investors. Positive correlation between labor income and stock returns has a further negative effect and can actually reduce stockholdings below the level of retired investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00333","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio choice and labor income without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We test whether U.S. investors can extend their efficient set by investing in emerging markets when accounting for such frictions. For the period after the major liberalizations in the emerging markets, we find strong evidence for diversification benefits when market frictions are excluded, but this evidence disappears when investors face short sales constraints or small transaction costs.

We also examine how transitory volatility affects the mix between limit orders and market orders. When transitory volatility arises from the ask (bid) side, investors will submit more limit sell (buy) orders than market sell (buy) orders.

Using U.S. quarterly stock market data, we find that these fluctuations in the consumption\u2013wealth ratio are strong predictors of both real stock returns and excess returns over a Treasury bill rate. We also find that this variable is a better forecaster of future returns at short and intermediate horizons than is the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio, and several other popular forecasting variables. Why should the consumption\u2013wealth ratio forecast asset returns? We show that a wide class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the log consumption\u2013aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset holdings) ratio summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market portfolio. Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions under which its important predictive components for future asset returns may be expressed in terms of observable variables, namely in terms of consumption, asset holdings and labor income. The framework implies that these variables are cointegrated, and that deviations from this shared trend summarize agents' expectations of future returns on the market portfolio.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00347","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock market predictions and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In equilibrium, expected returns are linearly related to both risk and mispricing measures (e.g., fundamental/price ratios). With many securities, mispricing of idiosyncratic value components diminishes but systematic mispricing does not. The theory offers untested empirical implications about volume, volatility, fundamental/price ratios, and mean returns, and is consistent with several empirical findings. These include the ability of fundamental/price ratios and market value to forecast returns, and the domination of beta by these variables in some studies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00350","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and arbitrage without any mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2001","56","3","Wayne E.

Under mild assumptions, expected call returns exceed those of the underlying security and increase with the strike price. Likewise, expected put returns are below the risk-free rate and increase with the strike price. S&P index option returns consistently exhibit these characteristics. Under stronger assumptions, expected option returns vary linearly with option betas. However, zero-beta, at-the-money straddle positions produce average losses of approximately three percent per week.

We focus on an apparent paradox, namely the insistence of Neo-Austrians on order (i.e., stationarity) together with ever-reemerging inefficiencies. The paper's findings have implications beyond Neo-Austrian theory: They demonstrate how easy it is to reject market efficiency, but how much more difficult it is to discern the nature of the inefficiency. We illustrate our findings with price data from the U.S. Treasury bill market over the period 1962 to 1999. There is ample evidence that the price of a three-month Treasury bill is not a random walk, yet the sign of the average price change is erratic, so that inference about the nature of the inefficiency is unreliable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00353","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on Neo-Austrian economic theory and its application to financial markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although these models do not focus on the relation between corporate yields and swap rates (the LIBOR\u2013swap spread), they imply that the term structure of corporate yields and swap rates should be identical. As documented previously (e.g., in Sun, Sundaresan, and Wang (1993)) this is counterfactual. Here, we propose a model of the default risk imbedded in the swap term structure that is able to explain the LIBOR\u2013swap spread. Whereas corporate bonds carry default risk, we argue that swap contracts are free of default risk. Because swaps are indexed on \u201crefreshed\u201d-credit-quality LIBOR rates, the spread between corporate yields and swap rates should capture the market's expectations of the probability of deterioration in credit quality of a corporate bond issuer. We model this feature and use our model to estimate the likelihood of future deterioration in credit quality from the LIBOR\u2013swap spread. The analysis is important because it shows that the term structure of swap rates does not reflect the borrowing cost of a standard LIBOR credit quality issuer. It also has implications for modeling the dynamics of the swap term structure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00357","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial models and the analysis of swap rates without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Moreover, as a consequence of fee waivers, funds on average collect one half of reported expense ratios. Variation in fee waivers is significant and relates to differences in relative performance. Both low-performing retail and institutional funds waive fees to improve their net performance. More interestingly, high-performing retail, but not institutional, funds use fee waivers to strategically adjust net performance to increase expected fund flows. Despite fund flow incentives, high-performing institutional funds do not waive more because they cannot significantly improve their relative performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00358","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fee waivers and fund performance without addressing any social justice themes, ethical critiques, or diversity considerations.

These value differences must be due to differences in either future cash flows or future returns. Expected security returns on diversified firms vary systematically with relative value.

Slightly more than half of the cross-sectional variation in excess values is due to variation in expected future cash flows, with the remainder due to variation in expected future returns and to covariation between cash flows and returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00386","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial metrics related to diversified firms without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

Our model generates credit spreads that are larger for low-leverage firms, and less sensitive to changes in firm value, both of which are more consistent with empirical findings than predictions of extant models.

Although we consider several macroeconomic and financial variables as candidate proxies, we cannot explain this common systematic component.

Mutual funds typically set fund share price (NAV) using an algorithm that fails to account for nonsynchronous trading in the fund's underlying securities. This results in predictable changes in NAV, which lead to exploitable trading opportunities.

In particular, the paper assesses the impact of return predictability on portfolio choice for a multi-period investor with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 4. Compared to the investor's allocation in her last period, return predictability with dividend yield causes the investor early in life to tilt her risky-asset portfolio away from high book-to-market stocks and away from small stocks. These results are explained using Merton's (Econometrica 41 (1973) 867) characterization of portfolio allocation by a multi-period investor in a continuous time setting. Abnormal returns relative to the investor's optimal early life portfolio are also calculated. These abnormal returns are found to exhibit the same cross-sectional patterns as abnormal returns calculated relative to the market portfolio: higher for small rather than large firms, and higher for high rather than low book-to-market firms. Thus, hedging demand may be a partial explanation for the high expected returns documented for small firms and high book-to-market firms. However, even with this hedging demand, the investor wants to sell short the low book-to market portfolio to hold the high book-to-market portfolio. The utility costs of using a value-weighted equity index or of ignoring predictability are also calculated. An investor using a value-weighted equity index would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to book-to-market portfolio than size portfolios. Finally, an investor would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to dividend yield information than term spread information.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X01000745","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio allocation and return predictability without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

By assuming that the liquid assets are priced so that each portfolio of assets has negative expected return under at least one measure, we derive a counterpart to the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing.

Ostensibly, the reassessment of the traditional assumptions underlying entry barrier strategy has become imperative; to this end, the authors present a framework that investigates the contingent effects of incumbents' barrier building on their own performance. Specifically, the authors examine five types of entry barriers (capital requirements, cost advantages, switching costs, distribution access, and proprietary assets) for the nature of their impact in the following presupposed yet unresolved roles: (1) as effectual versus ineffectual entry deterrents and (2) as enablers versus inhibitors of incumbents' innovativeness. In addition, the authors take other variables into account (i.e., competitors' innovativeness and incumbents' market and technological orientation) to identify the contingencies of the framework. Using data from Korean consumer product industries, the authors empirically test and substantiate the variable (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) impact of entry barriers on incumbents' performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.65.1.1.18133","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on traditional business concepts such as entry barriers and market performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical issues.

Deconglomeration refers to the divestiture behavior of a conglomerate firm and the transformation of its business portfolio from one that is largely composed of several unrelated businesses to one composed of fewer and related businesses. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, the authors propose a conceptual model delineating the environmental and organizational drivers of deconglomeration and its outcomes for marketing. The authors suggest that after deconglomeration, (1) a firm can be expected to be more competitor and customer oriented, (2) multimarket contact with competing firms and seller concentration will increase, (3) businesses retained by the firm will be more innovative and place greater emphasis on advertising compared with sales promotion, and (4) the firm's culture may become more externally oriented. Furthermore, the locus of decision making for marketing strategy may shift more toward senior management levels. In summary, changes in a firm's corporate strategy could lead to significant changes in the marketing strategy of its business units.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.65.1.15.18129","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['strategy', 'deconglomeration', 'marketing']","The article primarily focuses on strategic and marketing concepts without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One method for creating value is to reduce costs in commercial exchange. The authors develop a model that explains how supplier behaviors and the management of suppliers affect a customer firm's direct product, acquisition, and operations costs. The model proposes that these costs mediate the relationship between buyer\u2013supplier relationship behaviors and the customer firm's intentions to expand future purchases from the supplier. The model is tested on data collected from almost 500 buying organizations in the United States and Germany. The results indicate that increased communication frequency, different forms of supplier accommodation, product quality, and the geographic closeness of the supplier's facilities to the customer's buying location lower customer firm costs.

In contrast, the authors use Procter & Gamble's (P&G's) value pricing strategy as an opportunity to study consumer and competitor response to a major, sustained change in marketing-mix strategy. They compile data across 24 categories in which P&G has a significant market share, covering the period from 1990 to 1996, during which P&G instituted major cuts in deals and coupons and substantial increases in advertising. The authors estimate an econometric model to trace how consumers and competitors react to such changes. For the average brand, the authors find that deals and coupons increase market penetration and surprisingly have little impact on customer retention as measured by share-of-category requirements and category usage. For the average brand, advertising works primarily by increasing penetration, but its effect is weaker than that of promotion. The authors find that competitor response is related to how strongly the competitor's market share is affected by the change in marketing mix and the competitor's own response and to structural factors such as market share position and multi-market contact. The net impact of these consumer and competitor responses is a decrease in market share for the company that institutes sustained decreases in promotion coupled with increases in advertising.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.65.1.44.18130","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing strategy and consumer behavior without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Received theory suggests that the salesperson's superior information about customers' valuations will invariably make price delegation profitable for the firm. The empirical evidence, however, reveals that firms that grant full pricing authority generate lower profits than firms that limit pricing authority. Given this state of affairs, the author develops and analyzes a formal model that examines the optimality of delegating pricing authority to the sales force. The model preserves the notion of superior information assumed in the literature but considers as well a negative feature of much concern to practitioners, namely, the suboptimal substitution of selling effort by price discounting. The model reveals that providing the salesperson with full pricing authority is not always optimal. Specifically, in some environments, it is appropriate to limit pricing authority because this decision forces the salesperson to target high-valuation customers. In addition, the model predicts that the commission rate offered to the salesperson should be higher when pricing authority is limited. The author concludes by summarizing the context, calculus, and implications of the model with a view to assisting managers charged with the price-delegation decision.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.65.1.62.18134","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing authority and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

The authors identify psychographic and demographic traits that potentially drive usage of store brands and national brand promotions. They then develop a framework and structural equation model to study the association of these traits with store brand and national brand promotion usage. The authors find that though demographics do not influence these behaviors directly, they have significant associations with psychographic characteristics and therefore are useful for market targeting. Most important, usage of store brands and usage of promotions, particularly out-of-store promotions, are associated with different psychographics. Store brand use correlates mainly with traits related to economic benefits and costs, whereas the use of out-of-store promotions is associated mainly with traits related to hedonic benefits and costs. These differences result in four well-defined and identifiable consumer segments: deal-focused consumers, store brand\u2013focused consumers, deal and store brand users (use-all), and nonusers of both store brands and deals (use-none). Therefore, manufacturers and retailers have the opportunity to either avoid each other or compete head to head, depending on which segment they target.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.65.1.71.18132","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['value-conscious', 'demographic traits', 'psychographic characteristics']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and market segmentation without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Drawing from research in social network theory with a focus on the strength-of-ties literature, the authors suggest that horizontal alliances have lower levels of relational embeddedness and higher levels of knowledge redundancy than vertical alliances. The authors then suggest that though embeddedness enhances both the acquisition and utilization of information in alliances, redundancy diminishes information acquisition but enhances information utilization. The authors test these ideas using a sample of 106 U.S. firms that recently have participated in new product alliances. Although the results are broadly supportive of the predictions, they are also surprising because they question key underlying assumptions of the strength-of-ties literature. For example, closely tied individual actors are typically assumed to share both high levels of embeddedness and high levels of redundancy, but the present research finds that this assumption does not hold for organizational actors.

Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs. Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions\u2014defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands)\u2014affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand\u2013size combination that was eliminated, nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered.

Despite tremendous retailer and manufacturer interest in the process of CM and its rapid adoption in the industry, much uncertainty exists about the consequences of CM for channel members. The present study focuses on how a shift to CM by a retailer affects its equilibrium prices, sales, and profitability in a competitive retail setting. On the basis of an analysis of a model of two competing national brand manufacturers that supply two competing common retailers, the authors find that one retailer's adoption of CM increases its average unit price of the category and reduces its sales volume and revenues. However, this retailer can still enjoy an increase in its gross margin profits as competing manufacturers\u2019 wholesale prices fall in the process. Also, the CM adopter's profits are greater than those of a symmetric competing retailer that follows the traditional brand-centered management of a product category when the interbrand competition is high but interstore competition is low. Applying the intervention analysis methodology, the authors empirically test several of these analytical findings, employing a unique data set that contains information about a supermarket chain's weekly average unit prices and sales of the laundry detergent category before and after this product category was moved to CM by the retailer. The propositions that adoption of CM will lead to higher retail prices and lower sales are upheld in this empirical study.

In this article, the authors propose and empirically estimate a descriptive model of firm product line decisions in the personal computer industry over the period 1981-92. The model incorporates the firm's initial choice of the direction of a product line change (i.e., the product line can be expanded, contracted, or maintained) and the conditional choice related to the magnitude of any product line change (i.e., how many products to introduce or withdraw). The authors show that there are important substantive insights to be gained by analyzing the product line decision in this fashion. In the personal computer industry, for example, firms expand their product lines when industry barriers are low or market opportunities are perceived to exist. High market share firms aggressively expand their product lines, as do firms with relatively high prices or short product lines.

This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.1.131.18832","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['customer characteristics', 'satisfaction', 'repurchase behavior']","The article discusses how customer characteristics influence satisfaction and repurchase behavior, indicating some awareness of diversity among consumers.

However, for discontinuous innovations, experts' entrenched knowledge is related to lower comprehension, fewer perceived net benefits, and lower preferences compared with that of novices.

The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and that intentional vaporware can deter entry. The authors also show that there is a curvilinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy; that is, firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, whereas firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data.

Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or \u201cdecoupling\u201d of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.1.30.18828","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of price bundling and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

How a particular channel member reacts to such an act has implications for the long-term viability and success of the relationship. On the basis of a large data set collected from both a focal supplier and its independent dealers, the authors classify dealers' responses to a supplier's destructive acts by extending the response typology of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is based on Hirschman's seminal writings on responses to decline in organizations and states. This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier. The results suggest that these more proximal dealer responses affect subsequent dealer performance and overall perceptions of relationship quality after an act.

The results of Study 1 show that the entrant's perceptions of the aggressiveness of the incumbent depend on the focus and strength of the incumbent's signals. The results of Study 2 show that the strength of the entrant's responses to the incumbent's signals depends on the incumbent's use of bluffs and the cost of information about the factors driving the incumbent's signals.

The author examines the relational impact of pie sharing in complex collaboration contexts marked by uncertainty in resources and output, information asymmetries, intangible aspects, and noncomparable factors and processes. The author develops a conceptual framework that examines how the use of equity and equality sharing principles in conjunction with various resource and organizational conditions can be used to affect relational outcomes systematically. Survey results of 300 research and development managers, scientists, and engineers indicate that sharing principles can have a positive or negative effect on the relationship depending on the type of sharing principle used and the characteristics of the resources and organizations. In particular, sharing processes should be responsive to the goals of the collaboration. The results underscore the strategic nature of the sharing phenomenon as well as the importance of relational concerns in complex and uncertain interorganizational settings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.1.86.18827","research article","JMR","Marketing","5","['equity', 'equality', 'collaboration', 'relational outcomes']","The article discusses principles of equity and equality in the context of organizational collaboration, indicating a moderate focus on social justice themes.

Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.2.143.18840","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['response styles', 'biasing effects', 'validity']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of marketing research and the validity of conclusions drawn from data, with minimal reference to social justice or ethical considerations.

Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks-and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer.

Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality.

These phenomena can produce complex nonlinearities and interactions in the deal effect curve that are best captured with a flexible approach. Because a fully nonparametric regression model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose a semiparametric regression model. Store-level sales over time are modeled as a non-parametric function of own- and cross-item price discounts and a parametric function of other predictors. The authors compare the predictive validity of the semiparametric model with that of two parametric benchmark models and obtain superior performance. The results for three product categories indicate threshold and saturation effects for both own-and cross-item temporary price cuts. The authors also find that the nature of the own-item curve depends on other items' price discounts. Comparisons with restricted model specifications show that both the flexible main effects and flexible interaction effects contribute to the superior results for the semiparametric approach. The interaction effects are so complex that it is unlikely for any parametric model to be satisfactory. In a separate analysis, the authors illustrate how the shape of the deal effect curve depends on own-item promotion signals. There is a crossover interaction effect: For the item analyzed, feature advertising produces a higher sales effect up to a 20% discount, whereas display achieves higher sales for discounts in excess of 20%.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.2.197.18842","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing analytics and does not address any socially progressive themes or issues related to diversity, equity, or ethics.

The authors propose customer characteristics and context-specific factors that may relate to differences in the key characteristics of the underlying source model of share of category requirements and word of mouth. The authors then assess the overall importance of the explanatory variables in the source model and simultaneously test for systematic differences related to CIC-specific factors using survey data from more than 1700 CICs that involve more than 60 brands. A key assumption in much prior research that has examined customer\u2013firm interactions is that CIC-specific factors, if they are included at all, create an automatic regularity that must be controlled for. The authors propose and find an additional effect. The responsiveness to factors under a firm's control varies across CICs, and therefore firms that adapt their processing have an advantage. Rather than provide a uniform response to all CICs, the authors' results offer managers several guidelines on how to customize their responses to the various CIC types and how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their firms' CIC management efforts.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.3.281.18863","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['customer-initiated contact', 'vendor performance', 'customer characteristics']","The article primarily focuses on customer behavior and vendor performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The key idea is to design a choice experiment in which television programs are rescheduled and presented to respondents. Respondents read these program schedules (much like the regular TV Guide listings) and give their preferences, including not watching any of the listed programs. Because there are potentially billions of possible schedules, the authors give a procedure for designing a fractional factorial experiment that can accommodate both programs of varying length and constraints on eligible program times. The authors also develop a latent class multinomial logit model for modeling program preferences and present a validation of our experimental procedure and the model. They also present an empirical test of the procedure in which they use the model to predict ratings for all the possible program schedules, not just those constituting the choice sets. In this example, the optimum schedule increases the predicted total weekly ratings during prime time by 18% for a network. The projected increase in total weekly ratings is achieved without the network needing to purchase any new programs; all it needs to do is reschedule eight programs in its existing prime-time lineup.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.38.3.298.18867","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimizing television program schedules to maximize ratings, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Brand-specific associations refer to features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand and that differentiate it from the competition. General brand impressions refer to general impressions about the brand that are based on a more holistic view of the brand.

In an empirical study, the authors examine the relationships among measures of product similarity in three different contexts: (1) goal-congruent products, (2) moderately goal-incongruent products, and (3) extremely goal-incongruent products. The results of exploratory factor analyses revealed that perceived similarity is a multidimensional construct and that the number and structure of these dimensions of similarity are different when products differ in their degrees of goal congruency. Structural equation analyses of the measures based on a second sample confirmed the structure obtained in the earlier exploratory analyses and demonstrated that brand attitudes and purchase intention exhibit different relationships to the underlying dimensions of similarity in the goal-congruent and goal-incongruent conditions, consistent with expectations based on the theory of goal-derived categorization.

For example, although the time path of the estimated price elasticities in a multiple-generation setting closely follows those reported previously for single generations, the authors find evidence of an important interaction in price response across generations.

The importance of join optimization is critically underscored by the high cost of relational joins and their frequent needs in traditional as well as emerging database applications. We demonstrate that the sequence in which the pages of the relations are accessed to process a join is a critical determinant of the join execution cost and an optimization of this sequence can lead to a significant improvement in performance over the traditional approaches. We initially develop three network structures to represent a join on two relations: page connectivity graph, cascade and block tree cascade. A page connectivity graph is a bipartite representation of the set of connected pages in the two relations according to the join predicate. To reveal the structural properties of the join, the nodes of the bipartite graph are ordered into a set of levels, and the resulting isomorphic structure is termed a cascade. From the cascade, a tree structure termed a block tree cascade is derived by selectively grouping nodes at each level of the cascade into blocks. We formulate the join as a tree traversal process, and accordingly develop efficient tree traversal algorithms. We develop a compact data structure to store the resulting access path, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithms with detailed assessments of their performance. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach can result in significant cost savings over the current join processing methods, for low to modest values of the join selectivity factor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.1.2.9746","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of join optimization in relational database systems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In particular, the dynamic nature of uncertainty that is so characteristic of online models, where estimates and distributions evolve in parallel with the state of the model, has been largely ignored. In this paper, we present a new representation for uncertainty in online models. This representation is object-oriented and, as such, provides several important software-engineering advantages over traditional representations for uncertainty. Moreover, by using the event listener paradigm it provides an explicit mechanism for handling dynamic uncertainty in an elegant and extensible manner. A series of computational experiments demonstrates that there is no significant overhead to our representation when compared to traditional representations on a realistic application and, in some cases, our representation can be noticeably faster.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.1.29.9749","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online operations research models and uncertainty representation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Balas (1996) has proposed a dynamic-programming algorithm that solves this problem in time linear in n, though exponential in k. Some important real-world problems are amenable to this model or some of its close relatives. The algorithm of Balas (1996) constructs a layered network with a layer of nodes for each position in the tour, such that source-sink paths in this network are in one-to-one correspondence with tours that satisfy the postulated precedence constraints. In this paper we discuss an implementation of the dynamic-programming algorithm for the general case when the integer k is replaced with city-specific integers k(j), j = 1, . . ., n. We discuss applications to, and computational experience with, TSPs with time windows, a model frequently used in vehicle routing as well as in scheduling with setup, release and delivery times. We also introduce a new model, the TSP with target times, applicable to Just-in-Time scheduling problems. Finally for TSPs that have no precedence restrictions, we use the algorithm as a heuristic that finds in linear time a local optimum over an exponential-size neighborhood. For this case, we implement an iterated version of our procedure, based on contracting some arcs of the tour produced by a first application of the algorithm, then reapplying the algorithm to the shrunken graph with the same k.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.1.56.9748","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical algorithms related to the traveling-salesman problem without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An approximate solution method is developed, which employs constraint generation for bound tightening, and heuristics based on rounding of a linear programming solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.1.76.9750","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network design and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus receiving a low 'woke' score."],["2001","13","2","Dorit S.

Each machine processes operations in batches, and the processing time of a batch is the sum of the processing times of the operations in that batch. A setup time, which depends only on the machine, is required before a batch is processed on a machine, and all jobs in a batch remain at the machine until the entire batch is processed. The aim is to make batching and sequencing decisions, which specify a partition of the jobs into batches on each machine, and a processing order of the batches on each machine, respectively, so that the makespan is minimized. The flow-shop problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. We demonstrate that there is an optimal solution with the same batches on the two machines; we refer to these as consistent batches. A heuristic is developed that selects the best schedule among several with one, two, or three consistent batches, and is shown to have a worst-case performance ratio of 4/3. For the open-shop, we show that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense. By proving the existence of an optimal solution with one, two or three consistent batches, a close relationship is established with the problem of scheduling two or three identical parallel machines to minimize the makespan. This allows a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to be derived, and various heuristic methods to be suggested.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.2.120.10521","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and batching in operational environments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The salesman moves at no more than unit speed and starts and ends his work at a designated origin. The objective is to find a routing for the salesman that finishes as early as possible. Performance of algorithms is measured through their competitive ratio, comparing the outcome of the algorithms with that of an adversary who provides the problem instance and therefore is able to achieve the optimal offline solution. Objections against such omnipotent adversaries have lead us to devise an adversary that is in a natural way, in the context of routing problems, more restricted in power. For the exposition we consider the online traveling salesman problem on the metric space given by \u211d0+, the non-negative part of the real line. We show that a very natural strategy is 3/2-competitive against the conventional adversary, which matches the lower-bound on competitive ratios achievable for algorithms for this problem. Against the more \u201cfair adversary\u201d, that we propose, we show that there exists an algorithm with competitive ratio (1 + \u221a17)/4 \u2248 1.28 and provide a matching lower bound.

Using supplementary-variable and embedded-Markov-chain techniques, the queue is analyzed only for the early arrival system. Since the late arrival system can be discussed similarly, it is not considered here. In addition to developing relations among state probabilities at prearrival, arbitrary, and outside observer's observation epochs, the numerical evaluation of state probabilities is also discussed. It is also shown that, in the limiting case, the relations developed here tend to continuous-time counterparts. Further, the waiting-time distribution of a random customer of a batch is obtained.

The strategy uses a node-arc formulation and combines constraints whenever multiple working paths affected by an edge failure have identical origins or destinations. Another unique feature of this model is the inclusion of modularity restrictions corresponding to the discrete capacities of the equipment used in telecommunication networks. The new model can be solved using a classical branch-and-bound algorithm with a linear-programming relaxation. A preprocessing module is developed, which generates a set of cuts that strengthens this linear programming relaxation. The overhead associated with the cuts is offset by the improved bounds produced. A new branch-and-bound algorithm is developed that exploits the modularity restrictions. In an extensive empirical analysis, a software implementation of this algorithm was found to be substantially faster than CPLEX 6.5.3. For a test suite of 50 problems, each having 50 nodes and 200 demands from a uniform distribution with a small variance, our new software obtained solutions guaranteed to be within 4% of optimality in five minutes of CPU time on a DEC AlphaStation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.3.181.12629","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical mathematical model and algorithm development without any mention of socially progressive themes, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Our approach is based on an integer linear programming formulation of a graph-theoretic relaxation of the problem, calling for a decomposition of the edge set of a bicolored graph into the maximum number of alternating cycles. The formulation has one variable for each alternating cycle, and the associated linear programming relaxation is solved by column generation. A major advantage with respect to previous approaches is that the subproblem to face in the column-generation phase no longer requires the solution of min-cost general matching problems, but of min-cost bipartite matching problems. Experiments show that there is a tremendous speed-up in going from general matching to bipartite matching, although the best-known algorithms for the two problems have the same theoretical worst-case complexity. We also show the worst-case ratio between the lower bound value obtained by our new method and previous ones. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive computational experiments. In particular, we can solve to proven optimality the largest real-world instances from the literature in a few seconds, and the other (smaller) real-world instances within a few milliseconds on a workstation. Moreover, we can solve to optimality random instances with n + 100 within 3 seconds, and with n + 200 within 15 minutes, where n is the size of the permutation, whereas the size of the instances solvable by previous approaches was at most 100.

The class of problems considered in this paper have the characteristic that only a subset of the binary variables have non-zero objective function coefficients if modeled as an MILP. This class of problems is formulated as a hybrid MILP/CP model that involves some of the MILP constraints, a reduced set of the CP constraints, and equivalence relations between the MILP and the CP variables. An MILP/CP based decomposition method and an LP/CP-based branch-and-bound algorithm are proposed to solve these hybrid models. Both these algorithms rely on the same relaxed MILP and feasibility CP problems. An application example is considered in which the least-cost schedule has to be derived for processing a set of orders with release and due dates using a set of dissimilar parallel machines. It is shown that this problem can be modeled as an MILP, a CP, a combined MILP-CP OPL model (Van Hentenryck 1999), and a hybrid MILP/CP model. The computational performance of these models for several sets shows that the hybrid MILP/CP model can achieve two to three orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.4.258.9733","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization methods without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

For six selected stochastic systems, we summarize an extensive numerical analysis of the convergence to steady-state limits of these moment conditions; and for two systems we present a simulation-based analysis exemplifying the corresponding convergence in distribution of the components of the NOBM t-ratio.

The estimator uses the concept of a phantom system, together with the basic ideas in harmonic gradient estimation, to develop a single simulation run estimator, termed the phantom harmonic gradient (PHG) estimator. The estimator is shown to be strongly consistent and strongly consistent in the average sense as the sample size grows. An upper bound for the variance of the PHG estimator is presented. This bound is used to show that under mild conditions, the variance of the PHG estimator tends to zero as both the number of phantom systems and the sample size approach infinity. A variance-reduction technique that simultaneously uses both common and antithetic random numbers is presented. Computational results on several nonpreemptive queueing systems illustrate the effectiveness of the method and show that common and antithetic random numbers can be used simultaneously to reduce the variance of the phantom harmonic gradient estimator.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.13.4.345.9731","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and gradient estimation without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

However, as noted by Ward et al. (1995), an understanding of the factors that influence operations strategy development has not been widely studied. Further, how managers of firms in underdeveloped countries develop operations strategy has yet to receive any significant attention among researchers. This paper takes a look at the development of operations strategy in an underdeveloped economy, Ghana. Specifically, the paper examines the relationships between the business environment and the operations strategy choices made by firms in Ghana. The paper seeks to understand the influence that specific business environmental factors have on the operations strategy choices of low cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery dependability.\n            \n            A survey of manufacturing firms was carried out in 1998. The respondents (production managers in those firms) were asked to indicate the extent to which business costs, labor availability, competitive hostility, and environmental dynamism were of concern to them. They were also asked to indicate their extent of emphasis on the operations strategy choices of quality, cost, flexibility and delivery dependability. This paper presents the result of the analysis of the relationships between the environmental factors and the operations strategy choices. The data indicate that, among firms in Ghana, the two strongest factors that influence the degree of emphasis placed on operations strategy choices are perceived business costs and competitive hostility. Results are presented for both large and small firms, and for firms that are completely locally owned as well as for joint venture firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900046-2","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['emerging economy', 'underdeveloped', 'business environment']","The article discusses operations strategy in the context of an underdeveloped economy, which indicates some awareness of socio-economic factors.

Concurrent engineering (CE) is a mechanism that can reduce uncertainty and equivocality and improve an organization\u2019s competitive capabilities. CE is typically manifested through concurrent work-flows, product development teams, and early involvement of constituents. It enables information to flow through the organization quickly and effectively thereby, reducing uncertainty. At the same time, it enables debate, clarification, and enactment which are essential elements in combating equivocality. CE practices are also purported to have significant effects on product innovation, quality, and premium price capabilities.\n            \n            This research carefully defines CE and creates a valid and reliable instrument to assess it. It reports on the development and testing of a model that relates CE to some of its most salient consequences. Half of the sample of 244 firms is used for exploratory purposes and half for confirmatory work and hypotheses testing. Results indicate that firms that experience a high technological and product change in their environment are using more CE practices. In addition, results suggest that CE practices have significant direct effects on product innovation. However, only the indirect effects of CE on quality and premium pricing are statistically significant. Firms with higher levels of product innovation have higher levels of quality. Firms with higher levels of product innovation do exhibit premium pricing capabilities but only if they affect quality capabilities. Firms that display elevated quality levels excel in their premium pricing capabilities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900048-6","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of concurrent engineering and its impact on product innovation and pricing, without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Prior work in this area has tended to focus primarily on the involvement of the manufacturing executive in strategic decision making processes, while relatively little attention has been given to the level of influence enjoyed by the manufacturing executives. This study jointly examines the role of both influence and involvement in achieving better business performance, which we posit is expected to occur through alignment between the organizational and manufacturing strategies rather than directly. A research model based on procedural justice and strategic information management literature is proposed to represent this phenomenon. Structural equation modeling is used to empirically test the research model and its related hypothesis on the basis of data collected from 202 senior manufacturing executives representing mid to large sized firms from diverse industry groups across the US. In addition, interviews with a sub-sample of respondents are used to further explore the contextual nature of these relationships. The results indicate that involvement and influence are indeed two different, but highly related, aspects of the manufacturing executive s role. The interviews revealed numerous differences between the two with respect to achieving each and individual benefits derived from them. As expected, both involvement and influence are important determinants of strategy alignment with influence appearing to play a more substantive role. More importantly, it is this alignment that affects business performance. Implications of our findings for improving manufacturing practice, along with possible avenues for future research directions in this area, are also provided.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900050-4","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['influence', 'involvement', 'alignment']","The article discusses the roles of influence and involvement in manufacturing strategy, which touches on organizational dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

Although proponents cite the many benefits of JIT adoption, its implementation rate in the US has been relatively conservative. This study uses survey responses from executives at 95 JIT-practicing firms to better understand the benefits that firms have experienced through JIT adoption, and whether a more comprehensive implementation is worthwhile. The research results demonstrate that implementing the quality, continuous improvement, and waste reduction practices embodied in the JIT philosophy can enhance firm competitiveness.

A critical part of mass customization is simultaneously achieving customer responsiveness, cost efficiency, and high volume production in the manufacturing system. This research describes mass customization and provides a framework to understand the relationships among time-based manufacturing practices, mass customization, and value to the customer. It involves the development of an instrument to measure mass customization. Data were collected from 303 manufacturing firms of various size, location, and industry to develop the instrument and test the relationships in the framework. The primary research method was structural equation modeling using LISREL. The study indicates that firms with high levels of time-based manufacturing practices have high levels of mass customization and value to the customer. Also, firms with high levels of mass customization have high levels of value to customer.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900056-5","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing and customer value without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Postponement means delaying activities in the supply chain until customer orders are received with the intention of customizing products, as opposed to performing those activities in anticipation of future orders. This paper reviews the literature on postponement dating back to 1965, and puts it in a systematic framework. In light of the classification of the literature developed, opportunities are identified for integration and cross-fertilization between research papers in disciplines such as logistics and operations management and between the variety of research methods used. Some directions for research (in terms of content and methodology) are then formulated. For instance, the development of a more integrated supply chain perspective on postponement, and the application of triangulation rather than single methods.

Opportunities for timely introduction of valuable or even preemptive technologies can be missed because unit cost comparisons, typically applied to a limited set of vehicle configurations with volumes based on current demand figures, invariably favor incumbent over new technologies. In this research, we develop a more complete technology adoption decision model that integrates product mix and technology adoption decisions. Specifically, we recognize that product mix and volume are important variables in determining the cost effectiveness of new technologies, and include in the model customer demand projections that reflect market trends (e.g. growing demand for increasingly sophisticated features and functions in vehicles). Anticipated experience benefits are then applied to the appropriate production volumes to more accurately predict the profit impact of adopting new technologies. The introduction of automotive multiplexing, a technology that is characteristic of current technological advances in the industry, provides a context for considering insights that can be derived from the decision model. Our interaction with a global Tier I automotive systems supplier allowed us to obtain representative cost data and other information relevant to the technology adoption decision.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900058-9","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical and profit-driven aspects of technology adoption in the automobile industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While the strategic implications of expanding services from a domestic market to an international location have been well documented, multicultural customer segments at one location is a unique problem that has largely been neglected by researchers. This paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting a conceptual framework and method for determining the extent of service product and process attribute standardization versus customization in these settings. The paper presents an approach for modeling the preferences of different cultural segments, evaluating the differences between the segments and determining the appropriate service strategy for service providers. We evaluate the effects of competitors adopting their revenue maximizing strategy both independently of each other and simultaneously while assuming the size of the market is viewed as a zero sum game. In an actual application at an international airport terminal, one food-service vendor implemented the suggested operations strategy and the result was a significant revenue gain over the previous year\u2019s sales during the same period. The method has valuable implications for managers when developing strategies for delivering a service to multicultural customer segments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900059-0","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['multicultural', 'service strategy', 'cultural segments']","The article addresses the unique challenges of servicing multicultural customer segments, indicating a moderate focus on diversity and inclusion.

The characteristics examined are firm size, the degree of capital intensity, the degree of diversification, the timing of TQM implementation, and the maturity of the program. We find that smaller firms do significantly better than larger firms. Firms that have won awards from independent award (a proxy for more mature TQM implementation) do significantly better than just supplier award winners. The evidence weakly supports the hypotheses that less capital-intensive firms do better than more capital-intensive firms, and more focused firms do better than more diversified firms. Finally, we do not observe any significant differences between the performance of earlier and later implementers of effective TQM.\n            \n            The key implications of these results are that many organizational characteristics moderate the benefits of TQM implementation. Although not all of these characteristics are controllable by managers, managers must set realistic expectations for the degree of benefits from TQM. The results for size and capital-intensity validate the importance of TQM practices for smaller firms and environments that are more labor intensive. Investing to achieve a broader, deeper, and more mature TQM implementation (possibly by targeting an independent TQM award) should also result in higher benefits from TQM implementation. Furthermore, the results indicate that it is never too late to invest in TQM.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900049-8","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of total quality management and financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Operations managers constantly struggle to seek answers to the right set of managerial actions that can be used to leverage technology for process effectiveness. This study takes a step in that direction by empirically examining the management of computer aided design (CAD) technology and outcomes of the product design process within manufacturing firms. In particular, the level of functionality and sophistication of the CAD system are examined with respect to the use of several structural and infrastructural management levers such as the degree of a firm\u2019s formalization and decentralization, the extent of the use of teams, the extent of training of CAD designers, and the equity of the incentives within the product design process. The influence of these management levers upon the CAD system performance is analyzed through the use of moderated regression analysis conducted on a cross-sectional data of 143 firms representing the vehicular industry in the USA. Our findings indicate that CAD functionality and sophistication are positively related to product design quality, flexibility, and overall performance. The impact of management levers on this relationship is a mixed one. Decentralization has no impact on the CAD technology\u2013performance relationship, formalization has some positive effects, and the use of teams is helpful only in moderating the influence of sophistication on overall performance. Equity of incentives enhances design quality, while training is very important in improving performance across the board. In general, sophisticated \u201cstate of the art\u201d CAD systems require much more proactive management than highly functional ones. Recommendations emerging from this study hopefully provide insights into a better management of not only CAD systems, but other process level technologies as well that are relevant to firms in the manufacturing sector. We also discuss implications of technology management provided by this research for creating leading edge enterprises.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900063-2","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['equity', 'management practices', 'training']","The article discusses 'equity of incentives' and 'training' as important factors in management practices, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations within the context of operations management.

We model and test their relationships to each other and to financial performance. We also examine two context variables as antecedent to knowledge: they are demand unpredictability (a dimension of environmental uncertainty) and mass output orientation (a measure of production technology type). The results show that knowledge completely mediates the effects of context on financial performance; i.e. the context variables impact knowledge and knowledge impacts financial performance, but the context variables have no direct effect on financial performance. Thus, knowledge appears to shield the firm from demand unpredictability, while mass output orientation type affects financial performance only through its impact on knowledge.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900067-X","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational knowledge and financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper reports on an empirical comparison of two configuration-based typologies: the Product\u2013process matrix and the more recent generic manufacturing strategies model. Since there is substantial conceptual overlap between these models, a simultaneous examination provides insights about both models, and in particular, about the value-added of the generic manufacturing strategies model.\n            \n            We examine hypotheses derived from these typologies using data from manufacturing plants in the United States, Italy, United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany; and from the automotive, machinery, and electronics industries. The data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and hierarchical regression techniques. Our results indicate support for the Product\u2013process matrix \u2014 lending further strength to a growing base of empirical research on this model. Our findings also provide support for the generic manufacturing strategies model with respect to various measures of cost, cycle time/inventory, quality, and innovation performance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the generic manufacturing strategies model is a useful augmentation to the Product\u2013process matrix. These findings suggest that the generic manufacturing strategy model has merit but deserves further empirical and theoretical attention.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900046-8","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical testing of manufacturing strategies without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We maintain that purchasing is a strategic contributor to the firm, and that the selection and retention of external suppliers is a fundamental and strategic purchasing task that manifests the function\u2019s competitive priorities. Researchers and managers increasingly view the operations and purchasing functions as intimately linked, and as playing important roles in supply chain management. Ultimately, the performance of the operations management system, measured in terms of quality, cost, delivery and flexibility, depends on inputs secured by the purchasing function from the firm\u2019s suppliers. However, in a search for substantive relationships, the purchasing literature has largely overlooked methodological issues such as measurement. Using empirical data collected from North American purchasing executives, a confirmatory factor analysis provides evidence that purchasing\u2019s competitive priorities may be conceptualized similarly to the competitive priorities in operations, with key differences. The measures satisfy key measurement criteria including unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and reliability. Five competitive priorities form the basis of a multidimensional measure of purchasing\u2019s competitive priorities, the individual factors of which will allow for the examination of linkages between purchasing, operations and other parts of the supply chain.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900047-X","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on developing measures for purchasing competitive priorities without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The Baldrige model of quality management for the health care industry is tested here using data from 220 US hospitals. Results of confirmatory structural equation modeling show that many of the hypothesized causal relationships in the Baldrige model are statistically significant. For example, Leadership (Baldrige Category 1.0) is identified as a driver of all components in the Baldrige System, including Information and Analysis, Strategic Planning, Human Resource Development and Management, and Process Management. This study also clarifies and improves understanding of within-System performance relationships. Baldrige components of Leadership and Information and Analysis are significantly linked with Organizational Performance Results while Human Resource Development and Management and Process Management significantly link with Customer Satisfaction. In addition, a comprehensive \u201cmeasurement model\u201d grounded in the Baldrige Health Care Criteria for the 28 dimensions of measurement is developed, tested, and found to be valid and reliable. This valid and reliable measurement model allows a fair test of the \u201cstructural model\u201d, which tests the relationships among the Baldrige model constructs.

It is the objective of this paper to highlight the merits and pitfalls of the CC/BM scheduling approach. Following a short overview of the fundamentals of CC/BM, the strengths and weaknesses of the approach are put into perspective, based on a critical analysis of the literature as well as our own experimentation with commercial CC/BM software. The CC/BM scheduling mechanism is tested in a full factorial experiment performed on a set of benchmark problems. It appears that the 50% rule for buffer sizing may lead to a serious overestimation of the required buffer protection. Regularly updating the baseline schedule and the critical chain provides the best intermediate estimates of the final project duration and yields the smallest final project duration. Using clever project scheduling and rescheduling mechanisms such as branch-and-bound, has a beneficiary effect on the final makespan.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900054-7","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management and scheduling without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

It was introduced in 1988 as the foundation for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The framework was significantly revised in 1992 and 1997. In order to test the validity of the theoretical model underlying the Baldrige framework as it has evolved over the years, we take the approach of analyzing the constructs upon which the Baldrige categories are based. Path analysis is used to test the fit of each of the three major frameworks, and the sums of direct effects are used to estimate the category weights implied by each of the path models. We found that all three frameworks were a good fit with the Baldrige frameworks for those years, and that both the 1992 and 1997 frameworks improved upon the foundation established by the 1988 framework. Thus, we conclude that appropriate adaptations to the Baldrige framework have been made over the years.

Adopters were driven by utilitarian outcomes, hedonic outcomes (i.e., fun), and social outcomes (i.e., status) from adoption.  Non-adopters, on the other hand, were influenced primarily by rapid changes in technology and the consequent fear of obsolescence.  A second wave of data collection conducted six months after the initial survey indicated an asymmetrical relationship between intent and behavior, with those who did not intend to adopt a PC following more closely with their intent than those who intended to adopt one.

However, current technology can affect not only how we communicate but also what we communicate. As a result, the issue for designers of communication support systems has become broader: how should technology be designed to make communication more effective by changing the medium and the attributes of the message itself?  The answer to this question requires a shift from current preoccupations with the medium of communication to a view that assesses the balance between medium and message form.  There is also a need to look more closely at the process of communication in order to identify more precisely any potential areas of computer support.\n\nThis paper provides the spadework for a new model of organizational communication, and uses it to review existing research, as well as to suggest directions for future research and development.  Beginning with the crucial aspects of action, relationship, and choice, an integrated model of how people communicate is developed. This model incorporates three basic factors: (1) inputs to the communication process (task, sender-receiver distance, and values and norms of communication with a particular emphasis on inter-cultural communication); (2) a cognitive-affective process of communication; and (3) the communication impact on action and relationship. The glue that bonds these factors together is a set of communication strategies aimed at reducing the complexity of communication. \n\nThe model provides a balance between relationship and action, between cognition and affect, and between message and medium. Such a balance has been lacking in previous work, and we believe it reflects a more realistic picture of communication behavior in organizations. A set of propositions generated from the model sets an agenda for studying the communication process as well as its inputs and outputs. Furthermore, this knowledge of the mechanisms that guide behavior is used to demonstrate the potential for developing design principles for future communication support systems.","https://misq.umn.edu/review-a-cognitive-affective-model-of-organizational-communication-for-designing-it.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['inter-cultural communication', 'communication strategies', 'values and norms']","The article discusses the importance of inter-cultural communication and the values and norms that influence communication processes, which indicates a moderate focus on social considerations.

We further suggest that the transformations currently occurring in the nature of work and organizing cannot be understood without considering both the technological changes and the institutional contexts that are reshaping economic and organizational activity.  Thus, greater interaction between the fields of information technology and organization studies should be viewed as more than a matter of enrichment.

This paper develops a new model for interpreting GSS effects on performance (a Fit-Appropriation Model), which argues that GSS performance is affected by two factors.  The first is the fit between the task and the GSS structures selected for use (i.e., communication support and information processing support).  The second is the appropriation support the group receives in the form of training, facilitation, and software restrictiveness to help them effectively incorporate the selected GSS structures into their meeting process.  A meta-analysis using this model to organize and classify past research found that when used appropriately (i.e., there is a fit between the GSS structures and the task, and the group receives appropriation support), GSS use increased the number of ideas generated, took less time, and led to more satisfied participants than if the group worked without the GSS.  Fitting the GSS to the task had the most impact on outcome effectiveness (decision quality and ideas), while appropriation support had the most impact on the process (time required and process satisfaction).  We conclude that when using this theoretical lens, the results of GSS research do not appear inconsistent.","https://misq.umn.edu/understanding-fit-and-appropriation-effects-in-group-support-systems-via-meta-analysis.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['support', 'appropriation', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of Group Support Systems (GSS) and their performance, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, established groups (i.e., groups with a history of working together) can view and use the same technology differently from groups without any past experiences of working together.  This study examines the relative influences of media condition and group cohesion on social presence, task participation, and group consensus. Results from a controlled laboratory experiment with 45 triads of college students working on a decision-making task showed that media condition (audio conferencing vs. desktop videoconferencing) has significantly smaller influences on social presence and task participation than group cohesion in established groups. The study found that influence of group cohesion over social presence is additive, rather than substitutive, to that of media condition.

Five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users.  The results suggest that users\u2019 continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use.

This study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of IS continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of IS use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring IS continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.","https://misq.umn.edu/understanding-information-systems-continuance-an-expectation-confirmation-model.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive beliefs and user satisfaction regarding information systems without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Based on theories of social exchange and social comparison, we hypothesize differences in work attitudes, behaviors, and performance across the two groups, and evaluate our hypotheses with a sequential mixed-methods design. Our first study surveys contract and permanent professionals on software development teams in a large transportation company. Our second study involves in-depth interviews with contract and permanent IS professionals in three organizations. We find support for many of our hypotheses but also some surprising results. Contrary to our predictions, contractors perceive a more favorable work environment than permanent professionals but exhibit lower in-role and extra-role behaviors than their permanent counterparts. Supervisors perceive their contract subordinates as lower-performing and less loyal, obedient, and trustworthy. In-depth interviews help to explain these findings. Job design emerges as an important factor influencing contractors\u2019 work attitudes, behaviors, and performance. Supervisors restrict the scope of contractors\u2019 jobs, limiting their job behaviors and performance. To compensate, permanent professionals are assigned considerably enlarged job scopes, leading to their lower perceptions of the work environment. We propose a theoretical model that embraces job design in explaining differences in work outcomes for contract versus permanent professionals on software development teams. The results from our study imply that organizations should carefully design and balance the jobs of their contractors and permanent employees to improve attitudes, behaviors, and workplace performance.","https://misq.umn.edu/work-outcomes-and-job-design-for-contract-versus-permanent-information-systems-professionals-on-software-development-teams.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","4","['job design', 'work attitudes', 'permanent professionals', 'contractors']","The article discusses job design and its impact on work attitudes and performance, indicating a consideration of workplace equity and employee experiences.

Some measures have a narrow focus while others aggregate innovative behaviors across a set of innovations or stages in the assimilation lifecycle.  There appear to be some significant tradeoffs involving aggregation:  more aggregated measures can be more robust and generalizable and can promote stronger predictive validity, while less aggregated measures allow more context-specific investigations and can preserve clearer theoretical interpretations. This article begins with a conceptual analysis that identifies the circumstances when these tradeoffs are most likely to favor aggregated measures.  It is found that aggregation should be favorable when: (1) the researcher's interest is in general innovation or a model that generalizes to a class of innovations, (2) antecedents have effects in the same direction in all assimilation stages, (3) characteristics of organizations can be treated as constant across the innovations in the study, (4) characteristics of innovations can not be treated as constant across organizations in the study, (5) the set of innovations being aggregated includes substitutes or moderate complements, and (6) sources of noise in the measurement of innovation may be present. The article then presents an empirical study using data on the adoption of software process technologies by 608 U.S. based corporations. This study\u2014which had circumstances quite favorable to aggregation\u2014 found that aggregating across three innovations within a technology class more than doubled the variance explained compared to single innovation models.  Aggregating across assimilation stages also had a slight positive effect on predictive validity.  Taken together, these results provide initial confirmation of the conclusions from the conceptual analysis regarding the circumstances favoring aggregation.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-role-of-aggregation-in-the-measurement-of-it-related-organizational-innovation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of measuring organizational innovation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A common practice for supermarkets is to communicate price deals on some products through newspaper advertisements, while communicating discounts on other products through in-store mechanisms such as shelf-talkers. This raises the question: So far as store choice is concerned, how might consumers take into account not only advertised prices at competing stores, but also expected prices of unadvertised goods? It also begs the question of why stores have unadvertised specials since their effect on store choice is not quite the same as the advertised discounts. Further, competing supermarkets advertise the same products part of the time, and different products at other times. They also tend to sometimes advertise a product in consecutive weeks, but sometimes not. Can these actions be part of a strategy? We formulate a game-theoretic model of retail competition by first extending the work of Lal and Matutes (1994) and then developing an alternative framework to answer these questions. Our model has two retailers, each of whom carries two goods. To simplify exposition, we assume that the stores are symmetric, the two goods are symmetric in their reservation prices, and are neither substitutes nor complements. Consumers are identical in their preferences and consumer heterogeneity is in the convenience that each store presents to a representative consumer. The stores may advertise the price of one good, reflecting the reality that stores do not advertise their whole assortment. They compete through advertising and prices to maximize profits. We thus recognize the strategic role of advertised prices and furthermore, we investigate the strategic role of unadvertised prices in retail competition. For this model, we derive a Rational Expectations Nash equilibrium in which each store randomly advertises the price of one good following a mixed strategy. Consumer expectations of the prices of the unadvertised goods are rational. We obtain three kinds of results. First, unadvertised specials occur in equilibrium, and induce temporal and cross-sectional variation in the identity of advertised goods, consistent with casual observation. In this equilibrium, the two stores advertise the same good part of the time and different goods at other times. When they advertise the same good they do not offer any unadvertised discount on the other good. However, when they advertise different goods, they offer an unadvertised discount on the good that they do not advertise. Intuitively, unadvertised discounts come about because stores randomize the identity of the advertised good in the mixed strategy equilibrium. If retailers were to advertise the same good at all times, they would have to compete intensely for store traffic and therefore discount the advertised good very deeply. And, having done so, they would find it optimal to set the unadvertised good at the reservation price and offer no discount on it. However, if stores randomize the advertised good as shown in this paper, both stores advertise the same good some of the time and at other times they advertise different goods. Because they advertise different goods some of the time, they do not fight intensely for store traffic on just one good, but rather they find it optimal to offer a discount on the unadvertised good also. As a result, an implication of our equilibrium for consumer choice is that unadvertised discounts affect store choice, and in equilibrium some consumers may shop around. Second, we obtain managerial insights into the role of unadvertised specials. They affect store choice, prevent consumer shopping around either fully or partly, and reduce head-to-head competition on the price of the advertised good. The most salient  strategic implication of retailers' offering unadvertised discounts is to reduce competition among stores, and this is again due to the randomization strategy of the stores. In fact, stores can reduce head-to-head competition further by increasing the number of products in their assortment and randomizing on the advertised good from this assortment. Third, we provide a resolution of the Diamond (1971) paradox, which says that prices at competing stores approach the monopoly price. In our equilibrium, expected prices of both advertised and unadvertised goods are always below the monopoly price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.20.1.61.10199","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price communication and competition among supermarkets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Third, placing a sale sign on a product reduces the perceived likelihood that the product will be available at a lower price in the future, but the effect is smaller when more products have sale signs.

If lower-quality products are sufficiently attractive, higher-valuation consumers may find it beneficial to buy lower-quality products rather than the higher-quality products targeted to them. That is, lower-quality products can potentially cannibalize higher-quality products. The cannibalization problem forces the firm to provide only the highest-valuation segment with its preferred (efficient) quality.

Such cases occur especially when historical data are either absent or are not representative of the current market situation. We argue that inferring market responses using cross-sections of multimarket data may in some cases be misleading because these data also reflect unobserved actions by retailers. For example, because the (opportunity) costs of doing so do not outweigh the gains, retailers are predisposed against promoting small share brands.

Previous studies argue that they are a marketing tactic that facilitates implicit price collusion. This is because once a store adopts this marketing tactic, its rivals can no longer steal its customers by undercutting its price, and hence they have little incentive to initiate price cuts. While a store with price-matching guarantees has no fear of losing customers to rivals' price cuts, it has every incentive to raise its own price to charge a higher price to its loyal consumers. A growing body of legal literature uses this argument today to justify calls for antitrust actions against stores employing this marketing tactic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.20.3.300.9766","","MKS","Marketing","2","['price-matching', 'antitrust', 'collusion']","The article discusses marketing tactics and legal implications related to price-matching guarantees, focusing primarily on competitive strategies rather than social justice or ethical concerns.

Yet there are occasions in which firms forgo the opportunity to price discriminate and instead charge a single price. Traditional explanations for why retailers forgo the opportunity to price discriminate focus on the cost of discriminating, including operational costs, explicit discrimination costs, and implicit discrimination costs. In this paper we identify an additional reason for why firms may forgo an opportunity to price discriminate. By revealing that a product is being sold to a broad range of segments, a retailer implicitly claims that the product is suitable for each segment. However, claiming that a premium-quality product is suitable for price-sensitive consumers undermines the credibility of a retailer's quality claim.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.20.3.315.9763","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on pricing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This manuscript proposes a new latent structure spatial model for the representation of market information that meets this requirement. When applied to a priori defined (e.g., socioeconomic) segments, our proposed methodology provides a new way to display marketing data parsimoniously via dimension reduction through a factor-analytic specification. In post hoc studies, we simultaneously derive market segments from the data and represent the structure of market information within each of the unobserved, derived groups/segments. We summarize all relevant information concerning derived market segments via a series of maps that prove conducive to the quick and accurate dissemination of customer and competitor market information. The associations between the variables are captured in a reduced space, where each variable is represented by a vector that emanates from the origin and terminates on a hypersphere of unit (the vector length is arbitrary) radius (e.g., a unit circle in a two-dimensional space). The angles between the variable vectors capture the correlation structure in the reduced space. The method is very general and can be utilized to identify latent structures in a wide range of marketing applications. We present an actual commercial marketing application involving the (normalized) prescription shares (of specialists) of ethical drugs to demonstrate the effectiveness of representing market information in this manner and to reveal the advantage of the proposed methodology over a more general finite mixture-based method. The proposed methodology derives three segments that tend to group specialists with respect to the stage of adoption of innovation in this therapeutic category. The specialists in the first group appear to be laggards because they prescribe more of the older class of brands. However, they also have a higher-than-average preference for a newer and somewhat cheaper brand. This suggests that some of the specialists belonging to this segment may be price sensitive, while others may exhibit a slower adoption cycle, replacing the older class with the newer brands, and thus, skip one stage in the cycle of innovation. The specialists in the second segment are heavy users of the newer class of brands but are not particularly fast to adopt the latest brands. Finally, the last segment clearly consists of innovators. Traditionally, pharmaceutical marketers have viewed specialists in one of two extremes\u2014all specialists are the same (i.e., the market has only one segment) or all specialists are very different (i.e., the market consists of 10,000+ segments of one physician each). Not surprisingly, this analysis suggests a more moderate perspective: specialists adopt new products at different rates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.20.4.426.9759","","MKS","Marketing","2","['market segments', 'socioeconomic', 'ethical drugs']","The article discusses market segmentation and the representation of market information, with a mention of socioeconomic segments and ethical drugs.

This flexible process is characterized by the ability to generate and respond to new information for a longer proportion of a development cycle. The constructs that support such a process are greater investments in architectural design, earlier feedback on product performance from the market, and the use of a development team with greater amounts of \u201cgenerational\u201d experience. Our results suggest that investments in architectural design play a dual role in a flexible process: First, through the need to select an architecture that maximizes product performance and, second, through the need to select an architecture that facilitates development process flexibility.

Data from a cross-sectional sample of 120 completed development projects for assembled goods is analyzed via a two-stage hierarchical moderated regression approach. The findings show that: (1) the organizational process factors studied are associated with achievement of operational outcome targets for product quality, unit cost, and time-to-market; (2) achievement of operational outcomes aids the achievement of market outcomes, in turn suggesting that development capabilities are indeed valuable firm resources; and (3) these relationships are robust under conditions of technological, market, and environmental uncertainty.

We model the contracting relationship between a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is privately informed about the outcome of his design/production investment. The buyer both appraises the supplier's component and does further processing/component production of his own. If the final product produced by the buyer exhibits decoupling and no function sharing with respect to the components (termed separable architecture), the first-best outcome is attained if both internal and external failures are contractible. When only one type of failure can be contracted on, we derive conditions under which contracting on internal failure is superior to contracting on external failure, and vice versa. If the buyer's final product has a nonseparable architecture with respect to the components, first-best cannot be achieved even if both internal and external failures are contractible. The value of contracting on internal failure alone is unaffected by the architecture design, while that of external failure declines relative to the separable setting; the net result is often to make the former the uniformly dominant performance metric. Our results highlight the interaction between the performance metrics used for contracting within the supply chain, the architecture of the product produced by the supply chain, and the incentive efficiency of the chain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.1.173.10673","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance and contracting relationships without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we connect these two important decisions and study them jointly. We use the property rights approach to argue that complexity in product design and vertical integration of production are complements: that in-house production is more attractive when product complexity is high, as firms seek to capture the benefits of their investment in the skills needed to coordinate development of complex designs. We test this hypothesis with a simultaneous equations model applied to data from the luxury-performance segment of the auto industry.

We present a cross-functional approach to evaluating multiple line extensions that simultaneously considers revenue implications of component sharing at the product level and cost implications at the component level. We develop a source-of-volume model and a measurement procedure to decompose the life-cycle sales volume from a line extension into sales from cannibalization, competitive draw, and demand expansion. We develop an activity-based costing procedure for estimating the life-cycle costs of line extensions that share components. We develop an optimization model that uses these revenue and cost estimates to identify a subset of line extensions that maximizes incremental profits. We implement our approach at a quartz wristwatch manufacturer. Results suggest that our approach would have improved profits for the firm by over 5%, while actually launching fewer line extensions. We also find that the drivers of cannibalization are counterintuitive. In simulation studies, our approach outperforms three managerial heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach is most valuable when cannibalization dominates competitive draw as a source of volume, and discuss its relative merits under low and high parts-sharing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.1.22.10667","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product line extensions, cost interactions, and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our model considers two distinct segments of consumers. Some of the implications of our analysis are not readily apparent. For example, when the high-quality component is made common, the average quality of the products offered to the two segments increases. One may infer that with higher average quality, higher prices or higher total revenues might ensue. However, this may not be the case, as detailed in the paper.

Product platforms, which are component and subsystem assets shared across a product-family, enable a firm to better leverage investments in product design and development. While the platform approach offers a number of benefits, it also imposes certain additional costs that have not received adequate research attention. In this paper, we use an industrial example both to illustrate some of the costs and benefits of platform-based product development and to motivate the development of a mathematical model. The model is formulated to better understand the appropriateness of product platforms and their impact on product-planning decisions. Our results indicate that platforms are not appropriate for extreme levels of market diversity or high levels of nonplatform scale economies. Also, a firm's product positioning and introduction sequence decisions made during the product-planning phase are significantly impacted by the presence of platforms. Specifically, a platform increases the separation among products and offers a multitude of product introduction strategies.

This value is now well accepted and referred to as \u201creal option value.\u201d We introduce, in addition to the familiar real option of abandonment, the option of corrective action that management can take during the project. The intuition from options pricing theory is that higher uncertainty in project payoffs increases the real option value of managerial decision flexibility.

We identify five example types of R\u2026D uncertainty, in market payoffs, project budgets, product performance, market requirements, and project schedules.

We find that if uncertainty is resolved or costs/revenues occur after all decisions have been made, more variability may \u201csmear out\u201d contingencies and thus reduce the value of flexibility. In addition, variability may reduce the probability of flexibility ever being exercised, which also reduces its value. This result runs counter to established option pricing theory intuition and contributes to a better risk management in R\u2026D projects. Our model builds intuition for R\u2026D managers as to when it is and when it is not worthwhile to delay commitments\u2014for example, by postponing a design freeze, thus maintaining flexibility in R\u2026D projects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.1.85.10661","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management and risk evaluation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In our first model, called local forecasting, each member updates the forecasts of future demands periodically, and is able to integrate the adjusted forecasts into his replenishment process. Forecast adjustments made at both levels of the supply chain can be correlated. The supply chain has a decentralized information structure, so that day-to-day inventory and forecast information are known locally only. In our second model, named collaborative forecasting, the supply chain members jointly maintain and update a single forecasting process in the system. Hence, forecasting information becomes centralized. Finally, we consider as a benchmark the special case in which forecasts are not integrated into the replenishment processes at all. We propose a unified framework that allows us to study and compare the three types of settings. This study comes at a time when various types of collaborative forecasting partnerships are being experimented within industry, and when the drivers for success or failure of such initiatives are not yet fully understood. In addition to providing some managerial insights into questions that arise in this context, our set of models is tailored to serve as building blocks for future work in this emerging area of research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.10.1326.10260","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain forecasting without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For certain types of parts, employing transshipments can significantly reduce the total inventory needed throughout the entire collection of stocking points. The study is motivated by a real-life situation involving a large utility company having 29 power-generating plants in five Southeastern states where there are thousands of parts that are commonly used at multiple plants. At present, each plant operates independently and maintains enough stock to meet its own requirements. Transshipments take place between plants whenever there is an emergency requirement for a part, but no explicit consideration is given to this effect while deciding on stocking levels at different plants. In the case we examined, by setting stocking levels to explicitly take account of transshipments, total system cost could be reduced by about 70% over the company's decentralized policy. In general, this work considers a single-echelon, N-location, continuous-review inventory system in which complete pooling of stock is permitted among the locations. A model is developed for slow-moving, expensive, and consumable parts that are common to two or more locations. A one-for-one ordering policy and queueing theory allow development and solution of a system of equations for the probability distribution of net inventory at each location. A heuristic procedure is also developed to determine cost-effective stocking levels. Actual data from the utility company are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Savings achieved as a result of pooling are reported.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.10.1371.10263","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost reduction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed, then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but it can be delivered later at the expense of a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real-life applications, the customer offers a grace period\u2014we call it a demand time window\u2014during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an acceptable earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window. This paper studies the dynamic lot-sizing problem with demand time windows and provides polynomial time algorithms for computing its solution. If backlogging is not allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T2) where T is the length of the planning horizon. When backlogging is allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T3).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.10.1384","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical mathematical model related to lot-sizing and demand time windows without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We discuss three applications where such a symmetry arises: a telecommunications network design problem, a noise pollution problem, and a machine procurement and operation problem. For each case, we identify the indistinguishable objects in the model that create the problem symmetry and show how imposing certain decision hierarchies within the model significantly enhances its solvability, while using a popular modern-day commercial branch-and-cut software (CPLEX 6.5).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.10.1396.10265","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of discrete optimization problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We show that when the service rates depend only on either the server or the station (and not both), then all nonidling server assignment policies are optimal. Moreover, for a Markovian system with two stations in tandem and two servers, we show that the optimal policy assigns one server to each station unless that station is blocked or starved (in which case the server helps at the other station), and we specify the criterion used for assigning servers to stations. Finally, we propose a simple server assignment policy for tandem systems in which the number of stations equals the number of servers, and we present numerical results that show that our policy appears to yield near-optimal throughput under general conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.10.1421.10262","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of server assignment policies and throughput optimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

In doing so, they can leverage the cumulative experience gained from serving their customer base to either reduce their variable costs or increase the quality of their products/services. In other words, their \u201cproduction technology\u201d exhibits some form of increasing returns to scale. Growth and globalization, coupled with recent advances in information technology, have led many of these firms to introduce sophisticated knowledge management (KM) systems in order to create sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, the authors analyze how KM is likely to affect competition among such professional services firms. In particular, they first explore what type (supply-side versus demand-side) of economies of scale are likely to be exploited in KM systems. In the former case, KM's role is to reduce the operating costs of the firm, while in the latter case, its role is to create added value to customers by significantly increasing product quality. Second, the authors analyze the competitive dynamics and market structure that emerge as a result of firms competing with KM systems. The results shed light on the current literature exploring the deployment of KM systems by suggesting that in a competitive setting, when firms' ability to leverage their customer base is high, KM should lead to quality improvement rather than cost reductions. In a dynamic setting, it is also shown that when firms use their KM system to improve product quality, higher ability to leverage the customer base may actually hurt profits and lead to industry shakeout. Beyond normative insights, the results also support a number of recent market trends in management consulting, including the increased emphasis on knowledge-creating activities in modern KM systems, the wave of mergers between consulting firms, and the recent emergence of \u201cretail consulting\u201d services.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1441.10249","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['knowledge management', 'competitive advantage', 'sustainable']","The article primarily focuses on knowledge management and competitive advantage without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

While prior research in the auditing literature has recognized the applicability of a Bayesian belief revision framework for many audit tasks, empirical evidence has suggested that auditors' cognitive decision processes often violate probability axioms. We believe that some of the well-documented cognitive limitations of a human auditor can be compensated by an automated system. In particular, we demonstrate that a formal belief revision scheme can be incorporated into an automated system to provide reliable probability estimates for early warning of bank failures. The automated system examines financial ratios as predictors of a bank's performance and assesses the posterior probability of a banks financial health (alternatively, financial distress). We examine two different probabilistic models, one that is simpler and makes more assumptions, while the other that is somewhat more complex but makes fewer assumptions. We find that both models are able to make accurate predictions with the help of historical data to estimate the required probabilities. In particular, the more complex model is found to be very well calibrated in its probability estimates. We posit that such a model can serve as a useful decision aid to an auditor's judgment process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1457.10253","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of probabilistic models for predicting bank failures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, analyses of discrete analogs have suggested that S-shaped response (convexity for low expenditure levels) may allow for the periodic optima encountered in actual practice. Casting the dynamic between advertising and sales in a common format (an autonomous, first-order relationship), the present paper explores extensions along three dimensions: an S-shaped response function, the value of the discount rate, and the possibility of diffusion-like response. Supplementing the treatment by Mahajan and Muller (1986), a flexible class of S-shaped response models is formulated for which it is demonstrated that, in contrast to findings in the literature on discretized advertising models, continuous periodic optima cannot be supported. Further, a set of conditions on the advertising response function are derived, that contains and extends that suggested by Sasieni (1971). Collectively, these results both suggest a set of baseline properties that reasonable models should possess and cast doubt on the ability of first-order models to capture effects of known managerial relevance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1476.10246","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising models without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity themes.

The authors extend the classic newsvendor model by assuming that expected utility maximizing consumers choose between visiting the firm and consuming an exogenous outside option. The outside option represents the utility the consumer forgoes when she chooses to visit the firm before knowing whether or not the product will be available. The authors investigate both the case in which the firm's price is exogenous and the case in which price is chosen optimally. The paper makes two contributions. First, the authors show that the firm holds more inventories, provides a higher fill rate, attracts more customers, and earns higher profits when it internalizes the effect of its inventory on demand. Second, the authors show that in the endogenous price case the firm's two-dimensional decision problem can be reduced to two, sequential, single-variable optimizations. As a result, the endogenous-price case is as easy to solve as the exogenous-price case.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1488.10252","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Traditionally, decision analysis assumes expected utility not only for the prescriptive purpose of calculating optimal decisions but also for the descriptive purpose of eliciting utilities. However, descriptive violations of expected utility bias utility elicitations. That such biases are effective became clear when systematic discrepancies were found between different utility elicitation methods that, under expected utility, should have yielded identical utilities. As it is not clear how to correct for these biases without further knowledge of their size or nature, most utility elicitations still calculate utilities by means of the expected utility formula. This paper speculates on the biases and their sizes by using the quantitative assessments of probability transformation and loss aversion suggested by prospect theory. It presents quantitative corrections for the probability and certainty equivalence methods. If interactive sessions to correct for biases are not possible, then the authors propose to use the corrected utilities rather than the uncorrected ones in prescriptions of optimal decisions. In an experiment, the discrepancies between the probability and certainty equivalence methods are removed by the authors' proposal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1498.10248","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modifications to utility elicitation methods without any mention of social themes, ethics, or equity.

The solution concept is Markov-perfect equilibria with general equilibria embedded in every time period. Our model is flexible enough to simultaneously explain or accommodate many commonly observed phenomena or stylized facts, such as concurrent leasing and selling, active secondary markets for used goods, heterogeneous consumers, endogenous consumption patterns, depreciation, an infinite time horizon, and nontrivial transaction costs. Within our model, consumers have incentives to segment themselves into various consumption classes according to their willingness to pay, and nontrivial transaction costs to sell used goods put strong constraints on consumers' consumption sequences in time. As a direct consequence of the finite durability, the market power of the monopolist remains intact. Leasing manifests itself as a facilitator of price discrimination by debundling the durable good into new and used portions that are naturally bundled together under outright sales. The concurrent leasing and selling reflects the degree of the comparative advantage the monopolist has over consumers in disposing used goods. This comparative advantage, which is partially exploited by the monopolist and partially shared by the consumers, provides a sufficient mechanism to gain Pareto improvement on the market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1515.10250","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical economic model regarding monopolies and transaction costs without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2001","47","11","Jack P.

The model incorporates (1) congestion and delay through uncertainties in demand and processing times, (2) a changing production cost environment through uncertainty in an environmental state (such as the exchange rate), and (3) allowing production to stock. The main contribution of the paper is to characterize the optimal production policy, assuming no switchover cost, as a barrier-type control policy for a series of models. For each plant, there is a barrier function defined on the environmental state that gives the total worldwide stock level barrier: This plant should be operated if and only if the stock level is below this barrier. The authors also show that, in a simple setting of two plants in different countries, the barrier functions are not always monotone in the exchange rate even when the production costs are. The authors present a condition under which the control barriers are shown to be monotone. Under this condition and with only two plants, it is optimal to follow a primary/secondary plant policy in which, given a fixed environmental state, it is optimal to operate both plants when stock is low, only the primary plant when stock is moderate, and neither when stock is high.

We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights\u2014increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase in set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity.

Variety imposes two types of costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product mark-down costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, and the costs of lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact of variety on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some types of variety incur high production costs and some types of variety incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i.e., high-volume firms) will offer types of variety associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer types of variety associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the type of product variety they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.12.1588.10237","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and firm performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A unique aspect of this study is that a distribution of learning/forgetting behavior based on an empirical population of workers is used rather than assuming the same learning pattern for all employees. The paper demonstrates that modeling only central tendency and not the variations across workers tends to systematically underestimate overall productivity. The data used to estimate the parameters for the distribution of learning curves were collected from an assembly line that produces car radios. Analysis of the models fit to a population of workers reveals that higher levels of previous experience are positively correlated with higher steady-state productivity levels and negatively correlated with the learning rate. To further motivate the study, a conceptual model with several factors hypothesized to influence assembly line productivity is presented. Among key factors included in the model are the rate of worker learning, the size of the worker pool, task tenure, and the magnitude of worker forgetting. In controlled computer simulation experiments, each of these factors was found to be statistically significant, as were a number of the two-way interaction terms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.12.1639.10236","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['heterogeneity', 'worker learning', 'productivity']","The article discusses worker heterogeneity and learning patterns, which touch on aspects of workforce diversity and individual differences.

A client and contractor enter into an agreement for a project either by bidding or negotiation. Effective and efficient bidding, negotiation, and subsequent monitoring are hindered by the lack of appropriate decision support tools for the management of project finances. Progress payments to the contractor are an important issue in project management because of their potential impact on project finances and activity schedules. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously determining the amount, location, and timing of progress payments in projects from a client's perspective. We develop three mixed-integer linear programming models, based on some practical methods of determining payment schedules from different types of project contracts. We discuss properties of the models and draw insights about the characteristics of optimal payment schedules obtained with each model by an experimental study on a sample of 10 small projects. Our analysis shows that, contrary to current practice, the client obtains the greatest benefit by scheduling the project for early completion such that the payments are not made at regular intervals. It is also cost effective for the client to make payments either in the early stages of the project or toward the end, even though this causes considerable variation in the time gap between payments. We also evaluate the impact of the client's preferred payment schedules on the contractor's finances and activity schedules, and draw some conclusions on the interdependence of payment and project parameters on the objectives of both parties entering the contractual agreement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.12.1654.10242","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management and payment scheduling without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or diversity themes.

We extend the two-stage approach by allowing the probability weighting function to depend on the type of uncertainty. Using this more general approach, properties of decision weights can be attributed to properties of probability judgments and/or to properties of probability weighting.

If the uncertainties are expressed in terms of multivariate continuous distributions, or a discrete distribution with far too many outcomes, we normally face two possibilities: either creating a decision model with internal sampling, or trying to find a simple discrete approximation of the given distribution that serves as input to the model. This paper presents a method based on nonlinear programming that can be used to generate a limited number of discrete outcomes that satisfy specified statistical properties. Users are free to specify any statistical properties they find relevant, and the method can handle inconsistencies in the specifications. The basic idea is to minimize some measure of distance between the statistical properties of the generated outcomes and the specified properties.

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that treats testing as an activity that generates information about technical and customer-need related problems. An analysis of the model results in several important findings. First, optimal testing strategies need to balance the tension between several variables, including the increasing cost of redesign, the cost of a test as function of fidelity, and the correlation between sequential tests. Second, a simple form of our model results in an EOQ-like result: The optimal number of tests (called the Economic Testing Frequency or ETF) is the square root of the ratio of avoidable cost and the cost of a test. Third, the relationship between sequential tests can have an impact on optimal testing strategies. If sequential tests are increasing refinements of one another, managers should invest their budgets in a few high-fidelity tests, whereas if the tests identify problems independently of one another it may be more effective if developers carry out a higher number of lower-fidelity tests. Using examples, the implications for managerial practice are discussed and suggestions for further research undertakings are provided.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.2.308.9838","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and testing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Almost as mad is the plethora of office pools across the country where the object is to pick a priori as many game winners as possible in the tournament. More generally, the object in an office pool is to maximize total pool points, where different points are awarded for different correct winning predictions. We consider the structure of single elimination tournaments, and show how to efficiently calculate the mean and the variance of the number of correctly predicted wins (or more generally the total points earned in an office pool) for a given slate of predicted winners. We apply these results to both random and Markov tournaments. We then show how to determine optimal office pool predictions that maximize the expected number of points earned in the pool. Considering various Markov probability models for predicting game winners based on regular season performance, professional sports rankings, and Las Vegas betting odds, we compare our predictions with what actually happened in past NCAA and NIT tournaments. These models perform similarly, achieving overall prediction accuracies of about 58%, but do not surpass the simple strategy of picking the seeds when the goal is to pick as many game winners as possible.

From a theoretical perspective, a traditional distinction between radical and incremental innovation has often been used in the literature of innovation, and has created the basis for many classical contingency studies. Similar concepts, however, did not become standard in the literature of projects, and it seems that theory development in project management is still in its early years. As a result, most project management literature still assumes that all projects are fundamentally similar and that \u201cone size fits all.\u201d The purpose of this exploratory research is to show how different types of projects are managed in different ways, and to explore the domain of traditional contingency theory in the more modern world of projects. This two-step research is using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and two data sets to suggest a conceptual, two-dimensional construct model for the classification of technical projects and for the investigation of project contingencies. Within this framework, projects are classified into four levels of technological uncertainty, and into three levels of system complexity, according to a hierarchy of systems and subsystems. The study provides two types of implications. For project leadership it shows why and how management should adapt a more project-specific style. For theory development, it offers a collection of insights that seem relevant to the world of projects as temporary organizations, but are, at times, different from classical structural contingency theory paradigms in enduring organizations. While still exploratory in nature, this study attempts to suggest new inroads to the future study of modern project domains.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.3.394.9772","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['contingency', 'innovation', 'management']","The article primarily focuses on project management and theoretical frameworks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Regular orders are placed periodically following a base stock policy on inventory position, and arrive at the stocking location after a deterministic lead time. The location also has the option of placing emergency orders, characterized by a shorter lead time but higher acquisition cost, in case of imminent stockouts. Thus, at some appropriate time in the replenishment cycle, the necessity and size of an emergency order is determined according to a base stock policy on net stock. The timing of the emergency order is such that this order arrives and can be used to satisfy the demand in the time period just before the arrival of a regular order, when the likelihood of a stockout is highest. An approximate cost model is developed which can easily be optimized with respect to the order-up-to parameters. This model is used as the basis for a heuristic algorithm, which leads to solutions that are very close to the exact optimal solutions determined through simulation. It is shown that the proposed system offers substantial cost savings relative to a system without the emergency replenishment option.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.3.415.9770","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical inventory management system without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The view holds that hierarchical managers perform two roles that create value for firms in perpetuity\u2014an administrative role of enforcing operational routine, and an entrepreneurial role of executing a metaroutine that continually revises operational routine to keep pace with changes in the environment. The test consists of a natural experiment comparing the behavior and performance of establishments that leave a franchise, \u201close their hierarchical managers,\u201d with those that remain. I find support for the view. In the absence of the franchisor, establishment behavior drifts from the operational routine, and establishments fail to adopt innovation.

Thus hierarchical managers are necessary to actively enforce routine, even after the routine been assimilated, and to introduce innovation, even in this unique setting of perfect incentives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.3.430.9776","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of hierarchy and operational routines without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In two numerical experiments designed so that optimal policies could be computed, the LP policy fared well, differing from the optimal profit by an average of 2.20% and 1.84%, respectively.

The design scope dimension characterizes the type of problem-solving activities outsourced by the manufacturer. The level of task interdependency dimension characterizes the influence of any given supplier-manufacturer interaction on other activities within an overall innovation process. Data analyses on 50 supplier-manufacturer relationships drawn from three new product development projects show that the type of problem-solving activities being partitioned and their level of interdependency with the rest of the project are important predictors of performance outcomes of the relationship, controlling for contractual differences. Further, the analyses demonstrate a clear trade-off between short-term efficiency-increasing and longer-term learning-enhancing outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.4.493.9828","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['efficiency', 'learning', 'interorganizational']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of interorganizational relationships and performance outcomes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Despite its importance, sampling remains one of the most under-researched areas. There are no theoretical quantitative models of sampling behavior other than the pioneering work of Jain et al. (1995), who modeled sampling as an important factor in the diffusion of new products. In this paper we characterize sampling as having two effects. The first is the change in the probability of a consumer purchasing a product immediately after having sampled the product. The second is an increase in the consumer's cumulative goodwill formation, which results from sampling the product. This distinction differentiates our model from other models of goodwill, in which firm sales are only a function of the existing goodwill level. We determine the optimal dynamic sampling effort of a firm and examine the factors that affect the sampling decision. We find that although the sampling effort will decline over a product's life cycle, it may continue in mature products. Another finding is that when we have a positive change in the factors that increase sampling productivity, steady-state goodwill stock and sales will increase, but equilibrium sampling can either increase or decrease. The change in the sampling level is indeterminate because, while increased sampling productivity means that firms have incentives to increase sampling, the increase in the equilibrium goodwill level indirectly reduces the marginal productivity of sampling, thus reducing the incentives to sample. We discuss managerial implications, and how the model can be used to address various circumstances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.4.532.9832","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of product sampling behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This Markov chain has an \u201cattractor state,\u201d i.e., from any state of the Markov chain there exists a sample path of significant probability to the attractor state. There also exists a \u201crare set,\u201d which is accessible from the attractor state only by sample paths of very small probability. The problem is to estimate the probability that starting from the attractor state, the Markov chain hits the rare set before returning to the attractor state. Examples of this setting arise in the case of reliability models with highly reliable components as well as in the case of queueing networks with low traffic. Importance-sampling is a commonly used simulation technique for the fast estimation of rare-event probabilities. It involves simulating the Markov chain under a new probability measure that emphasizes the most likely paths to the rare set. Previous research focused on developing importance-sampling schemes for a special case of Markov chains that did not include \u201chigh-probability cycles.\u201d We show through examples that the Markov chains used to model many commonly encountered systems do have high-probability cycles, and existing importance-sampling schemes can lead to infinite variance in simulating such systems. We then develop the insight that in the presence of high-probability cycles care should be taken in allocating the new transition probabilities so that the variance accumulated over these cycles does not increase without bounds. Based on this observation we develop two importance-sampling techniques that have the bounded relative error property, i.e., the simulation run-length required to estimate the rare-event probability to a fixed degree of accuracy remains bounded as the event of interest becomes more rare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.4.547.9827","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Markov chains and simulation techniques without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We then extend these two sets of models to examine the impact of individual prevention activities and past nonconformance expenditures on defect rates. We find that benefits from different types of prevention expenditures vary, and that past nonconformance expenditures provide learning opportunities that allow the organization to more efficiently cope with future failures, thereby reducing subsequent nonconformance costs.

We investigate these benefits in the context of a supply chain in which a manufacturer supplies expensive, low-demand items to vertically integrated or autonomous retailers via one central depot. The manufacturer's lead time is assumed to be due to the geographical distance from the market or a combination of low volumes, high variety, and inflexible production processes. We formulate and solve an appropriate mathematical model based on one-for-one inventory policies in which a replenishment order is placed as soon as the customer withdraws an item. We find that sharing and transshipment of items often, but not always, reduces the overall costs of holding, shipping, and waiting for inventory.

The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract, the supplier constructs capacity (if he accepts the contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.5.629.10486","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract compliance without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We derive the optimal testing strategy as a function of testing cost, prior knowledge, and testing lead time. Using information theory to measure the test efficiency, we further show that in the case of imperfect testing (due to noise or simulated test conditions), the attractiveness of parallel strategies decreases.

This is done because forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly for longer horizons, while computational burden increases. However, what is optimal over the short horizon may be suboptimal over the long run, resulting in errors known as end-effects. A common end-effect in lot-sizing models is to set end-of-horizon inventory to zero. This policy can result in excessive setup costs or stock-outs in the long run. We present a method to mitigate end-effects in lot sizing by including a valuation term V(IT) for end-of-horizon inventory IT, in the objective function of the short-horizon model. We develop this concept within the classical EOQ modeling framework, and then apply it to the dynamic lot-sizing problem (DLSP). If demand in each period of the DLSP equals the long-run average demand rate, then our procedure induces an optimal ordering policy over the short horizon that coincides with the long-run optimal ordering policy. We test our procedure empirically against the Wagner-Whitin algorithm and the Silver Meal heuristic, under several demand patterns, within a rolling horizon framework. With few exceptions, our approach significantly outperforms the other approaches tested, for modest to long model horizons. We discuss applicability to more general lot-sizing problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.5.679.10485","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory valuation and production scheduling without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Specifically, this paper studies a distribution channel where a supplier distributes a single product to retailers, who in turn sell the product to consumers. The demand in each retail market arrives continuously at a constant rate that is a general decreasing function of the retail price in the market. We have characterized an optimal strategy, maximizing total systemwide profits in a centralized system. We have also shown that the same optimum level of channelwide profits can be achieved in a decentralized system, but only if coordination is achieved via periodically charged, fixed fees, and a nontraditional discount pricing scheme under which the discount given to a retailer is the sum of three discount components based on the retailer's (i) annual sales volume, (ii) order quantity, and (iii) order frequency, respectively. Moreover, we show that no (traditional) discount scheme, based on order quantities only, suffices to optimize channelwide profits when there are multiple nonidentical retailers. The paper also considers a scenario where the channel members fail to coordinate their decisions and provides numerical examples that illustrate the value of coordination.

We show that when a full-price rebate is not possible and the producer and the supplier have to share the damage costs, an optimal contract is such that the supplier compensates the producer by the same amount, regardless of his quality type. However, a supplier with low quality is more likely to be offered a contract with an inspection scheme, while a supplier with high quality is constrained with a warranty scheme. We also show that when the producer need not share the cost in exactly one of the compensation schemes, he may still offer the other compensation scheme to a supplier type depending on the relative costs involved, the maximum compensation cost acceptable by all supplier types, and his ex ante beliefs about the quality level of the supplier.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.5.709.10479","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of contract design and quality control in producer-supplier relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our formal analysis of the difference in aggregated and segregated portfolio evaluation demonstrates that the higher attractiveness of the aggregated presentation mode is not a general phenomenon (as suggested in the literature) but depends on specific parameters of the lotteries.

A dynamic principal-agent model that captures the interaction between the two parties is developed. In this model, patients arrive exogenously, receive periodic treatment from the provider, suffer costly complications that require hospital care, and eventually exit the system in death. The provider chooses the intensity of treatment in each period, incurs an associated cost, and is reimbursed by the purchaser according to observed patient outcomes. The purchaser's problem is to determine a payment system that will induce treatment choices maximizing total social welfare. The optimal payment system, referred to as the outcomes-adjusted payment system, is identified. It consists of a prospective payment per patient and a retrospective payment adjustment based on adverse short-term patient outcomes. This system induces the most efficient delivery of medical services by combining the immediate \u201cthreat\u201d of a retrospective payment adjustment with the future reward of prospective payments generated by surviving patients. A numerical example is provided in the context of Medicare's End-Stage Renal Disease program. The example compares the optimal system to systems that are currently in place. The results suggest that the purchaser can achieve significant gains in patient life expectancy by switching to the outcomes-adjusted payment system, but this requires accurate information about treatment technology, patient characteristics, and provider preferences.

Because the success of such horizontal alliances depends crucially on aligning individual alliance-member incentives with those of the alliance as a whole, it is important to find coordination mechanisms that achieve this alignment and are simple-to-implement. In this paper, we examine two simple coordination mechanisms for a horizontal alliance characterized by the following features: (i) firms in the alliance can exert effort only in their \u201clocal\u201d markets to increase customer demand for the alliance; (ii) customers are mobile and a customer living in a given alliance member's local area may have a need to buy from some other alliance member; and (iii) the coordination rules followed by the alliance determine which firms from a large pool of potential member-firms join the alliance, and how much effort each firm joining the alliance exerts in its local market. In this horizontal alliance setup, we consider the use of two coordination mechanisms: (i) a linear transfer of fees between members if demand from one member's local customer is served by another member, and (ii) ownership of an equal share of the alliance profits generated from a royalty on each member's sales. We derive conditions on the distribution of demand externalities among alliance members to determine when each coordination mechanism should be used separately, and when the mechanisms should be used together.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.6.787.9808","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['horizontal alliances', 'coordination mechanisms', 'incentives', 'externalities']","The article primarily focuses on technical mechanisms for coordinating business alliances without any explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We give a 0-1 linear programming formulation based on binary variables associated with trip transitions, which applies to both crew and vehicle scheduling. The model is enhanced by means of new families of valid inequalities, for which exact and heuristic separation procedures are proposed. These techniques are embedded into an exact branch-and-cut algorithm, which also incorporates heuristic procedures. The performance of two implementations of the method (for vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling, respectively) are evaluated through computational testing on both random and real-world test problems from the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.6.833.9810","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of crew and vehicle scheduling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This production-planning problems allows multiple items to be produced within a time period, and setups for items to be carried over from one period to the next. Two interrelated decisions, sequencing and lot sizing, are present in this problem. Our tabu-search heuristic consists of five basic move types\u2014three for the sequencing decisions and two for the lot-sizing decisions. We allow infeasible solutions to be generated at a penalty during the course of the search. We use several search strategies, such as dynamic tabu list, adaptive memory, and self-adjusting penalties, to strengthen our heuristic. We also propose a lower-bounding procedure to estimate the quality of our heuristic solution. We have also modified our heuristic to produce good solutions for the CLSP without set-up carryover. The computational study, conducted on a set of 540 test problems, indicates that on average our heuristic solutions are within 12% of a bound on optimality. In addition, for the set of test problems our results indicate an 8% reduction in total cost through set-up carryover.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.6.851.9813","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in production planning without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Restrictions imposed on the cutting process make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex, but limit the scope of solution space. The objective of the problem is mainly to minimize waste, but our model also accounts for other issues such as aging stock pieces, urgent or optional orders, and fixed setup costs.

LP-based lower bounds on the minimum cost are computed and, by rounding the LP solution, a feasible solution and associated upper bound is obtained.

Previous works on the subject mainly concentrate on 2- and 3-dimensional tables whose entries are subject to marginal totals. In this paper we address the problem of protecting sensitive data in a statistical table whose entries are linked by a generic system of linear constraints. This very general setting covers, among others, k-dimensional tables with marginals as well as the so-called hierarchical and linked tables that are very often used nowadays for disseminating statistical data. In particular, we address the optimization problem known in the literature as the (secondary) Cell Suppression Problem, in which the information loss due to suppression has to be minimized. We introduce a new integer linear programming model and outline an enumerative algorithm for its exact solution. The algorithm can also be used as a heuristic procedure to find near-optimal solutions. Extensive computational results on a test-bed of 1,160 real-world and randomly generated instances are presented, showing the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, we were able to solve to proven optimality 4-dimensional tables with marginals as well as linked tables of reasonable size (to our knowledge, tables of this kind were never solved optimally by previous authors).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.7.1008.9805","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to data protection without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For any such \u201cindirect\u201d materials, an inescapable incentive conflict exists: The buyer wishes to minimize consumption of these indirect materials, while the supplier's profits depend on increasing volume. Both buyer and supplier can exert effort to reduce consumption, hence making the overall supply chain more efficient. However, no supplier will voluntarily participate unless contract terms are fundamentally revised. This can be done through a variety of \u201cshared-savings\u201d contracts, where both parties profit from a consumption reduction. This paper analyzes several such contracts currently in use for chemicals purchasing. We show that such contracts can always increase supply-chain profits but need not lead to reduced consumption. We analyze equilibrium effort levels, consumption, and total profits, and show how these change with the contract parameters. We find that the goals of maximizing joint profits and minimizing consumption are generally not aligned. Also, surprisingly, a decrease in a cost parameter can lead to a decrease in profits; it may be necessary (but is always possible) to renegotiate the shared-savings contract to reap the benefits of a cost decrease.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.7.881.9802","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['environmental impacts', 'consumption reduction', 'supply chain', 'efficiency']","The article discusses the environmental impacts of supply chain practices and the need for consumption reduction, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical considerations in business operations.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index for services fell in 2000 to 69.4%, down 5 percentage points from 1994. We hypothesize that the characteristics of services\u2014inseparability, intangibility, and labor intensity\u2014interact with management practices to bias service providers toward reducing the level of service they deliver, often locking entire industries into a vicious cycle of eroding service standards. To explore this proposition we develop a formal model that integrates the structural elements of service delivery. We use econometric estimation, interviews, observations, and archival data to calibrate the model for a consumer-lending service center in a major bank in the United Kingdom. We find that temporary imbalances between service capacity and demand interact with decision rules for effort allocation, capacity management, overtime, and quality aspirations to yield permanent erosion of the service standards and loss of revenue.

The customer classes are characterized by different demand patterns, delay costs, and service costs. Customers make individual decisions on whether to join the queue and, if so, their service requirements. Their class identities and service requirements are private information not known to the system manager. We develop a two-stage decision framework to analyze the problem and characterize the optimal admission rates and service requirements under both centralized and decentralized assumptions. We distinguish admission and service externality costs that lead to suboptimal performance under decentralized control. For a given service discipline, we derive optimal class-specific pricing schemes that can coordinate the system when only service requirements but not class identities are unobservable. When customer class identities are also unobservable, we consider two common service disciplines that offer undifferentiated service: processor sharing and first-come-first-served. Based on the general framework, for the M/G/s processor sharing queue, we show that a single variable fee (payment per unit of time in the system) can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. For the M/G/1 first-come-first-served queue, we show that a single pricing scheme that is quadratic in time in service can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. Our result demonstrates that, under suitable conditions, simple and undifferentiated pricing can coordinate complex queueing systems with heterogeneous customer classes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.7.915.9806","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and pricing strategies without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A major determinant of the structure of supply chains is the cost structure associated with the underlying manufacturing process. In this paper, we examine the impact of fixed and variable costs on the structure and competitiveness of supply chains with a serial structure and price-sensitive linear deterministic demand. The entry stage is modeled as a simultaneous game, where the players take the outcomes of the subsequent post-entry (Cournot) competition into account in making their entry decisions. We derive expressions for prices and production quantities as functions of the number of entrants at each tier of a multitier chain. We characterize viability and stability of supply-chain structures and show, using lattice arguments, that there is always an equilibrium structure in pure strategies in the entry game. Finally, we examine the effects of vertical integration in the two-tier case. Altogether, the paper provides a framework for comparing a variety of supply-chain structures and for studying how they are affected by cost structures and by the number of entrants throughout the chain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.7.966.9799","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain structures and competitiveness without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As the broker observes demand for the item, she learns about the demand process. However, as is often the case in practice, it becomes either more difficult or more expensive to procure the item as the selling season advances. Thus, the broker must trade off higher procurement costs against the benefit of making ordering decisions with better information about demand. Problems of this type arise, for example, in the travel industry, where a travel agent's cost of procuring airline and hotel reservations increases as the date of a vacation package approaches.

We develop mathematical models of the interaction between firms and labor supply agencies when demand and supply are uncertain. We consider two models of labor supply uncertainty, termed productivity and availability uncertainty, and study how each affects the nature of the contracts formed. These models reflect two major roles played by the labor supply agency. In the case of productivity uncertainty we find that it is possible to construct a contract that coordinates the firm and agency hiring in an optimal way. In contrast, we show that in environments characterized by availability uncertainty, optimal contracts are not possible.

Among the strategies considered are exporting (EXP), joint ventures with local partners (JV), and wholly owned production facilities (WOS) in the foreign country. Our research takes a first step in modeling the influence of exchange rates on the choice and dynamic adjustment of such strategies. The insights obtained from our modeling analysis are then translated into testable hypotheses and empirically verified with the use of firm level data from U.S. multinational corporations (both at the firm and a more aggregate level). An insightful result of our model is the identification of a hysteresis phenomenon that characterizes switching behavior between strategies in the presence of switchover cost. The magnitude of the hysteresis band, which is a measure of the inertia associated with keeping the current ownership structure, is affected by a multiplicity of factors such as exchange rate volatility and market power of the entering firm. Analytical and numerical results on the effects of such factors on the hysteresis band are provided. The four testable hypotheses generated from our modeling analysis are rigorously tested with the use of a multinomial logit model on data obtained from the Harvard Multinational Enterprise database, and a data set maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Department of Commerce. The empirical results strongly support our insights that relatively depreciated real exchange rates (i.e., weak home currency) favor (a) the JV over the WOS and (b) EXP mode over the WOS or JV.

In the former situation, part of the demand is subcontracted while, in the latter, capacity that has been paid for is rendered idle. Capacity and subcontracting decisions arise in many economic activities ranging from production capacity planning in semiconductor fabs to leasing communication networks, from transportation contracts to staffing of call centers. In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between acquiring capacity, subcontracting, production, and holding inventory to satisfy nonstationary demand over a finite horizon. We present capacity acquisition models with holding and without holding inventory and identify forecast-robust properties of the models that restrict the dependence of optimal capacity decisions on the demand forecasts. We develop algorithms for numerous practical cost structures involving variable and fixed charges and prove that they all have polynomial time complexity. For models with inventory, we solve a sequence of constant capacity lot-sizing and subcontracting subproblems, which is also of independent interest.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.8.1081.10232","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity acquisition and subcontracting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We address problems where the process of deciding the inventory, and then realizing the demand, occurs repeatedly. The only information we use is the amount of inventory left over. Rather than attempting to estimate the demand distribution, we directly estimate the value function using a technique called the Concave, Adaptive Value Estimation (CAVE) algorithm. CAVE constructs a sequence of concave piecewise linear approximations using sample gradients of the recourse function at different points in the domain. Since it is a sampling-based method, CAVE does not require knowledge of the underlying sample distribution.

Each activity of this resource-constrained project-scheduling problem has certain resource requirements and a known deterministic cash flow that can be either positive or negative. Deterministic cash flows are assumed to occur over the duration of the activities. Progress payments and cash outflows occur at the completion of activities. The objective is to schedule the activities subject to a fixed deadline to maximize the net present value subject to the precedence and resource constraints. With these features the financial aspects of project management are taken into account.We introduce a depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm that makes use of extra precedence relations to resolve a number of resource conflicts and a fast recursive search algorithm for the max-npv problem to compute upper bounds. The recursive search algorithm exploits the idea that positive cash flows should be scheduled as early as possible while negative cash flows should be scheduled as late as possible within the precedence constraints. The procedure has been coded in Visual C++, Version 4.0 under Windows NT, and has been validated on two problem sets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.8.1113.10226","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of project scheduling and financial optimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Recently, a new simulation technique known as empirical martingale simulation (EMS) has been proposed by Duan and Simonato (1998) as a way of improving simulation accuracy. EMS has one drawback however. Because of the dependency among sample paths created by the EMS adjustment, the standard error of the price estimate is not readily available from using one simulation sample. In this paper, we develop a scheme to estimate the EMS accuracy. The EMS price estimator is first shown to have an asymptotically normal distribution. Through a simulation study, we then find that the asymptotic normal distribution serves as a good approximation for samples consisting of as few as 500 simulation paths.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.8.1122.10234","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical aspect of financial modeling without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

The procedures allow for screening and attempt to allocate additional replications to improve the value of information obtained during the second stage, rather than determining the number of replications required to provide a given probability of correct selection guarantee.

This paper presents a new double-auction mechanism to handle resource allocation for public goods when complementarity exists. The mechanism is placed in the context of an organization's internal knowledge investment. Knowledge goods have two distinct characteristics. First, knowledge within an organization can be considered a public good, so it is subject to the free-rider problem. Second, knowledge is interrelated and interdependent; that is, there is complementarity among knowledge components. The value of knowledge often derives from a bundle of knowledge components, rather than from its individual pieces. These two characteristics present a serious challenge to allocating organizational resources for knowledge goods. We introduce an internal market in which knowledge providers offer knowledge projects and knowledge consumers place bids to acquire them. The mechanism is a Groves-Clarke-type double auction that allows bundled knowledge goods to be traded so as to recognize complementarities between knowledge projects. The market mechanism we propose is incentive compatible; i.e., it induces people to reveal their true valuation. In addition, it allows trades of knowledge bundles to determine which knowledge components are most valuable from the organization's viewpoint. Under mild assumptions, the mechanism is a computationally tractable solution to operating a market of bundled public goods. We further show how \u201cimputed prices\u201d can be calculated for subsets of knowledge components and prove that a market mechanism that does not allow bundle orders or does not address the free-rider problem yields a systematic underinvestment in knowledge.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.9.1203.9781","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['public good', 'free-rider problem', 'resource allocation']","The article discusses knowledge as a public good and addresses the free-rider problem, which touches on ethical considerations in resource allocation.

Under declining retail prices, if the wholesale prices and the return rebates are set properly, then EM (i.e., midlife and end-of-life returns) achieves channel coordination. However, such a policy may not be implementable because it may require the manufacturer to be worse off as a result of coordination. If P is used in addition to EM and the terms are set properly, then PEM guarantees both coordination and a win-win outcome. If the retail price is constant over time, then EM is sufficient to guarantee both coordination and a win-win outcome.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.9.1220.9786","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of channel policies in pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem consists in simultaneously modifying, as necessary, the existing flight departure schedules and planned individual work days (duties) while keeping planned aircraft itineraries unchanged. It requires the covering of all flights from one day of operations with available pilots while minimizing changes in both the flight schedule and the next day's planned duties. The newly constructed personalized duties must not exceed the maximum duty duration. Flight precedence constraints, coming from existing fixed aircraft itineraries, must be respected as well. The problem is mathematically formulated as an integer nonlinear multicommodity network flow model with time windows and additional constraints. To solve the problem, a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition combined with a branch-and-bound method has been used. The master problem comprises the flight-covering constraints and a new set of flight precedence constraints. Subproblems consisting of time-constrained shortest-path problems with linear time costs are solved by a specialized dynamic-programming algorithm. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on several input data sets.

An Empirical Study","Numerous normative models have been developed to determine optimal inventory levels, and several articles and case studies have been written about the concerted efforts and practices adopted by manufacturing firms in the United States to reduce inventories. But little is known about whether inventories have indeed decreased in U.S. manufacturing and whether such a decrease has been restricted to a few well-publicized firms or is true at an industry level. Using data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the authors study trends in materials, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory ratios during the period 1961 to 1994 in 20 manufacturing industry sectors and the total U.S. manufacturing sector to determine whether a significant decrease was seen in these ratios. Further, since a great deal of momentum for inventory reduction began in the early 1980s, the authors investigate whether greater improvement was seen in the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period. We find that material and work-in-process inventories did decrease in a majority of the two-digit industry sectors from 1961 to 1994 and showed greater improvement in about half the sectors in the post-1980 period relative to the pre-1980 period. Finished-goods inventories did decrease in some industry sectors and increase in a few others but did not show a significant trend in more than half the sectors. Total manufacturing inventory ratios decreased from 1961 to 1994 at all three stages\u2014material, work-in-process, and finished goods. However, total manufacturing inventory ratios did not improve at a higher rate during the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period in any of the three stages.

We posit that the impact on manufacturing quality, measured as the defect rate trajectory, is monotonically nonincreasing over time and may, more specifically, assume the shape of an inverted S-curve. Employing a longitudinal research design, we investigate four work teams over a 28-month period in a field setting. Each team corresponds to one of the four interconnected production lines in an electromechanical assembly plant operated by a Fortune 500 firm.

We model the forecast of discrete demand as a band defined by the lower and upper bounds on demand, such that future forecasts lie within the current band. We develop a capacitated production planning model for a single product with terminal demand. We develop four heuristics for the problem and characterize their performance. In particular, two of the heuristics are optimal for the no holding-cost case. In our computational study, we analyze the performance of our heuristics and compare them to the optimal solution and to a simple heuristic that simulates common industrial practice using point forecasts. We find that two of our heuristics are very close to the optimal solution (less than 0.5% away from optimal on average under the conditions studied). Further, we consider forecast update patterns with primarily early, intermediate, and late information updates and provide insights on the effect of information update patterns on optimal costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.1.68.9999","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production planning and forecasting without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We model the physical scenario as one of constant displayed inventory level (on which demand rate depends positively) and continuous replenishment. With a single retailer, we show that to coordinate the channel and make a profit the manufacturer needs to augment the wholesale price lever by another-an inventory holding costs subsidy offered to the retailer. When multiple retailers compete in that product's market, there are two ways to envision and model the demand and market split. One assumes that market demand depends on aggregate inventory displayed, and then splits according to individual display levels. The other \u201cassigns\u201d customers to retailers according to their display levels, and then assumes that purchases are a function of the display level at the retailer selected.

The optimal replenishment and production policies for a supplier are found to be up-to policies, which are shown to be easily computed by decoupling the periods when the supplier outsources from those when the supplier does not outsource. A simple application of the newsvendor relation is used to define the retailer's optimal policy. Numerical analysis is conducted to compare the performance of a single supplier and a single retailer operating under a (z, Z) VMI contract with the performance of those operating under traditional retailer-managed inventory (RMI) with information sharing.

We evaluate the factors determining optimal development-cycle length and intensity using a forward-looking model that allows for multiple product generations.

We present an exact iterative algorithm for computing the distribution of the number of orders outstanding, and formulae for the inventory shortfall distribution (the quantity of inventory in replenishment at the start of a period) and the more common lead-time demand distribution, which are different when order crossover is possible. The lead-time demand distribution can have much higher variability than the shortfall distribution. We show that basing inventory policies on the lead-time demand distribution\u2014rather than the shortfall distribution\u2014can lead to significantly higher inventory cost, even if the probability of order crossover is small. We give an alternative proof to that of Zalkind (1976), which shows that the variance of shortfall is less than the variance of the standard lead-time demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.3.175.9887","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

This article reports a retailer's challenge to balance transportation, shelf space, and inventory costs. A retailer sells multiple products with stochastic demand. Trucks are dispatched from a warehouse and arrive at a store with a constant lead time. Each truck has a finite capacity and incurs a fixed shipping cost, no matter the number of units shipped. There is a per unit shelf-space cost as well as holding and backorder penalty costs. Three policies are considered for dispatching trucks: a minimum quantity continuous review policy, a full service periodic review policy, and a minimum quantity periodic review policy. The first policy ships a truck when demand since the previous shipment equals a fixed fraction of a truck's capacity, i.e., a minimum truck utilization. The exact analysis of that policy is the same as the analysis of reorder point policies for the multiechelon problem with one-warehouse, multiple retailers, and stochastic demand. That analysis is not computationally prohibitive, but the minimum quantity level can be chosen with a simple economic order quantity (EOQ) heuristic. An extensive numerical study finds the following: Either of the two periodic review policies may have substantially higher costs than the continuous review policy, in particular when the warehouse to store lead time is short; the EOQ heuristic performs quite well; the minimum quantity policy's total cost is relatively insensitive to the chosen transportation utilization, and its total cost is close to a lower bound developed for this problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.3.211.9893","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail operations and cost management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The model extends the newsvendor problem with pricing by allowing for multiple suppliers, the pooling of procurement resources, and more general informational dynamics. One contribution is the solution procedure: We show that all decisions (up to 7 in all, including recourse decisions) can be determined uniquely as a function of a surrogate first-period decision called the stocking factor. Hence, the two-period decision problem with recourse reduces to a search for one decision variable. A second contribution is the policy implications: We find that the cost of learning is (1) a consequence of censored information because, on the margin, learning is free if full information is guaranteed; (2) measured in the form of an increased stocking factor; and (3) shared with the consumer in the form of a higher selling price when demand uncertainty is additive. A third contribution is the application of the results to three motivating examples: a market research problem in which a product is introduced in a test market prior to a widespread launch; a global newsvendor problem in which a seasonal product is sold in two different countries with nonoverlapping selling seasons; and a minimum-quantity commitment problem in which procurement resources for multiple purchases may be pooled.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.3.242.9888","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory and pricing decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The question of whether there is empirical evidence that services, specifically retail banks, display the characteristics of agility like their manufacturing counterparts is open to debate. Conventional wisdom in operations management posits that most successful services trade off one capability for another. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, combinative capabilities view, and the cybernetics work of Ashby (1958), theoretical arguments suggest the contrary. The agility paradigm is viable in environments calling for a mix of strategic responses. Applying cluster analytic techniques to a sample of retail banks, using capabilities as taxons, we identify four strategic service groups: agile, traditionalists, niche, and straddlers. Our empirical results provide thematic explanations consistent with theory that account for how the agile strategic group offers a unique configuration of service concept, resource competencies, strategic choices, and business orientation. Profiles of the operations strategies of each strategic service group suggest that each group has found a fit between what certain segments of the market may want and what they have to offer. In particular, we found that the agile group exhibited greater resource competencies than its counterparts, requiring greater investments in infrastructure and technology. Consistent with theory, agile banks performed better over time on an absolute measure of return on assets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.4.273.9969","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['agility', 'operations capabilities', 'strategic responses']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and strategic capabilities in retail banking, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting wholesale price depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the wholesale price increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i.e., captures a greater share of potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher wholesale price reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a wholesale price below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a wholesale price below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.4.293.9971","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of supply chain contracts and profitability without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as DEI, ethics, or social justice."],["2001","3","4","Hari S.

By studying the resulting safety leadtimes implied by each policy we gain insight into why some policies perform more robustly with respect to different measures of customer service than do others. This analysis suggests that a simple constant safety leadtime policy should work reasonably well under most conditions. A series of simulation experiments of more complex production environments indicates that the constant safety leadtime policy does indeed exhibit robust performance. This, plus the fact that it is extremely simple to adapt to a wide range of production environments, makes it an attractive basis for real-world leadtime-quoting systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.4.321.9968","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of leadtime-quoting policies and customer service constraints without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem is analyzed as a Stackelberg game in which the vendor acts as the leader and buyers act as followers. A simple strategy is developed for the vendor to employ a uniform quantity-discount policy to coordinate buyers' replenishment times by the power-of-two policy. Solution procedures are developed for the equilibrium strategy. It is shown that time coordination generally has a substantial benefit for the vendor, although the benefit to the buyers may be limited. Furthermore, uniform quantity discounts to all buyers are normally feasible but not sufficient to achieve perfect channel coordination when buyers act independently. The proposed strategy obtains a high proportion of the maximum benefit under perfect channel coordination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.4.337.9974","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of distribution systems and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We carry the analysis in terms of a simplified model which entails N retailers who face stochastic demands and hold stocks locally and/or at one or more central locations. An exogenously specified fraction of any unsatisfied demand (demand greater than locally available stock) at a retailer could be satisfied using excess stocks at other retailers and/or stocks held at a central location. We consider inventory ordering and allocation decisions. The operational decisions of inventory and allocation of stocks and the financial decision of allocation of revenues/costs must be made in a way consistent with the individual incentives of the various independent retailers. We develop a \u201ccoopetitive\u201d framework for the sequential decisions of inventory and allocation. We introduce the notion of claims that allows us to separate the ownership (with decision rights) and the location of inventories in the system. For the cooperative shipping and allocation decision, we use the concept of core and develop sufficient conditions for the existence of the core. For the inventory decision, we develop conditions for the existence of a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. For this decentralized system, we show that there exists an allocation mechanism that achieves the first-best solution for inventory deployment and allocation. We develop conditions under which the first-best equilibrium will be unique. Our model can be easily generalized to include complicated ownership structures such as \u201csuper dealers,\u201d partnerships, \u201cinventory speculators,\u201d and situations in retail e-commerce settings such as \u201cclick-through arrangements,\u201d separation of \u201cdemand generators,\u201d and \u201cfulfillment houses,\u201d etc. It can also be applied to situations involving capacity allocations and product substitutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.3.4.349.9973","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decentralized distribution systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Optimal Replacement Policies for a Motion Picture Exhibitor","Every week, motion picture exhibitors must decide whether to keep or replace the movies playing in their theaters in light of the past week's sales data. This decision is complex because of the dynamic decision environment, the uncertainty of demand, the complex revenue-sharing terms between the retailer and the distributor, the need to commit to new movies for several weeks, and the competitive release patterns of movies. We formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, using it to obtain replacement policies for the exhibitor. We examine the effect of differences in quality and quantity of available movies, and their respective release dates on the returns from model-based normative solutions. We also show that two practical heuristics are significantly outperformed by the optimal policy for the MDP model.

Such a policy determines whether the facility should be producing (idling decisions), and if it should, which product class (sequencing decisions).

In many practical situations, however, a set of delivery dates may be fixed before any jobs are processed. This is particularly relevant where delivery is an expensive or complicated operation, for example, as with heavy machinery. A similar situation arises where customers find deliveries disruptive and thus require them to be made within a limited time interval that repeats periodically. A third possibility is that a periodic business function, for example, the supplier's billing cycle, effectively defines a delivery date, and includes all jobs that have been completed since the previous billing cycle. These situations are not adequately represented by classical scheduling models. We consider a variety of deterministic scheduling problems in which a job is dispatched to a customer at the earliest fixed delivery date that is no earlier than the completion time of its processing. Problems where the number of delivery dates is constant, and others where it is specified as part of data input, are studied. For almost all problems considered, we either provide an efficient algorithm or establish that such an algorithm is unlikely to exist. By doing so, we permit comparisons between the solvability of these fixed delivery date problems and of the corresponding classical scheduling problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.1.134.11192","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on classical scheduling models and technical algorithms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A known quantity of resource is available, and demands for the resource arrive randomly over time. Each demand requires an amount of resource and has an associated reward. The resource requirements and rewards are unknown before arrival and become known at the time of the demand's arrival. Demands can be either accepted or rejected. If a demand is accepted, the associated reward is received; if a demand is rejected, a penalty is incurred. The problem can be stopped at any time, at which time a terminal value is received that depends on the quantity of resource remaining. A holding cost that depends on the amount of resource allocated is incurred until the process is stopped. The objective is to determine an optimal policy for accepting demands and for stopping that maximizes the expected value (rewards minus costs) accumulated. The DSKP is analyzed for both the infinite horizon and the finite horizon cases. It is shown that the DSKP has an optimal policy that consists of an easily computed threshold acceptance rule and an optimal stopping rule. A number of monotonicity and convexity properties are studied. This problem is motivated by the issues facing a manager of an LTL transportation operation regarding the acceptance of loads and the dispatching of a vehicle. It also has applications in many other areas, such as the scheduling of batch processors, the selling of assets, the selection of investment projects, and yield management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.1.26.11185","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical resource allocation problem without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly at the lower echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model's utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon's reorder point to yield near zero safety stock, yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs.

An Experiment in Domestic Airline Security","The paper describes a scientific experiment about a contentious policy issue: What costs and disruptions might arise if U.S. domestic airlines adopted positive passenger bag-match (PPBM), an antiterrorist measure aimed at preventing baggage unaccompanied by passengers from traveling in aircraft luggage compartments? The heart of the effort was a two-week live test of domestic bag-match that involved 11 airlines, 8,000 flights, and nearly 750,000 passengers. Working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the authors played a major role in designing, monitoring, and analyzing the live test. However, the live test provided \u201craw materials\u201d for an assessment of PPBM rather than the assessment itself.

These techniques are required, for example, if the value of a project develops stochastically over time and the decision to invest into this project can be postponed. Yet, so far there are no considerations regarding how this perception of projects reflects on a capital budgeting situation. We propose two approaches that integrate these methods with traditional capital budgeting models. A simple capital budgeting model can be formulated as the problem of finding the portfolio of options that has maximal value and fulfils the capital expenditure constraint. However, this model has some shortcomings regarding its applicability in traditional budgeting situations. Therefore, we define an alternative optimisation model that uses scenarios to depict a set of possible future states. The optimal portfolio is then equivalent to a dynamic investment strategy that determines a number of state-dependent optimal portfolios.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.2.196.13531","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital budgeting and investment strategies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Random demand arises at Stage 1, Stage 1 orders from Stage 2, etc., and Stage N orders from an outside supplier with unlimited stock. The demand distribution in each period is determined by the current state of an exogenous Markov chain. Excess demand is backlogged. Linear holding costs are incurred at every stage, and linear backorder costs are incurred at Stage 1. The ordering costs are also linear. The objective is to minimize the long-run average costs in the system. The paper shows that the optimal policy is an echelon base-stock policy with state-dependent order-up-to levels. An efficient algorithm is also provided for determining the optimal base-stock levels. The results can be extended to serial systems in which there is a fixed ordering cost at stage N and to assembly systems with linear ordering costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.2.226.13528","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory management and cost minimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Such problems are usually large and sparse. Existing software for global optimization cannot cope with problems of this size, while current local sparse NLP solvers, e.g., MINOS (Murtagh and Saunders 1987), or CONOPT (Drud 1994) cannot guarantee a global solution. In this paper, we apply the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) algorithm to two large nonconvex water resources models involving reservoir operations and water allocation in a river basin, using an approximation to the GBD cuts proposed by Floudas et al. (1989) and Floudas (1995). To ensure feasibility of the GBD subproblem, we relax its constraints by introducing elastic slack variables, penalizing these slacks in the objective function. This approach leads to solutions with excellent objective values in run times much less than the GAMS NLP solvers MINOS5 and CONOPT2, if the complicating variables are carefully selected. Using these solutions as initial points for MINOS5 or CONOPT2 often leads to further improvements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.2.235.13537","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical solutions to optimization problems in water resources management without addressing social issues, ethical considerations, or any themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2001","49","2","David M.

Most of the debate has presumed that there is one answer to that question, but it seems plausible that the mix of interventions should vary as the size of the problem changes. We formulate the choice between treatment and enforcement as an optimal control problem and reach the following conclusions. If initiation into drug use is an increasing function of the current number of users and control begins early, then it is optimal to use very large amounts of both enforcement and treatment to cut short the epidemic. Otherwise the optimal policy is not to stop the growth of the epidemic, but rather to moderate it. Initially this should be done primarily with enforcement. Over time, enforcement spending should increase, but not nearly so fast as treatment spending. Hence, treatment should receive a larger share of control resources when a drug problem is mature than when it is first growing. If initiation rates subsequently decline, enforcement's budget share should drop further in the ensuing declining stage of the epidemic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.3.352.11215","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['treatment', 'enforcement', 'drug control']","The article discusses the allocation of resources between treatment and enforcement in drug control, which touches on social issues related to public health.

Through inspection and rework, the system can improve the quality of the units received from the supply sources. There are two interleaved decisions: the replenishment quantities from the sources and the inspection-rework quantities among the units received. We show the optimal solution to the replenishment decision can be efficiently derived from a greedy algorithm, and inspection-rework is optimally applied to a single source identified by the algorithm.

In SMAA, the decision makers need not express their preferences explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the method is based on exploring the weight space in order to describe the valuations that would make each alternative the preferred one. Inaccurate or uncertain criteria values are represented by probability distributions from which the method computes confidence factors describing the reliability of the analysis. In this paper we introduce the SMAA-2 method, which extends the original SMAA by considering all ranks in the analysis. In situations where the \u201celitistic\u201d SMAA may assess large acceptability only for extreme alternatives without sufficient majority support, the more holistic SMAA-2 analysis can be used to identify good compromise candidates. The results are presented graphically. We consider also situations where partial preference information is available.

The large integer programming formulation is solved by a branch-and-bound method that relaxes some of the integrality constraints. At each node of the tree, a mixed-integer problem is solved by a Benders decomposition approach in which the LP relaxations of multicommodity network flow problems are optimized either by the simplex algorithm or by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition.

Specifically, using the SIPP approach can result in staffing levels that do not meet specified period by period probability of delay targets during a significant fraction of the cycle. We determine the manner in which the various system parameters affect SIPP reliability and identify domains for which SIPP will be accurate.

We analyze the performance of a heuristic priority-index rule, which extends Klimov's optimal solution to the single-server case: servers select preemptively customers with larger Klimov indices. We present closed-form suboptimality bounds (approximate optimality) for Klimov's rule, which imply that its suboptimality gap is uniformly bounded above with respect to (i) external arrival rates, as long as they stay within system capacity; and (ii) the number of servers. It follows that its relative suboptimality gap vanishes in a heavy-traffic limit, as external arrival rates approach system capacity (heavy-traffic optimality). We obtain simpler expressions for the special no-feedback case, where the heuristic reduces to the classical c\u03bc rule. Our analysis is based on comparing the expected cost of Klimov's rule to the value of a strong linear programming (LP) relaxation of the system's region of achievable performance of mean queue lengths. In order to obtain this relaxation, we derive and exploit a new set of work decomposition laws for the parallel-server system. We further report on the results of a computational study on the quality of the c\u03bc rule for parallel scheduling.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.4.609.11225","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization of scheduling in queue systems without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This process involves melting steel and alloys in the desired chemical composition, then pouring it into a variety of ingot molds. Complex technological and resource constraints can make the planning and scheduling of such processes extremely challenging. In this paper, we report our experience in developing solution methods for this \u201cmelt scheduling\u201d problem at BethForge, a division of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and a manufacturer of custom-made heavy steel forgings. We describe the main issues associated with generic melt-scheduling problems as well as constraints that are specific to BethForge. The problem at BethForge is particularly challenging, because of the need to keep the ingot at a high temperature before forging, their large product variety, and the need to consider trade-offs between two conflicting objectives. We first formulate the base melt-scheduling problem as a mixed-integer program. We then decouple the scheduling decisions into two levels and develop a local search algorithm based on Storer and Wu's problem space neighborhood. Our aim is to generate a family of efficient schedules that allow decision makers to balance the trade-off between two criteria. Computational experiments are performed using data from BethForge.

Stochastic demand is monitored continuously. Retailers incur inventory holding and backorder penalty costs. The supplier incurs holding costs for its inventory and backorder penalty costs for backorders at the retailers. The latter cost reflects the supplier's desire to maintain adequate availability of its product to consumers. Previous research finds the supply chain cost minimizing reorder point policies, the cooperative solution. The competitive solution is a Nash equilibrium, a set of reorder points such that no firm can deviate from the equilibrium and lower its cost. It is shown that Nash equilibria exist and a method is presented to find all of them. In some settings the cooperative solution is a Nash equilibrium; competition does not necessarily lead to supply chain inefficiency. In other settings, competition leads to costs that are substantially higher than optimal. Usually (but not always), the competitive supply chain carries too little inventory. Three cooperation strategies are discussed: change incentives, change equilibrium, and change control. A set of contracts is provided that changes the firms' incentives so that the optimal policy is a Nash equilibrium. An equilibrium change can improve performance but does not guarantee optimal performance. To change control, the firms let the supplier choose all reorder points, a key component in vendor managed inventory. That change leads to optimal supply chain performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.5.658.10611","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and supply chain dynamics without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2001","49","5","Chris KenyonChris Kenyonchk@zurich.ibm.comIBM Research, Zurich Research Laboratory, S\u00e4umerstrasse 4, CH8803 R\u00fcschlikon, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author, Stathis TompaidisStathis Tompaidisstathis.tompaidis@bus.utexas.eduMSIS Department and Center for Computational Finance, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712-1175Search for more papers by this author","Real Options in Leasing: The Effect of Idle Time","We study options on short-term leases for capital-intensive equipment performing specific functions and services, such as leases for semi-submersible drilling rigs, marine seismic services, corporate real estate leasing, retail space leasing, and apartment leasing.

In this light, adjustments to the rate of production are viewed as a sequence of (nested) real options affording operating flexibility. We account for an optimal sequence of production adjustments, over a preestablished production horizon, by taking the production rate as an adapted positive real-valued process.

The servers are mutually interfering in that their service rates are nonlinearly interdependent functions of the controls applied by the servers, and external discrete-valued continuous-time random disturbances. At certain time epochs, namely, every \u0394 time units, the servers may adjust their service rates by changing the values of their controls; however, the system may change its state several times between successive decision epochs. The stability region of the system is established and a service rate control policy \u03c0* is provided, where an arrival rate vector in the interior of the region is sufficient for stability under \u03c0*, and a vector in the closure is necessary for stability under any policy. The stability region depends on \u0394 and the variations of the disturbances between decision epochs, and \u03c0* does not require knowledge of the arrival rates. The stability region is not in general monotonic in \u0394, but under perfect continuous control (\u0394 = 0) the stability region is a superset of that under \u0394 > 0.

The queue length evolves as a birth-and-death process with constant arrival rate \u03bb = 1 and with state-dependent service rates \u03bcn that can be chosen from a fixed subset A of [0, \u221e). Finally, there is a nondecreasing cost-of-effort function c(\u00b7) on A, and service costs are incurred at rate c(\u03bcn) when the queue length is n. The objective is to minimize average cost per time unit over an infinite planning horizon. The standard optimality equation of average-cost dynamic programming allows one to write out the optimal service rates in terms of the minimum achievable average cost \u03b6*. Here we present a method for computing \u03b6* that is so fast and so transparent it may be reasonably described as an explicit solution for the problem of service rate control. The optimal service rates are nondecreasing as a function of queue length and are bounded if the holding cost function is bounded. From a managerial standpoint it is natural to compare \u03b6*, the minimum average cost achievable with state-dependent service rates, against the minimum average cost achievable with a single fixed service rate. The difference between those two minima represents the economic value of a responsive service mechanism, and numerical examples are presented that show it can be substantial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.5.720.10605","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and cost optimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Recent Bayesian work considers opportunity cost and shows that an average case analysis may be less conservative but assumes a known output variance, an assumption that typically is violated in simulation. This paper presents new two-stage and sequential selection procedures that integrate attractive features of both lines of research. They are derived assuming that the simulation output is normally distributed with unknown mean and variance that may differ for each system. We permit the reduction of either opportunity cost loss or the probability of incorrect selection and allow for different replication costs for each system. The generality of our formulation comes at the expense of difficulty in obtaining exact closed-form solutions. We therefore derive a bound for the expected loss associated potentially incorrect selections, then asymptotically minimize that bound. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that our approach compares favorably with indifference-zone procedures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.5.732.10615","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical procedures for selecting simulated systems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

A major goal of this paper is to address some of those issues by presenting a self-consistent evaluation of the uncertainty about the mean value of the simulation output, when there is uncertainty in both the parameters and functional form of input distributions (structural uncertainty), and uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of simulation output (stochastic uncertainty), as is common in simulation practice. The analysis leads to an algorithm for randomly sampling input distributions and parameters before each simulation replication, using a Bayesian posterior distribution for input distributions and parameters, given historical data.

Let S denote the set of feasible solutions of an optimization problem P, let c be a specified cost vector, and x0 be a given feasible solution. The solution x0 may or may not be an optimal solution of P with respect to the cost vector c. The inverse optimization problem is to perturb the cost vector c to d so that x0 is an optimal solution of P with respect to d and \u2016d\u2212c\u2016p is minimum, where \u2016d\u2212c\u2016p is some selected Lp norm.

We prove the following results: (i) If the problem P is a linear programming problem, then its inverse problem under the L1 as well as L\u221e norm is also a linear programming problem. (ii) If the problem P is a shortest path, assignment or minimum cut problem, then its inverse problem under the L1 norm and unit weights can be solved by solving a problem of the same kind. For the nonunit weight case, the inverse problem reduces to solving a minimum cost flow problem. (iii) If the problem P is a minimum cost flow problem, then its inverse problem under the L1 norm and unit weights reduces to solving a unit-capacity minimum cost flow problem. For the nonunit weight case, the inverse problem reduces to solving a minimum cost flow problem. (iv) If the problem P is a minimum cost flow problem, then its inverse problem under the L\u221e norm and unit weights reduces to solving a minimum mean cycle problem. For the nonunit weight case, the inverse problem reduces to solving a minimum cost-to-time ratio cycle problem.

Let U denote the difference between an upper bound on an optimal value of xn and a lower bound on an optimal value of x1. Under the assumption that the evaluation of any function Cj (xj) takes O(1) time, we show that the generalized isotonic regression problem can be solved in O(n log U) time. This improves by a factor of n the previous best running time of O(n2 log U) to solve the same problem. In addition, when our algorithm is specialized to the isotonic median regression problem (where Cj(xj) = cj|xj\u2212aj|) for specified values of cjs and ajs, the algorithm obtains a real-valued optimal solution in O(n log n) time.

A supplier distributes a single product to multiple retailers, who in turn sell it to consumers. The retailers serve geographically dispersed, heterogeneous markets. The demand in each retail market arrives continuously at a constant rate, which is a general decreasing function of the retail price in the market. The supplier replenishes its inventory through orders (purchases, production runs) from a source with ample capacity. The retailers replenish their inventories from the supplier. We develop efficient algorithms to determine optimal pricing and replenishment strategies for the following three channel structures. The first is the vertically integrated channel, where the system-wide pricing and replenishment strategies are determined by a central planner whose objective is to maximize the system-wide profits. The second structure is that of a vertically integrated channel in which pricing and operational decisions are made sequentially by separate functional departments. The third channel structure is decentralized, i.e., the supplier and the retailers are independent, profit-maximizing firms with the supplier acting as a Stackelberg game leader. We apply our algorithms to a set of numerical examples to quantify the supply chain inefficiencies due to functional segregation or uncoordinated decision making in a decentralized channel.

This method involves simulating the system under a new distribution that accentuates the probability along the most likely paths to the rare event. Traditionally, insights from large deviations theory are used to identify the distribution emphasizing these most likely paths. In this paper we develop an intuitive cyclic approach for selecting such a distribution. The key idea is to select a distribution under which the event of interest is no longer rare and the probability of occurrence of a cycle in any sample path remains equal to the original probability of that cycle. We show that only an exponentially twisted distribution can satisfy this equiprobable cycle condition. Using this approach we provide an elementary derivation of the asymptotically optimal change of measure for level crossing probability for Markov-additive processes. To demonstrate its ease of use for more complex stochastic systems, we apply it to determine the asymptotically optimal change of measure for estimating buffer overflow probability of a single-server queue subject to server interruptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.6.900.10016","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for stochastic systems without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

Passengers from the origins fly to the destination via the hub. Seat capacity of the hub-destination flight is fixed. Demands at origins are assumed to obey the Poisson process. To maximize the expected revenue, management faces decisions on allocating seats among competing origin-destination routes. This study presents a stochastic control model and develops optimal control rules. The basic model is subsequently distended to consider multiple fares on each route, time-dependent demands, and booking control on an extended network. A numerical example shows that optimal seat control is simple and efficient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.6.938.10026","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in airline seat inventory control with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our approach is to use the data provided by the first stage of sampling in an R&S procedure to screen out alternatives that are not competitive, and thereby avoid the (typically much larger) second-stage sample for these systems. Our procedures represent a compromise between standard R&S procedures\u2014which are easy to implement, but can be computationally inefficient\u2014and fully sequential procedures\u2014which can be statistically efficient, but are more difficult to implement and depend on more restrictive assumptions.

(2001a, b) formulated a class of combined screening-and-selection procedures for identifying the simulated system with optimal expected response when the number of alternatives is finite, but large enough to render conventional ranking-and-selection procedures impractical. Under a certain key assumption, they derived an additive decomposition lemma that provides a lower bound on the correct-selection probability when either the original or group-screening version of their combined screening-and-selection procedure is applied to randomly sampled normal populations with unknown and unequal variances. For both these procedures, we establish an improved lower bound on the correct-selection probability that is the product of (a) the probability that the best alternative will survive the first-stage screening procedure, and (b) the probability that the second-stage sampling-and-selection procedure will correctly identify the best alternative starting from the full set of alternatives. This multiplicative decomposition property offers a different perspective on the probabilistic structure of the entire class of combined screening-and-selection procedures developed by Nelson et al., and it does not require the key assumption of their additive decomposition lemma.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.49.6.964.10013","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of screening-and-selection procedures without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Despite the increased concern about managing strategic alliances, the field still lacks a theoretical framework to describe the conditions and dynamics leading to the failure of strategic alliances. This paper attempts to distill, derive, and integrate theories across different disciplines into a unified framework that offers a better understanding of alliance failure. The conceptual framework focuses on two primary sources of alliance failure: interfirm rivalry and managerial complexity. We propose that strategic alliances fail because of the opportunistic hazards as each partner tries to maximize its own individual interests instead of collaborative interests. Also, strategic alliances fail because of the difficulties in coordinating two independent firms (i.e., coordination costs), and in aligning operations at the alliance level with parent firms\u2019 long-term goals (i.e., agency costs). The paper extends the theoretical framework by looking into a process model of alliance development and failure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.1.37.10118","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic alliances and their failures without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

One-way ANOVA and planned contrast tests (PCT) were used to identify whether or not specific product innovation decisions, activities, and performance vary across the groups. The results indicate that these groups of firms significantly differ with respect to both subjective and objective measures of new product performance, and with product innovation strategies and activities pertaining to timing of market entry, product quality, marketing synergy, proficiency of market launch, and management support for innovation. Further, the findings suggest that these groups of firms are not significantly different with respect to perceived environmental hostility and intensity of market competition.

Information technologies provide cost-effective functionalities for building knowledge platforms through systematic acquisition, storage, and dissemination of organizational knowledge. However, in order to gain the value-adding potential of organizational knowledge, it is not sufficient to simply adopt and deploy IT-enabled knowledge platforms. These platforms must be assimilated into the ongoing work processes in organizations. Yet, theories of technology innovation and use suggest that a variety of institutional, social, and political factors blend together in influencing the extent to which complex information technologies are actually assimilated into organizational practice. Therefore, this research addresses a significant question: What forces influence the assimilation of knowledge platforms in organization? Given the significant gap between the adoption and actual assimilation of complex technologies into organizations, this is an important question. Empirical evidence is generated by examining the forces influencing the assimilation of CASE technologies in systems development projects in organizations. CASE is considered to be one of the most mature knowledge platforms in contemporary organizations. The empirical evidence sheds light on the role of institutional forces that influence the rate of assimilation of the technology. The findings have significant implications for further research and practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.2.117.10115","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional forces', 'organizational knowledge', 'assimilation']","The article discusses the assimilation of knowledge platforms and the influence of institutional and social factors, which hints at a consideration of broader societal impacts.

Using social identification and social enactment theories as conceptual anchors, the study reveals that national social identities were the dominant sense-making vehicle used by team members, although multiple sources of social identification were possible and present in this IJV. Contextual changes occurred that could be expected to favor organizational (IJV-based) social identities, but the dominant use of nationality-based identities did not change. Our findings suggest that social identity enactments (using particular boundaries to define primary social identities) by team members mediate the relationship of contextual variables, both environmental and structural, with group and organizational outcomes (such as role investment and job satisfaction). Our empirical results shed light on unresolved debates in the IJV literature, e.g., the implications of cultural distance and shared management for IJV performance.

Practice, we suggest, creates epistemic differences among the communities within a firm, and the firm's advantage over the market lies in dynamically coordinating the knowledge produced by these communities despite such differences. In making this argument, we argue that analyses of systemic innovation should be extended to embrace all firms in a knowledge economy, not just the classically innovative.

Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a \u201cself-control\u201d problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which \u201charm themselves as well as those around them\u201d (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm.

There are two diametrically opposing viewpoints. Adaptation theories predict that change occurs as fluid organizations adjust to meet shifting environmental demands, while selection theories predict that change occurs through the differential selection and replacement of inert organizations as environmental demands vary over time. Our paper bridges these polar opposites by using a punctuated equilibrium framework to examine organizations' responses to discontinuous industry-level change. This framework recognizes that the histories of many industries are occasionally punctuated by dramatic exogenous shocks, such as radical technological innovation, social and political turmoil, major changes in government regulation, and economic crashes. Our central thesis is that such environmental punctuations dramatically reduce pressures and rewards for organizational inertia and thereby alter both organizations' propensities for change and their survival chances following change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.3.253.10104","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['regulatory', 'change', 'organizational inertia']","The article discusses organizational adaptation to environmental changes, touching on regulatory impacts, but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

Our findings suggest, however, that the choice of emulation target within one's industry is not simply a matter of choosing the most structurally similar organization, but rather that identity-related attributes, such as reputation, organizational image, and organizational identity, also play a significant role in the emulation decision. The data also show that industry subgroups based on emulation decisions (strategic reference groups) differ in both structural and identity-related attributes. Further, interorganizational emulation decisions based on tactics of upward comparison (e.g., emulating universities with better reputations) are associated with greater strategic change, while downward comparisons are associated with greater perceived external threat. Finally, the data show that top management's perceptions of the university's level of environmental threat are related to their choice of a more coarse-grained or fine-grained set of attributes when determining the emulation target. We discuss some of these findings\u2019implications for theory and practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.3.312.10101","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['identity', 'reputation', 'organizational image']","The article discusses identity-related attributes in decision-making processes, which touches on themes of organizational identity and reputation.

From a case study of a unique organization whose purpose is to facilitate strategic knowledge distillation, it was found that this process is characterized by targeted information gathering that relies on diverse experts for interpretation as well as validation. It also embodies the organizational capability to leverage information technologies in the distillation effort, integrating them with processes for generating, storing, and transporting rich, de-embedded knowledge across multiple levels of the organization. As a result of the case study, a model of the strategic learning is developed and a series of propositions regarding its context and processes are presented based on this model. The model highlights key dimensions of strategic learning that suggest design parameters for organizations building strategic learning systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.3.331.10105","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['diverse experts', 'organizational capability', 'knowledge management']","The article discusses the involvement of 'diverse experts' in the strategic learning process, indicating some awareness of diversity themes.

It presents a model of these processes which is grounded in study of thirteen geographically dispersed teams. Five types of problems constituting failures of mutual knowledge are identified: failure to communicate and retain contextual information, unevenly distributed information, difficulty communicating and understanding the salience of information, differences in speed of access to information, and difficulty interpreting the meaning of silence. The frequency of occurrence and severity of each problem in the teams are analyzed. Attribution theory, the concept of cognitive load, and feedback dynamics are harnessed to explain how dispersed partners are likely to interpret failures of mutual knowledge and the consequences of these interpretations for the integrity of the effort. In particular, it is suggested that unrecognized differences in the situations, contexts, and constraints of dispersed collaborators constitute \u201chidden profiles\u201d that can increase the likelihood of dispositional rather than situational attribution, with consequences for cohesion and learning. Moderators and accelerators of these dynamics are identified, and implications for both dispersed and collocated collaboration are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.3.346.10098","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['collaboration', 'context', 'communication', 'dispersed', 'attribution']","The article discusses the challenges of collaboration in geographically dispersed teams, touching on themes of communication and context, which can relate to equity and inclusion in teamwork.

Findings suggest that organizational disidentification is a self-perception based on: (1) a cognitive separation between one's identity and the organization's identity, and (2) a negative relational categorization of oneself and the organization (e.g., categorizations such as \u201crivals\u201d or \u201cenemies\u201d). Organizational disidentification appears to be motivated by individuals' desires to both affirm positive distinctiveness and avoid negative distinctiveness by distancing themselves from incongruent values and negative stereotypes attributed to an organization. Our findings also suggest that organizational disidentification can lead individuals to take action (either volunteer work or voicing their opinion) as a result of their perceived separation from the organization's identity.

Events are critical triggers of institutional transformation and industry evolution. However, they must first become the focus of public attention to have this effect. We draw on a paired case comparison of media coverage of eight nonroutine events affecting the natural environment and the U.S. chemical industry. We employ both deductive and inductive analysis to develop a model and hypotheses to explain two research questions. First, what determines the initial public attention to an event? Second, when and why do certain events attain high and sustained levels of industry attention? A key inference is that whether an event receives industry-level attention depends on either outsiders holding the industry accountable for the event, or insiders' internal concerns with the industry image. We further infer that an event can be transformed into a critical issue for an industry, warranting sustained attention, if there is contestation with outsiders over the accountability for the event and its enactment, and internal contradictions and challenges to the industry's identity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.4.414.10639","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['accountability', 'external events', 'industry attention', 'institutional transformation']","The article discusses accountability and the public's attention to external events, which suggests a moderate engagement with social responsibility themes.

Why and how is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality (TWQ). The six facets of the TWQ construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between TWQ and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that TWQ (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between TWQ and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, TWQ shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.4.435.10635","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['teamwork', 'success', 'satisfaction']","The article discusses teamwork and its impact on project success, emphasizing aspects like team member satisfaction.

In this article, we explore two fundamentally different models that describe how trust might have positive effects on attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and performance outcomes within organizational settings. In the first section of the article, we examine the model that has dominated the literature: Trust results in direct (main) effects on a variety of outcomes. In the second section of the article we develop an alternative model: Trust facilitates or hinders (i.e., moderates) the effects of other determinants on attitudinal, perceptual, behavioral and performance outcomes via two distinct perceptual processes. Lastly, we discuss the conditions under which each of the models is most likely to be applicable. The theory is supplemented with a review of empirical studies spanning 40 years regarding the consequences of trust in organizational settings. The theoretical framework presented in this article provides insight into the processes through which trust affects organizational outcomes, provides guidance to researchers for more accurately assessing the impact of trust, provides a framework for better understanding past research on the consequences of trust, and suggests ways that organizational settings can be modified to capitalize on high levels of trust or mitigate the effects of low levels of trust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.4.450.10640","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'organizational', 'outcomes']","The article discusses trust within organizational settings, which is relevant to management practices, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This study addresses these questions by examining one financial institution's efforts to standardize and control decision making across geographically separated organizational units. We argue that decision-maker behavior is situated and is not simply a function of individual choice. Rather, in organizational settings decision-makers are subject to a hierarchy of influences that affect the decision processes they use and their resulting decision choices. To test our ideas, we examined 900 borrower \u201crisk rating\u201d decisions and found general support for our hypotheses. Decision makers were more likely to use the prescribed practice when decisions were important, when the decision target was known, and when the decision maker was located in a larger subunit. Decision makers altered their decision practices in the short term, but in the long term they appeared to partially revert to their earlier practices. Reliance on prescribed practice fostered stability in decisions, but surprisingly appeared to negatively affect future judgments. The findings indicate that organizations can change the more microaspects of decision making, but these changes may be transitory. Moreover the results suggest that decision makers may become complacent when they rely on prescribed decision practices, a tendency that can have untoward consequences for the organizations in which they are embedded.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.4.484.10634","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['decision-making', 'organizational practices', 'influence']","The article primarily focuses on decision-making processes within organizations and does not emphasize social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R\u2026D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity.

Such propensities are characteristically attributed to individual, organizational, and cultural traits such as risk aversion, uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of such phenomena. We show how the reproduction of successful actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased. These protections against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however. They increase the likelihood of persisting with alternatives that are poor in the long run as well as in the short run.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.5.523.10092","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['risk aversion', 'adaptation', 'bias']","The article primarily focuses on cognitive biases and decision-making processes rather than addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Subjects played an abstract coordination game which is like many organizational problems. Previous research showed that when larger groups play the game, they rarely coordinate on the Pareto-optimal (efficient) outcome, but small groups almost always coordinate on the efficient outcome. After two or three periods of playing the game, one subject who was randomly selected from among the participants to be the \u201cleader\u201d for the experiment was instructed to make a speech exhorting others to choose the efficient action. Based on previous studies, we predicted that small groups would succeed in achieving efficiency but that large groups would fail. Based on social psychological studies of the fundamental attribution error, we predicted that the subjects would underestimate the strength of the situational effect (group size) and attribute cause to personal traits of the leaders instead\u2014leaders would be credited for the success of the small groups, and blamed for the failure of the large groups. This hypothesis proved true: Subjects attributed differences in outcomes between conditions to differences in the effectiveness of leaders. In a second experiment, subjects voted to replace the leaders more frequently in the large-group condition (at a small cost to themselves), showing that misattributions of leadership ability also affect actual behavior by subjects. Previous research has demonstrated a tendency to credit or blame leaders for unusual performance. The difference in our study is that subjects should be blaming a structural condition\u2014the size of the group\u2014but they blame the leaders instead.

This practice is differentiated into distinct problems in value creation, each of which embodies the integral flow of work like a lateral slice, but which situates those problems in their own contexts. People understand themselves to be organized in an autonomous community of practice that takes charge of one of the problems.

These four perspectives offer alternative predictions about how and why resource endowments should affect the likelihood or magnitude of strategic change, and how and why they should moderate the relation between strategic change and performance. We examine the predictive power of these four alternative arguments using extensive longitudinal data from a single industry context characterized both by substantial resource heterogeneity and environmental turbulence. Results indicate that organizations possessing greater stocks of historically valuable resources were much less likely to engage in adaptive strategic change, but also that this resource-driven disinclination towards change tended to have a benign or even beneficial effect on performance. We discuss the implications of our theory and findings for the strategic change literature and also for the literature on the resource-based view of the firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.5.632.10088","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on resource endowments and strategic change without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Using a definition of organizational forms as external identity codes, we focus on two answers drawn from contemporary organization theory. The first holds that formal institutions such as industry associations and standard-setting bodies will result in a taken-for-granted organizational form. The second answer contends that increasing organizational density (number of organizations) will generate a legitimated organizational form. As reported here, a historical case study of the disk array market and its associated technologies finds both arguments limited. Although significant collective activity in association building and standard setting occurs among disk array producers, these have not yet led to an organizational form. Similarly, an observed trajectory of organizational density showing rapid growth followed by stabilization has not yet generated an organizational form. In our view, the diversity of origins and other activities of those organizations operating in this market work against institutionalization of the disk array organizational form. We reason that if firms in the market derive their primary identities from other activities (implying that there are few highly focused firms deriving their primary identity from disk arrays), then the disk array producer identity cannot cohere into a code or form. This conclusion suggests a respecification of the legitimation component of the density-dependent model of organizational evolution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.6.661.10083","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational evolution and market dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The innovator may be unable to appropriate all of the benefits from information technology investments. Airlines have installed computerized reservations systems in travel agencies to appropriate the returns from their investments in information technology. The airlines expected to obtain a number of benefits from this strategy, including increased efficiency, possible bias in favor of the computerized reservations systems owner on the part of the travel agent, and fees from other airlines for making reservations for them. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the appropriation of value by computerized reservations systems owners from deploying systems in travel agencies. These benefits, beyond fees from travel agents, should be seen in the vendor airline's market share between cities and in the overall performance of the airline at an industry level. This paper models airline performance as a function of computerized reservations systems ownership at two levels: for selected city-pairs and at the overall level of the firm. The city-pair analysis employs a multinomial logit market share model that analyzes five years of data on 72 city-pair routes. The industry model uses longitudinal data for a panel of 10 airlines for 12 years. The results of both analyses support hypotheses that computerized reservations systems ownership is positively related to airline performance. It appears that strong airlines have appropriated the benefits of their computerized reservations systems, turning them into highly specialized assets for further travel-related innovation. This work offers useful theoretical extensions and methodological approaches for the study of similar kinds of network technology innovations that are currently being deployed in association with electronic commerce on the Internet.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.6.702.10087","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of computerized reservation systems and their impact on airline performance, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although replicators are becoming one of the dominant organizational forms of our time, they have been neglected by scholars interested in organizations.

Such a view clouds the strategic subtlety of replication by sidestepping the exploration efforts to uncover and develop the best business model as well as the ongoing assessment that precedes large-scale replication of it.

Feasibility is then attempted by shifting production amounts between periods. Computational tests conducted in 1,800 instances with up to 40 components and 18 periods have shown that feasible solutions were obtained in 83.7% of the instances. For the infeasible instances, on average, the heuristic is able to find solutions with very low capacity excess.

However, empirical evidence of the link between lean production practices and environmental performance has not resolved the nature of the relationship. To explore this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis of the environmental performance of 17,499 U.S. manufacturing establishments during the time period 1991\u20131996. We find that those establishments that adopt the quality management standard ISO 9000 are more likely to adopt the environmental management standard ISO 14000. We also find strong evidence that lean production, as measured by ISO 9000 adoption and low chemical inventories, is complementary to waste reduction and pollution reduction.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00373.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['environmental performance', 'public good', 'waste reduction', 'pollution reduction']","The article discusses the relationship between lean production and environmental performance, highlighting themes of sustainability and public good, which align with moderate woke themes.

Synthesizing earlier research, environmental management orientation is defined here to include system analysis and planning, organizational responsibility, and management controls. The relationship between a proactive orientation and two sets of internal factors, specifically the personal views of plant managers and plant\u2010specific characteristics, was tested using survey data from the furniture industry. The production outlook for the plant was critical, with a favorable outlook fostering a more proactive environmental management orientation. After controlling for plant\u2010specific factors, personal views also were influential; an increasing emphasis on short\u2010term economic value was related to a more reactive plant\u2010level orientation. Thus senior corporate management can foster strong plant\u2010level environmental management through a more balanced emphasis on economic and ethical values and continued investment in a plant's long\u2010term viability.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00374.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","6","['environmental management', 'organizational responsibility', 'ethical values']","The article discusses the importance of environmental management and the balance between economic and ethical values, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical practices in operations management.

Although ISO 9000 has become a de facto requirement for many firms, its effects are poorly understood, and similarly the value and domain of applicability of ISO 14000 have been questioned. This paper reports on an exploratory study into the global spread of ISO 14000. We interviewed practitioners worldwide to identify factors that they believe explain differences between national ISO 14000 certification counts. We then collected quantititive data for these factors and, using regression analysis, we found that exports, environmental attitudes (combined with economic development), and ISO 9000 certification count were significant. The fact that ISO 9000 appears as an important factor explaining diffusion of ISO 14000 certifications suggests that the drivers behind the two have significant overlap. This indicates that, although ISO 14000 is an environmental standard, many of the factors driving national certification patterns are not at all environmental in nature, and that ISO 14000 therefore needs to be studied from a broader perspective than from a purely environmental point of view.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00378.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","4","['environmental', 'certification', 'attitudes']","The article discusses ISO 14000, which is an environmental management standard, indicating a focus on sustainability.

This paper shows that the perceived competitiveness impact of the standard depends mostly on the involvement of firms' external stakeholders (distributors, customers, community members, and regulatory agencies) in its design. ISO 14001 is a process standard, and it is difficult for stakeholders to get credible information on the effectiveness of the standard if they are not involved in its design. Stakeholders' involvement in a firm's ISO 14001 standard becomes a valuable organizational capability, which is difficult to imitate by competitors. The analysis is supported by primary data collected from a questionnaire mailed to 152 firms, resulting in 55 observations representing 30% of the total number of firms certified in the U.S. in August 1998.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00379.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['stakeholders', 'environmental', 'involvement', 'community']","The article discusses the importance of stakeholder involvement in the design of environmental standards, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and community engagement.

We allow each instantaneous forward rate to be driven by a different stochastic shock, but constrain the shocks so that the forward rate curve is kept continuous. We term the shocks to the forward curve \u201cstochastic string shocks,\u201d and construct then as solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. This article offers a variety of parameterizations that can produce, with parsimony, any correlation pattern among forward rates of different maturities. We derive the no-arbitrage condition on the drift of forward rates shocked by stochastic strings and show how to price interest rate derivatives. Although derivatives can be easily priced, they can be perfectly hedged only by trading in an infinite number of bonds of all maturities. We show that the strings model is consistent with any panel dataset of bond prices, and does not require the addition of error terms in econometric models. Finally, we empirically calibrate some versions of the model and price the delivery option embedded in long bond futures. We show that the delivery option is much more valuable in string models than in a similar one-factor model. This is due to the greater variety of shapes of the term structure that string models can produce, which induces more changes in the cheapest-to-deliver bond.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/1/149/1587933","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical financial modeling and does not address any socially progressive themes, ethical considerations, or issues related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2001","14","1","Yan Jin\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Yan Jin\n            \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Yan Jin, Quantitative Strategies, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, 32 Old Slip, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10005, or e-mail: yan.jin@gs.com.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Paul Glasserman\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Paul Glasserman\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        The authors thank J.

The connections exploit the observation that a pricing kernel is uniquely determined by its drift. Through these connections we provide, for any arbitrage-free term structure model, a representative-consumer real production economy supporting that term structure model in equilibrium. We put particular emphasis on models in which interest rates remain positive. By modeling the dynamics of the drift of the pricing kernel, we construct a new family of Markovian-positive interest rate models.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/1/187/1588129","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of interest rate modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2001","14","1","John M.

Using returns measured over longer horizons, the importance of exchange rate shocks increases slightly and the importance of industry common shocks increases more substantially. Both industry and exchange rate shocks are more important for industries that produce internationally traded goods, but the importance of these shocks is economically small for these industries as well.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/1/215/1588505","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically exchange rate movements and their impact on stock returns, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2001","14","1","George Allayannis\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    George Allayannis\n            \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Address correspondence to George Allayannis, Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, University of Virginia, P.O.

In general, very little market movement is observed when insiders trade and when they report their trades to the SEC. Insiders in aggregate are contrarian investors. However, they predict market movements better than simple contrarian strategies. Insiders also seem to be able to predict cross-sectional stock returns. The result, however, is driven by insider\u2019s ability to predict returns in smaller firms.

Following the suggestions in Glosten and Jagannathan (1994), this article shows how to model hedge fund returns by focusing on the popular \u201ctrend-following\u201d strategy. We use lookback straddles to model trend-following strategies, and show that they can explain trend-following funds\u2019 returns better than standard asset indices. Though standard straddles lead to similar empirical results, lookback straddles are theoretically closer to the concept of trend following.

We find that VaR risk managers often optimally choose a larger exposure to risky assets than non-risk managers and consequently incur larger losses when losses occur. We suggest an alternative risk-management model, based on the expectation of a loss, to remedy the shortcomings of VaR. A general-equilibrium analysis reveals that the presence of VaR risk managers amplifies the stock-market volatility at times of down markets and attenuates the volatility at times of up markets.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/2/371/1601252","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management and financial modeling without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Owners can affect the level of underpricing through the choices they make in promoting an issue, such as which underwriter to hire or on what exchange to list. The benefits of reducing underpricing in this way depend on the owners\u2019 participation in the offering and the magnitude of the dilution they suffer on retained shares. We argue that the extent to which owners trade off underpricing and promotion is determined by the minimization of their wealth losses. Evidence from a sample of U.S. initial public offering confirms our empirical predictions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/2/433/1601769","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of IPOs and wealth losses without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2001","14","2","Vojislav Maksimovic\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Vojislav Maksimovic\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004University of Maryland\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Pegaret Pichler\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Pegaret Pichler\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Boston College\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        We thank Susanne Espenlaub, Paolo Fulghieri, Kathleen Hanley, Charlie Himmelberg, Gordon Phillips, Lemma Senbet, Alexander Triantis, an anonymous referee, and the editor, Sheridan Titman, for their comments.

Early private financing occurs in industries that are perceived to be risky, with high development costs and low probability of being displaced by technologically superior rivals.

Deterministic volatility models allowfor more flexible volatility surfaces but refrain from introducing additional risk factors. Thus, options are still redundant securities. Alternatively, stochastic models introduce additional risk factors, and options are then needed for spanning of the pricing kernel. We develop a statistical test based on this difference in spanning. Using daily S&P 500 index options data from 1986\u20131995, our tests suggest that both in- and out-of-the-money options are needed for spanning. The findings are inconsistent with deterministic volatility models but are consistent with stochastic models that incorporate additional priced risk factors, such as stochastic volatility, interest rates, or jumps.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/2/495/1602039","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of option pricing models and market behavior without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

This results in a penalty for foreign investors who buy and hold German dividend-paying stocks. I document that, as a result of the credit, the ex-day drop exceeds the dividend by more than one-half of the tax credit, and show that futures and option prices embed more than one-half of the tax credit. The existence of the credit creates opportunities for cross-border tax arbitrage\u2014in which foreign holders of German stock transfer the dividend to German shareholders\u2014and implies that it is tax efficient for foreign investors to hold derivatives rather than investing directly in German stocks.

We find that firms with high bankruptcy costs or with prospects of profit improvement can get bigger reductions on their debt repayments.

This article also presents empirical evidence, which indicates that expected returns on stocks and bonds vary with surplus consumption implied by the habit models.

Three types of disclosures are considered. One is information that complements the information available only to informed investors (to-be-processed complementary information). The second is information that is orthogonal to that which any investor can acquire and thus complements the information available to all investors (preprocessed complementary information). And the third is information that substitutes for the information of the informed investors in that it reveals to all what was previously known only by the informed (substitute information). Our main results are as follows. First, in equilibrium, all types of firms voluntarily disclose all three types of information. Second, in contrast to the existing literature, complementary information disclosure by firms strengthens investors\u2019 private incentives to acquire information. Substitute information disclosure weakens private information acquisition incentives. Third, while complementary information disclosure has an ambiguous effect on financial innovation incentives, substitute information disclosure weakens those incentives.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/4/1021/1595732","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information disclosure in finance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

During periods with powerful banks, firms\u2019 high cash holdings are consistent with banks extracting rents. When banks weakened, Japanese cash levels became more like U.S. firms.

The static relationship of ownership to control in Germany is therefore similar to the United Kingdom and the United States. However, there are marked differences in dynamic relations involving transfers of ownership. There is an active market in share blocks giving rise to changes in control, but the gains are limited and accrue solely to the holders of large blocks, not to minority investors. We provide evidence of low overall benefits to control changes and the exploitation of private benefits of control.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/14/4/943/1595587","article","RFS","Finance","2","['ownership', 'control', 'minority investors']","The article primarily focuses on corporate governance and performance metrics without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We conceive of business groups as responses to market failures and high transaction costs. In doing so, we develop hypotheses about the effects of group affiliation on firm profitability: affiliation could either boost or depress firm profitability, and members of a group are likely to earn rates of return similar to other members of the same group. Using a unique data set compiled largely from local sources, we test for these effects in 14 emerging markets: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. We find evidence that business groups indeed affect the broad patterns of economic performance in 12 of the markets we examine. Group affiliation appears to have as profound an effect on profitability as does industry membership, yet strategy scholars have a much clearer grasp of industries than of groups. Moreover, membership in a group raises the profitability of the average group member in several of the markets we examine. This runs contrary to the wisdom, conventional in advanced economies, that unrelated diversification depresses profitability. Overall, our findings suggest that the roots of sustained differences in profitability may vary across institutional contexts; conclusions drawn in one context may well not apply to another.

While his conceptualization has received much attention, little progress has been made because of a lack of empirical tools to examine his propositions. This article seeks to resolve this by describing a new instrument that was developed specifically for operationalizing Stevenson's conceptualization. After two pre-tests, the instrument was tested full scale on a very large (1200+ cases) stratified random sample of firms with different size, governance structure, and industry affiliation. The results show that both in the full sample and in various sub-samples it was possible to identify six sub-dimensions with high discriminant validity and moderate to high reliability, which represent dimensions of Stevenson's theoretical reasoning. We label these Strategic Orientation, Resource Orientation, Management Structure, Reward Philosophy, Growth Orientation and Entrepreneurial Culture. We were further able to show that these dimensions only partly overlap with \u2018Entrepreneurial Orientation\u2019, the hitherto best established empirical instrument for assessing a firm's degree of entrepreneurship. Our instrument should open up opportunities for researchers to further evaluate entrepreneurship in existing firms.

Although these ownership changes are rapidly gaining prominence, the academic literature has been equivocal about the performance benefits of private vs. state ownership. The lack of clarity in findings can be largely traced to the underspecification of the models that prior studies have examined. Specifically, prior studies have mostly ignored the central role of competitive rivalry. This paper proposes a model that centers around the interactive, inseparable effects of ownership and competitive rivalry on firm performance. Results of the empirical examination set in India show that competitive intensity moderates the relationship between ownership and performance.

Such gaps can occur on dimensions of observable demography, less apparent demography, or psychological characteristics. While compositional gaps in IJV management groups can provide the basis for healthy substantive conflict, such gaps\u2014particularly if they are large\u2014also tend to induce relationship conflict and heighten substantive conflict beyond its beneficial range. This can set off a downward spiral of relationship conflict, substantive conflict, and behavioral disintegration in the group.

To that end, Kwan and Tsang's argument for a critical realist perspective is valid. There however exist substantial nontrivial differences between constructivism and critical realism. While critical realism contests some of the default assumptions of empiricism and realism which treat social systems as closed systems, it is still predicated upon an inherent order of things that is graspable by research. Constructivism instead focuses on the manner in which researchers constitute theories in the act of describing them.

We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power.

First, trust between an IJV's parents and the IJV's relative absorptive capacity with its foreign parent are suggested to influence its ability to understand new knowledge held by foreign parents. Second, an IJV's learning structures and processes are proposed to influence its ability to assimilate new knowledge from those parents. Third, the IJV's strategy and training competence are suggested to shape its ability to apply the assimilated knowledge. Revisiting the Hungarian IJVs studied by Lyles and Salk (1996) 3 years later, we find support for the knowledge understanding and application predictions, and partial support for the knowledge assimilation prediction. Unexpectedly, our results suggest that trust and management support from foreign parents are associated with IJV performance but not learning. Our model and results offer a new perspective on IJV learning and performance as well as initial insights into how those relationships change over time.

We propose that the networks of emerging firms evolve in order to adapt to the firm's changing resource needs and resource challenges. As firms emerge, their networks consist primarily of socially embedded ties drawn from dense, cohesive sets of connections. We label these networks identity based. As firms move into the early growth stage, their networks evolve toward more ties based on a calculation of economic costs and benefits. This shift from identity-based to more calculative networks is manifested in the evolution of the firm networks: (1) from primarily socially embedded ties to a balance of embedded and arm's-length relations; (2) from networks that emphasize cohesion to those that exploit structural holes; and (3) from a more path-dependent to a more intentionally managed network. Thus, this paper suggests that both cohesive and sparse networks are conducive to firm performance when they are aligned with and address firms' evolving resource challenges.

While both theories have contributed to our understanding of strategic management and to the choice of strategy and structure, each theory offers managerial prescriptions that are incomplete at best. We contend that if followed in isolation, each theory can lead to inferior performance. This paper, which studies the international courier and small package (IC&SP) services in Japan, improves upon prescriptions from both theories by linking Porter's and Williamson's approaches. Our main proposition is contained in three relationships that predict a fit among three strategic choices: market position, resource profile, and organizational structure. We test our predictions with a three-stage, reduced-form, endogenous self-selection model. While our empirical methodology is complicated and relies on a multilevel analysis, the methodology is necessary both for analyzing a constellation of activities in the vertical chain and for assessing strategy, structure, and performance when data can be drawn from only a limited number of firms. Our results suggest that a firm's market position, resource profile, and organizational choice are related in ways predicted by a positioning-economizing perspective. To be sure, our study is ambitious and suffers from a number of limitations; nevertheless, it provides one of the first attempts to theoretically and empirically link Porter's SPF and Williamson's TCE.

Others emphasize the persistent diversity in business practices and behavior of firms from different nations as they invest abroad. Using the hard disk drive industry as a case, this paper explores whether nationality or industry has the greater influence on global strategy and whether it affects industry performance. The findings suggest that firms from the same nation are likely to adopt similar global strategies initially, but that, over time, the industry as a whole converges on the same blueprint for action. At the same time, however, strategic focus and organizational characteristics moderate national influences: firms from the same nation are more likely to adopt the same global strategy if they compete in the same product segment and are of similar size and age. The evidence also indicates that the national industry that is first to select what becomes the dominant strategy acquires an advantage over competitors from other countries.

Under the resource-picking mechanism, managers gather information and analysis to outsmart the resource market in picking resources, similar to the way that a mutual fund manager tries to outsmart the stock market in picking stocks. Under the capability-building mechanism, managers design and construct organizational systems to enhance the productivity of whatever resources the firm acquires. These two rent-creation mechanisms are certainly not mutually exclusive, and it is likely that firms generally use both of them. It is therefore important to consider the interaction between these two rent-creation mechanisms: Do they complement each other? Or are they substitutes for each other? In other words, do they enhance each other's value, or detract from each other's value? Answering these questions is a necessary precondition to understanding how firms should allocate their time and effort between these two rent-creation mechanisms. The present paper develops a basic theoretical model to address these questions, and derives testable hypotheses from the model.

Yet, firms need to compete with their competitors who also outsource and may share the same suppliers. This article explores how a firm could outperform others in managing the division of labor with a supplier in product development. Drawing on the empirical data collected from the Japanese auto industry, this paper shows that an automaker needs capabilities to coordinate various activities both externally with a supplier and internally within its own organization, in order to gain better component development performance. Overall, the results imply that outsourcing does not work effectively without extensive internal effort.

Our research used inductively derived themes from the letters to structure a mental model widely shared in the pharmaceutical industry, and then employed thematic variations to find stable clusters of companies. These thematic clusters were triangulated with the strategic groups from a published study of the same industry, in the same period, and were shown to converge.

We develop an integrative framework theorizing guanxi utilization according to institutional, strategic, and organizational factors, and we explore the impact of guanxi on firm performance, primarily sales growth and net profit growth. Our findings, based on a survey of 128 firms in central China, provide strong support that institutional, strategic, and organizational factors are critical determinants of guanxi with competitive forces.

Internal capabilities were operationalized by entrepreneurial orientation, technological capabilities, and financial resources invested during the development period. External networks were captured by partnership- and sponsorship-based linkages. Partnership-based linkages were measured by strategic alliances with other enterprises and venture capitalists, collaboration with universities or research institutes, and participation in venture associations. Sponsorship-based linkages consisted of financial and nonfinancial support from commercial banks and the Korean government. Sales growth indicated the start-up's performance. Regression results showed that the three indicators of internal capabilities are important predictors of a start-up's performance. Among external networks, only the linkages to venture capital companies predicted the start-up's performance. Several interaction terms between internal capabilities and partnership-based linkages have a statistically significant influence on performance. Sponsorship-based linkages do not have individual effects on performance but linkage with financial institutions has a multiplicative effect with technological capabilities and financial resources invested on a start-up's performance.

Building on the relational view and on social capital and knowledge-based theories, we propose that social capital facilitates external knowledge acquisition in key customer relationships and that such knowledge mediates the relationship between social capital and knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage. Our results indicate that the social interaction and network ties dimensions of social capital are indeed associated with greater knowledge acquisition, but that the relationship quality dimension is negatively associated with knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition is, in turn, positively associated with knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage through new product development, technological distinctiveness, and sales cost efficiency. Further, our results provide evidence that knowledge acquisition plays a mediating role between social capital and knowledge exploitation.

Using concepts derived from the international business and entrepreneurship literatures, we develop four hypotheses that relate the extent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and exporting activity, and the relative use of alliances, to the corporate performance of internationalizing SMEs. Using a sample of 164 Japanese SMEs to test these hypotheses, we find that the positive impact of internationalization on performance extends primarily from the extent of a firm's FDI activity. We also find evidence consistent with the perspective that firms face a liability of foreignness. When firms first begin FDI activity, profitability declines, but greater levels of FDI are associated with higher performance. Exporting moderates the relationship FDI has with performance, as pursuing a strategy of high exporting concurrent with high FDI is less profitable than one that involves lower levels of exports when FDI levels are high. Finally, we find that alliances with partners with local knowledge can be an effective strategy to overcome the deficiencies SMEs face in resources and capabilities, when they expand into international markets.

Chains\u2014which operate in dispersed markets\u2014most frequently use this form of governance. These firms must balance the centralization and standardization required for efficiency with the adaptation needed for success in varied local markets. By adopting an organizational learning perspective, we argue that the mix of company-owned and franchised units affects this balance, thereby influencing chain performance. In particular, the different incentives facing company managers and the entrepreneurs that manage franchises encourage distinct patterns of organizational learning. Franchised establishments provide better opportunities for the firm to learn through experimentation; however, companies find it easier to diffuse this information and enforce standards through their company-owned units.

We observe that in e-business new value can be created by the ways in which transactions are enabled. Grounded in the rich data obtained from case study analyses and in the received theory in entrepreneurship and strategic management, we develop a model of the sources of value creation. The model suggests that the value creation potential of e-businesses hinges on four interdependent dimensions, namely: efficiency, complementarities, lock-in, and novelty. Our findings suggest that no single entrepreneurship or strategic management theory can fully explain the value creation potential of e-business. Rather, an integration of the received theoretical perspectives on value creation is needed. To enable such an integration, we offer the business model construct as a unit of analysis for future research on value creation in e-business. A business model depicts the design of transaction content, structure, and governance so as to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. We propose that a firm's business model is an important locus of innovation and a crucial source of value creation for the firm and its suppliers, partners, and customers.

Stories help create competitive advantage for entrepreneurs through focal content shaped by two key forms of entrepreneurial capital: firm-specific resource capital and industry-level institutional capital. We illustrate our ideas with anecdotal entrepreneurial stories that range from contemporary high-technology accounts to the evolution of the mutual fund industry.

Its subjects are the studio heads who ran all the major Hollywood film studios from 1936 to 1965. The study found first, that product line experimentation declines over the course of executive tenures; second, that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between top executive tenure and an organization's financial performance; and third, that product line experimentation is more likely to benefit financial performance late in top executives' tenures. These findings are consistent with a three-stage \u2018executive life cycle\u2019. During the early years of their tenures, top managers experiment intensively with their product lines to learn about their business; later on their accumulated knowledge allows them to reduce experimentation and increase performance; finally, in their last years, executives reduce experimentation still further, and performance declines.

Analyzing 253 horizontal acquisitions, we show that post-acquisition resource redeployment leads to asset divestiture from the business that receives the redeployed resources, but not from the business that contributes the new resources. Consistent with scale economies rationales, we find that strategic similarity also leads to greater asset divestiture from the target firms. Many theoretical perspectives are skeptical about the positive rationale for acquisitions and many of these believe that asset divestiture is evidence of acquisition failure. Our arguments and analysis help refine the accepted wisdom. In particular, the pattern of resource redeployment and asset divestiture in our analysis suggests that acquisitions provide a means of reconfiguring the structure of resources within firms and that asset divestiture is a logical consequence of this reconfiguration process.

In global B2B on-line marketplaces, market microstructures, i.e. which firms compete for the same customers, are thus likely to be influenced by how customers value location and firm capabilities in their decisions to do business with different suppliers on-line. We suggest that both these sets of attributes will continue to matter on-line\u2014firms possessing similar capabilities, as well as firms that are similar in location by country, time zones or clusters, will compete for business from the same customers. We model the similarity in competitive positions between pairs of firms based on the overlap in their customer networks, using data on actual interactions between supplier and customer banks on an electronic trading system. Using QAP network regression techniques on the 100 largest banks in this industry, we find that similarity in capabilities influences who competes with whom, and that location still matters in a global B2B exchange. Interestingly, location influences who a firm's competitors are, but not where its customers are from.

We develop a statistical approach for performing CVA utilizing a recursive simultaneous equation model that is formulated to accommodate buyer heterogeneity.

The owner's investment in the quality of the firm's internal control system and the auditor's effort jointly affect the informativeness of the auditor's report on the firm's financial statements. If the auditor's legal liability to investors is large, then an efficiency loss arises because the owner underinvests in the internal control system and the auditor overinvests effort. On the other hand, if the liability is small, then an efficiency loss arises from the owner's overinvestment and the auditor's underinvestment. Regulators can improve allocative efficiency by changing the auditor's legal liability. However, in our model, it is impossible to completely eliminate the efficiency loss by changing the auditor's liability alone, because no damage award can induce both the owner and auditor to make socially optimal investments in the internal control system and audit effort. We also interpret recent changes in the regulatory environment in the context of our model.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/76/3/333/2634/Strategic-Interaction-in-Auditing-An-Analysis-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['legal liability', 'internal control', 'efficiency loss']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing and legal liability without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We find that firms with relatively more conservative accounting are less likely to make timely voluntary disclosures than firms with less conservative accounting. Therefore, price is more timely in reflecting the news of firms with less conservative accounting. Prior research has assumed that the timeliness by which news is impounded in price is uncorrelated with the nature of accounting earnings and has ascribed a concave earnings\u2010return relation to the accounting system reporting bad news on a more timely basis than good news. In our theory, a concave relation is not necessarily attributable to a difference in the way the accounting system reports good vs. bad news. Rather, our prediction stems from how biases in mandatory financial reports determine which firms optimally choose to make voluntary preemptive disclosures and which do not. Hence, our theory provides an alternative explanation for the empirical findings and cautions against interpreting them as evidence that accounting is conservative.

The optimal agency contract yields more firm profit than a contract that relies exclusively on honest reporting.

Experimental Evidence on the Judgment Performance Effects of Expensing Intangibles","This study shows experimentally that when individuals use information on intangibles expenditures to predict future profits, expensing (vs. capitalizing) the expenditures significantly reduces the accuracy, consistency, consensus, and self\u2010insight of individuals' subjective profit predictions. The experimental design allows us to eliminate several competing explanations for this apparent fixation on accounting. Subjects do not base their judgments on a nai\u00a8ve prior belief that expensing precludes effects on future profits; a preexperiment question shows that subjects expect intangibles expenditures will affect future profits even when expensed. Moreover, subjects do not lack, or fail to use, data that would allow them to learn the exact expenditure\u2010profit relation. They receive data on intangibles expenditures and profits as a basis for learning, and in some respects the learning is quite successful even when intangibles are expensed; subjects' profit predictions accurately reflect the mean and standard deviation of actual profits. Nevertheless, consistent with psychological theories of learning, subjects do not learn the exact magnitude of the effect of intangibles on future profits as well when the intangibles are expensed. Although the mean of their predictions is accurate, they do not discriminate well between cases with high and low actual profits. In consequence, their prediction accuracy, consistency, consensus, and self\u2010insight are lower when intangibles are expensed. Thus, in this case, learning does not mitigate fixation on accounting, because accounting affects the learning process itself.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/76/4/561/2656/Why-Does-Fixation-Persist-Experimental-Evidence-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of accounting practices related to intangibles and does not address any themes related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice.

Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that dilutive securities attenuate the relation between earnings and returns. Estimated earnings response coefficients (ERCs) are significantly lower when there are shares reserved for conversion. The effect is more pronounced for firms that have experienced price increases or positive earnings news, as these increase the expected dilutive effect of conversions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/76/4/589/2640/Earnings-Dilution-and-the-Explanatory-Power-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings dilution and its impact on returns without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In addition, we show that a firm's commitment to a policy of timely disclosure of a broader range of outcomes dampens the slope coefficient on volume in a Taylor expansion of the log of the absolute value of returns on volume. The reason for this is that when a firm commits to a policy of timely disclosure of a broader range of outcomes, the deferral of a report indicates that the outcome is extreme. This heightens adverse selection. In turn, this makes informed trade more costly and hence less likely, thereby rendering returns less dependent on trading volume as a source of information about firm value. This result predicts that firms committing to more disclosure should experience a smaller slope coefficient on trading volume. Thus, the slope coefficient offers a potential tool for measuring the economic consequences of shifts in disclosure regimes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/76/4/633/2654/The-Relation-among-Disclosure-Returns-and-Trading","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial disclosure and trading volume without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Shareholder/managers receive two types of income from the firm they own: compensation income as employees, and investment income as shareholders. Although compensation income is taxable to employees and deductible by employers, investment income is subject to double taxation. Thus, the mix of the two is an important tax\u2010planning decision for management\u2010owned insurers. I predict and find that as individual tax rates increased relative to corporate tax rates from 1989\u20131992 to 1993\u20131996, shareholder/managers paid themselves less tax\u2010deductible compensation relative to a control sample of nonmanagement\u2010owned insurers (i.e., privately held insurers with no managerial ownership).
