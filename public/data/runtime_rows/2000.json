Political order may be provided by the state or through membership in a federation. Independently, both conditions should reduce organizational failure, but when they coexist, the influence of the state should dominate due to its comparative advantages as a supplier of order. Organizations that represent rival ideologies cause ideological competition, which should increase failure, while organizations that represent shared ideologies cause ideological mutualism, which should decrease failure. The context of Israeli workers' cooperatives provides a natural laboratory for testing these ideas, as it spans the formation of the Israeli state.

Results show an effect of innovations on the rate of nonmimetic change in radio markets, with innovations in large or nearby markets having greater effect and innovations by large organizations having less effect.

We test hypotheses based on two seemingly contradictory consequences of aging for organizational innovation: that aging is associated with increases in firms' rates of innovation and that the difficulties of keeping pace with incessant external developments causes firms' innovative outputs to become obsolete relative to the most current environmental demands. These seemingly contradictory outcomes are intimately related and reflect inherent tradeoffs in organizational learning and innovation processes. Multiple longitudinal analyses of the relationship between firm age and patenting behavior in the semiconductor and biotechnology industries lend support to these arguments.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2666980","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'organizational aging', 'patenting']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of organizational aging and innovation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Results show that, although crude, these representations still act as a powerful guide to initial search efforts and usefully constrain the direction of subsequent experiential search. Changing a cognitive representation itself can act as an important mode of adaptation, effectively resulting in the sequential allocation of attention to different facets of the environment.

In three studies, participants indicated their reactions to an exchange with another party as a function of the other party's procedural fairness and the outcome favorability associated with the exchange. In Study 1, participants' national culture was treated as a proxy for their self-construal. In Study 2, people's national culture and self-construal were assessed.

A study of organizations that migrated from the NASDAQ stock market to the New York Stock Exchange reveals that strong ties to in-group members (NASDAQ members) reduced the impact of identity-discrepant cues and diminished defections.

Political ideology and cognitive style emerged as consistent predictors of the value spins that managers placed on decisions at all three levels of analysis. Specifically, conservative managers with strong preferences for cognitive closure were most likely (a) to defend simple heuristic-driven errors such as overattribution and overconfidence and to warn of the mirror-image mistakes of failing to hold people accountable and of diluting sound policies with irrelevant side-objectives; (b) to be skeptical of complex strategies of structuring or coping with accountability and to praise those who lay down clear rules and take decisive stands; (c) to prefer simple philosophies of corporate governance (the shareholder over stakeholder model) and to endorse organizational norms such as hierarchical filtering that reduce cognitive overload on top management by short-circuiting unnecessary argumentation.

Prominent accounts of such behavior depict newly powerful shareholders as having demanded a dismantling of the inefficient, highly diversified corporate strategies that arose in the late 1950s and the 1960s. This paper highlights an additional factor that spurred such divestiture: the need to present a coherent product identity in the stock market. It is argued that because they straddle the industry categories that investors\u2014and securities analysts, who specialize by industry\u2014use to compare like assets, diversified firms hinder efforts at valuing their shares. As a result, managers of such firms face pressure from analysts to dediversify so that their stock is more easily understood. Results indicate that, in addition to such factors as weak economic performance, de-diversification is more likely when a firm's stock price is low and there is a significant mismatch between its corporate strategy and the identity attributed to the firm by analysts.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2667110","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['corporate control', 'diversification', 'shareholders']","The article primarily focuses on corporate strategies and financial performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

These processes may be realized as one or more workflows, each of which is an instantiation of a process under certain conditions. Because an ability to adapt processes to workflow conditions is essential for organizational responsiveness, identifying and analyzing significant workflows is an important activity for managers, organization designers, and information systems specialists. A variety of software systems have been developed to aid in the structuring and implementation of workflow systems, but they are mostly visualization tools with few analytical capabilities. For example, they do not allow their users to easily determine which information elements are needed to compute other information elements, whether certain tasks depend on other tasks, and how resource availability affects information and tasks. Analyses of this type can be performed by inspection, but this gives rise to the possibility of error, especially in large systems.

They are challenged not just to use IT, but to use it as effectively as possible. Understanding how to assess the competence of users is critical in maximizing the effectiveness of IT use. Yet the user competence construct is largely absent from prominent technology acceptance and it models, poorly conceptualized, and inconsistently measured. We begin by presenting a conceptual model of the assessment of user competence to organize and clarify the diverse literature regarding what user competence means and the problems of assessment. As an illustrative study, we then report the findings from an experiment involving 66 participants. The experiment was conducted to compare empirically two methods (paper and pencil tests versus self-report questionnaire), across two different types of software, or domains of knowledge (word processing versus spreadsheet packages), and two different conceptualizations of competence (software knowledge versus self-efficacy). The analysis shows statistical significance in all three main effects. How user competence is measured, what is measured, what measurement context is employed:all influence the measurement outcome. Furthermore, significant interaction effects indicate that different combinations of measurement methods, conceptualization, and knowledge domains produce different results. The concept of frame of reference, and its anchoring effect on subjects' responses, explains a number of these findings. The study demonstrates the need for clarity in both defining what type of competence is being assessed and in drawing conclusions regarding competence, based upon the types of measures used. Since the results suggest that definition and measurement of the user competence construct can change the ability score being captured, the existing information system (IS) models of usage must contain the concept of an ability rating. We conclude by discussing how user competence can be incorporated into the Task-Technology Fit model, as well as additional theoretical and practical implications of our research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.1.37.11782","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['competence', 'assessment', 'effectiveness']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of measuring user competence in information technology, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, few empirical studies have reported the impact of network externalities on the adoption of networks. As a result, little is known about the extent to which network externalities may influence network adoption and diffusion. Using electronic banking as a context and an econometric technique called hazard modeling, this research examines empirically the impact of network externalities and other influences that combine to determine network membership. The results support the network externalities hypothesis. We find that banks in markets that can generate a larger effective network size and a higher level of externalities tend to adopt early, while the size of a bank's own branch network (a proxy for the opportunity cost of adoption)decreases the probability of early adoption.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.1.61.11783","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on network externalities and their impact on network adoption in electronic banking, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The need to conduct cross-cultural research is perhaps even more important in the relatively newly emerging and quickly changing information systems (IS)field. This article presents issues relating to qualitative research, emic versus etic approaches, and describes a structured, yet flexible, qualitative research interviewing technique, which decreases the potential for bias on the part of the researcher. The grounded theory technique presented in this article is based on Kelly's Repertory Grid (RepGrid), which concentrates on \u201claddering,\u201d or the further elaboration of elicited constructs, to obtain detailed researchparticipant comments about an aspect within the domain of discourse. The technique provides structure to a \u201cone-to-one\u201d interview. But, at the same time, RepGrids allow sufficient flexibility for the research participants to be able to express their own interpretation about a particular topic. This article includes a brief outline of a series of research projects that employed the RepGrid technique to examine similarities and differences in the way in which \u201cexcellent\u201d systems analysts are viewed in two different cultures.

Today, however, increasing signs have accumulated that this wisdom might be inadequate in shaping appropriate insights for contemporary practice. This essay seeks to direct research attention toward the following question: How should firms organize their IT activities in order to manage the imperatives of the business and technological environments in the digital economy? We articulate the platform logic as a conceptual framework for both viewing the organizing of IT management activities as well as for framing important questions for future research. In articulating this logic, we aim to shift thinking away from the traditional focus on governance structures (i.e., choice of centralized, decentralized, or federal forms) and sourcing structures (i.e., insourcing, outsourcing) and toward more complex structures that are reflective of contemporary practice. These structures are designed around important IT capabilities and network architectures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.2.105.11780","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on IT organizational architectures and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The psychology literature has portrayed first impression bias as a virtually \u201cinherent\u201d human bias. Drawing from multimedia literature, this study identifies several characteristics of multimedia presentations that have the potential to alleviate first impression bias. Based on this literature, a set of predictions was generated and tested through a laboratory experiment using a simulated multimedia intranet. Half of the 80 subjects were provided with a biased cue. Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: (1) text with first impression bias cue, (2) multimedia with first impression bias cue, (3) text without biased cue, and (4) multimedia without biased cue. The experimental task involved conducting a five-year performance appraisal of a department head. The first impression bias cue was designed to provide incomplete and unfavorable information about the department head, but the information provided subsequently was intended to be favorable of his performance. Results show that the appraisal score of the text with biased cue group was significantly lower than the text only (without biased cue) group. On the other hand, the appraisal score of the multimedia with biased cue group was not significantly different from the multimedia only (without biased cue) group. As a whole, the results suggest that multimedia presentations, but not text-based presentations, reduce the influence of first impression bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.2.115.11776","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['bias', 'first impression', 'multimedia']","The article discusses 'first impression bias' and how multimedia can alleviate it, indicating an awareness of cognitive biases.

The objective of this paper is to determine the form of the production process for information systems services at the firm level by conducting an empirical analysis of IS budget data. The production of information services is modeled using a production function with two inputs, hardware and personnel. We estimate various econometric specifications to determine several characteristics of the provision of information services, including the allocation of the information systems budget to its two largest components\u2014hardware and personnel\u2014and its implications for the form of the production function. After controlling for industry sector, we find that the ratio of personnel to hardware is independent of scale, which indicates a homothetic production function. We also find that the ratio of factor shares is constant with time, consistent with the Cobb-Douglas production function.We conclude that the underlying form of the production function is the same at the level of both the firm and the economy.

These databases provide timely information for delay sensitive users. The proposed approach allows diverse users to optimize their own objectives while collectively maximizing organizational benefits. We rely on economic principles to derive priority prices by modeling the fixed-capacity real-time database environment as an economic system. Each priority is associated with a price and a delay, and the price is the premium (congestion toll resulting from negative externalities) for accessing the database. At optimality, the prices are equal to the aggregate delay cost imposed on all other users of the database. These priority prices are used to control admission and to schedule user jobs in the database system. The database monitors the arrival processes and the state of the system, and incrementally adjusts the prices to regulate the flow. Because our model ignores the operational intricacies of the real-time databases (e.g., intermediate queues at the CPU and disks, memory size, etc.) to maintain analytical tractability, we evaluate the performance of our pricing approach through simulation. We evaluate the database performance using both the traditional real-time database performance metrics (e.g., the number of jobs serviced on time, average tardiness) and the economic benefits (e.g., benefits to the organization). The simulation results, under various database workload parameters, show that our priority pricing mechanism not only maximizes organizational benefits but also outperforms in all aspects of traditional performance measures compared to frequently used database scheduling techniques, such as first-come-first-served, earliest deadline first and least slack first.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.2.177.11781","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['diverse users', 'objectives', 'economic system']","The article discusses user preferences and optimizing objectives for diverse users, indicating a consideration for inclusivity.

The introduction of Windows rendered obsolete the large DOS-based software library that had provided strong positive externalities for the NEC architecture. Absent those advantages, the market share of the PC-98 standard fell from 60% to 33% in five years, and NEC finally abandoned the PC-98 in favor of the global standard.

Many enhancement cost-reduction initiatives have focused on increasing software structure in applications. However, while software structure can decrease enhancement effort by localizing data processing, increased effort is also required to comprehend structure. Thus, it is not clear whether high levels of software structure are economically efficient in all situations. In this study, we develop a model of the relationship between software structure and software enhancement costs and errors. We introduce the notion of software structure as a moderator of the relationship between software volatility, total data complexity, and software enhancement outcomes. We posit that it is efficient to more highly structure the more volatile applications, because increased familiarity with the application structure through frequent enhancement enables localization of maintenance effort. For more complex applications, software structure is more beneficial than for less complex applications because it facilitates the comprehension process where it is most needed. Given the downstream enhancement benefits of structure for more volatile and complex applications, we expect that the optimal level of structure is higher for these applications. We empirically evaluate our model using data collected on the business applications of a major mass merchandiser and a large commercial bank. We find that structure moderates the relationship between complexity, volatility, and enhancement outcomes, such that higher levels of structure are more advantageous for the more complex and more volatile applications in terms of reduced enhancement costs and errors. We also find that more structure is designed in for volatile applications and for applications with higher levels of complexity. Finally, we identify application type as a significant factor in predicting which applications are more volatile and more complex at our research sites. That is, applications with induction-based algorithms such as those that support planning, forecasting, and management decision-making activities are more complex and more volatile than applications with rule-based algorithms that support operational and transaction-processing activities. Our results indicate that high investment in software quality practices such as structured design is not economically efficient in all situations. Our findings also suggest the importance of organizational mechanisms in promoting efficient design choices that lead to reduced enhancement costs and errors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.3.219.12209","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software structure and enhancement costs without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

The perceptual integration process involves establishing interdependence between relevant system elements that have been dispersed across multiple diagrams, while the conceptual integration process involves generating and refining hypotheses about a system by combining higher-level information inferred from the diagrams. This study applies a diagrammatic reasoning framework of a single diagram to assess the usability of multiple diagrams as an integral part of a system development methodology. Our experiment evaluated the effectiveness and usability of design guidelines to aid problem solving with multiple diagrams. The results of our experiment revealed that understanding a system represented by multiple diagrams involves a process of searching for related information and of developing hypotheses about the target system. The results also showed that these perceptual and conceptual integration processes were facilitated by incorporating visual cues and contextual information in the multiple diagrams as representation aids. Visual cues indicate which elements in a diagram are related to elements in other diagrams; the contextual information indicates how the individual datum in one diagram is related to the overall hypothesis about the entire system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.3.284.12206","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processes related to diagrammatic reasoning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is especially true in information technology and telecommunications industries, where multiple product generations and rapid technological evolution continually test the ability of the incumbent to stay ahead of potential entrants. In these industries, an incumbent often protects its position by launching prematurely to retain its leadership. Entry, however, happens relatively frequently. We identify conditions under which an entrant will launch a next generation product thereby preventing the incumbent from employing a protection strategy. We define a capabilities advantage as the ability to develop and launch a next generation product at a lower cost than a competitor, and a product with a greater market response is one with greater profit flows. Using these definitions, we find that an incumbent with a capabilities advantage in one next generation product can be overtaken by an entrant with a capabilities advantage in another next generation product only if the entrant's capabilities advantage is in a disruptive technology that yields a product with a greater market response. This can occur even though both next generation products are available to both firms. We also show that the competition may require the launching firm to lose money at the margin on the next generation product.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.3.304.12208","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market competition and product development without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Postrelease errors, i.e., those that are only observed after a system is released, threaten a variety of potential failures and consequences, each with low individual probability of occurrence. The combined effect of postrelease errors can and often does result in a significant rate of occurrence of these potential failures, with unpredictable consequences and severity.

However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external\u2014conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.11.4.342.11872","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of user acceptance and usability of information technologies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequent specific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period. The emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques.

Immediate recognition is less prevalent among firms with higher potential debt contracting costs.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410101000040","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and their impact on earnings management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As a result, the advertised product is more likely to be included in a stimulus-based consideration set even when the perceptual features of the product under consideration do not match the features of the product depiction in the ad. These results are consistent with conceptual fluency arising from a semantic analysis that occurs during incidental ad exposure. Studies 3 and 4 indicate that when an ad is devoid of other product-related information (i.e., when it simply depicts a product by itself), processing is limited to a simple feature analysis. The effect of this analysis on consideration set judgment is found when the shape of the advertised product is unfamiliar, and the perceptual features of the product under consideration match those of the product depiction in the ad. These results are consistent with the concept of perceptual fluency.

We find that when minimal ad information is provided, self-related thoughts about the past contain more contextual information than self-related thoughts about the future. In study 1, we find that when consumers engage in retrospective self-referencing, providing more contextual information in the ad increases the incidence of self-related thoughts that are discordant with the advertised brand (hereafter, \u201cself-brand discordant thoughts\u201d), decreases self-related thoughts that are concordant with the advertised brand (hereafter, \u201cself-brand concordant thoughts\u201d), and decreases brand attitudes and behavioral intentions. Conversely, when consumers engage in anticipatory self-referencing, providing more contextual information in the ad increases the incidence of contextually detailed thoughts, increases the ability to form consumption visions, increases the incidence of self-brand concordant thoughts without affecting self-brand discordant thoughts, and increases ad and brand attitudes and behavioral intentions. Mediation tests suggest that the effects on brand evaluations are mediated both by the extent to which consumers form brand-related consumption visions and by the extent to which they can link themselves to the advertised brand through concordant thoughts. In study 2 we show that the demonstrated differences between retrospection and anticipation are predicated on self-referencing and are not obtained for other referencing.

The results of the four experiments suggest that when consumers receive initial information in a noncomparative format, a comparative challenge causes a greater degree of revision in the evaluative judgments than does a noncomparative challenge.

A series of hypotheses are developed, modeled, and tested regarding the effects that internal reference points for product category attractiveness are likely to have on the decision to buy in a product category on a store visit. The authors hypothesize that the difference between a shopper's reference point for category attractiveness and the current level of category attractiveness will affect the purchase decision. In particular, the extent of purchase postponement caused by a loss (i.e., a negative discrepancy) should exceed the acceleration caused by a gain (i.e., a positive discrepancy). Reference effects on the category purchase decision are also hypothesized to interact with the shopper's familiarity with the store visited on a given trip. In particular, the impact of losses is predicted to be higher in unfamiliar than in familiar stores.

These concerns appear in discussions of the cultural hierarchy (distinguishing among levels of tastes) and in claims that commercialism tends to degrade cultural objects (by catering to tastes that represent the lowest common denominator). However, such attacks make assumptions that are generally left untested and that raise at least two key research questions: (RQ1) Do the determinants of popular appeal versus expert judgments suggest differing or common standards of evaluation for consumers versus critics? (RQ2) Do discrepant (shared) tastes produce a negative (positive) correlation between popular appeal and expert judgments? The present study addresses these research questions for the case of motion pictures. The findings suggest that, at least in the case of films, ordinary consumers and professional critics do emphasize different criteria in the formation of their tastes but that we have reason to question critiques based on the implicit assumption of a negative correlation between popular appeal and expert judgments.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/26/2/144/1784927","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['cultural hierarchy', 'commercialism', 'tastes']","The article discusses the cultural hierarchy and the impact of commercialism on artistic standards, indicating a moderate engagement with social themes.

Following previous research, expectancy refers to the degree to which an item or a piece of information falls into some predetermined pattern or structure evoked by an ad. Relevancy refers to the degree to which an item or a piece of information contributes to the identification of the primary message communicated by the ad. Across two studies that examined immediate response, we found that information expectancy and relevancy interact to produce different levels of attitude favorability. Although ads with unexpected-relevant information elicited more favorable attitudes than did ads with expected-relevant information, ads with unexpected-irrelevant information yielded less favorable attitudes that did ads with expected-relevant information. Furthermore, humor and relevancy interact where a humorous execution was found to have a favorable effect in ads with unexpected-irrelevant information but not in ads with unexpected-relevant information. In addition, the second study further examined delayed responses in which the findings revealed a different pattern. Particularly noteworthy is a sleeper effect for ads with unexpected-irrelevant information where attitudes for both the ad and the brand improved over time.

These effects were hypothesized to be absent for pictorial information. Two experiments found support for the hypotheses. In a sorting task, native English speakers demonstrated superior temporal memory for English words compared with native Chinese speakers for Chinese words. In a free recall task, native English speakers demonstrated a greater reliance on temporal order in the retrieval of English words, whereas native Chinese speakers demonstrated a greater reliance on semantic associations in the retrieval of Chinese words. In both experiments, cross-cultural differences were absent for semantically equivalent pictorial information.

In the extreme, discounting can take the form of frequent but shallow discounts or deep but infrequent discounts. The research reported here explores the effects of these strategies on consumer estimation of price levels for competing stores and brands. In an initial experiment in which subjects made brand choices over time, a depth effect was observed that contrasted with the frequency effect found in previous research. Subsequent experiments identified the conditions under which depth (vs. frequency) characteristics of price data dominate consumers' price-estimation judgments. Frequency information is more influential when sets of interstore or interbrand comparative prices exhibit complex and overlapping distributions (hence creating processing difficulty); in contrast, a depth bias occurs when prices have a simpler, dichotomous distribution. These results place pragmatically meaningful limitations on the influence of frequency information and illustrate the importance of context in determining consumer price judgments in a promotional environment.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/26/2/99/1784961","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer price judgments and discounting strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although these expatriates identify with dominant cosmopolitan ideals of nomadic mobility and cultural adaptability, their consumer stories reveal a host of countervailing tensions deriving from emotional and interpersonal ties to home, desires for communal affiliations, and enduring preferences for familiar goods and places. We trace the history of colonial and patriarchal meanings that form the ideological underpinnings to these tensions.

Findings across four laboratory experiments indicate that a false-positive outcome increases perceptions of vulnerability and test inaccuracy, even holding constant test-error base rates. Increased perceived vulnerability appears to be directly related to the testing event, as the effects are not replicated by simply asking subjects to imagine having the malady. The findings also show that a false-positive result increases planned compliance if there are poor alternatives to testing or if the value of test-initiated treatment is high but does not affect compliance if good testing alternatives are available or the treatment value is low.

Findings from the two experiments suggest that if processing resources are limited, spontaneously evoked affective reactions rather than cognitions tend to have a greater impact on choice. As a result, the consumer is more likely to choose the alternative that is superior on the affective dimension but inferior on the cognitive dimension (e.g., chocolate cake). In contrast, when the availability of processing resources is high, cognitions related to the consequences of choosing the alternatives tend to have a bigger impact on choice compared to when the availability of these resources is low. As a result, the consumer is more likely to choose the alternative that is inferior on the affective dimension but superior on the cognitive dimension (e.g., fruit salad).

Recent research suggests that the construction of both similarity and preference judgments can be captured by a feature-matching model that allows for shifts in the relative weights assigned to the various features of the alternatives being compared. An implication of this model is that engaging in one comparative process (e.g., similarity) can influence the relative weight assigned to the features that are considered in a second comparative judgment (e.g., preference). Our main proposition that the type and direction of the initial comparison process has a systematic effect on subsequent preference judgments and choice was tested in a series of studies. One study, which focused on alternatives about which consumers have information in memory, shows that the direction of an initial comparison task that elicits differences between two options systematically alters their relative attractiveness in a subsequent preference task. In two subsequent studies, the effect of engaging in an initial comparison task on subsequent preference judgments was tested for stimulus-based choice sets. The results on choice deferral and choice satisfaction were consistent with the notion that engaging in similarity/dissimilarity comparisons altered the relative weight assigned to common and unique features for the two alternatives. Mouselab was used to support the decision mechanisms underlying the effect of the initial similarity/dissimilarity judgments. An additional study examined how the effect of adding common features on subsequent preference was also contingent on the initial comparison task. We conclude with a study involving real consequences and a discussion of the theoretical and practical goals of our findings.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/26/3/293/1815367","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and preference judgments without addressing any social justice themes, ethical considerations, or diversity issues.

Two experiments use open-ended brand-claim recall and cognitive responses to establish that elaboration on the qualified claim and disclosure mediates its utilization in updating quality judgments. Given an impression-formation goal, such elaboration can occur on-line at the time of processing brand information or at the time of judgment, provided that the disclosure is internally or externally available.

Experiment 1 replicates basic findings showing that high culture-distinct associations lead to more favorable attitudes for individuals in the target culture relative to a nontarget culture, while low culture-distinct associations lead to more attitudinal similarities across cultural boundaries. Experiments 2 and 3 explore two potential explanations for these effects. Convergent evidence, provided through within-culture and across-culture mediation analysis, is more supportive of the differential accessibility explanation. That is, high culture-distinct associations may be valued in the nontarget culture but are relatively inaccessible in memory at an individual level. The results of these experiments help to reconcile conflicting findings in the consumer psychology literature, shed insight on why cultural differences might occur, and add to the growing body of research that identifies conditions under which cultural similarities in persuasion processes and effects may be found.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/26/4/340/1803940","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['culture', 'persuasion', 'attitudes', 'associations']","The article explores cultural differences in persuasion processes, indicating an awareness of diversity and how cultural factors influence consumer behavior.

We propose a reasons-based account to explain the valuation of trivial attributes and in particular why valuation is in some cases positive and in others negative. We suggest that consumers treat trivial attributes as though they had value when such valuation is instrumental, that is, helps accomplish a task goal. The valence of the effect can depend on whether a positive or negative reason provides a clearer justification for preferring a single brand over its competitors. Thus the same trivial attribute can generate a positive or negative valuation depending on the choice setting. Such valuation is not always driven by inferences about the attribute itself but can reflect transitory reasoning about the brand as a whole, based on the way it is differentiated from its competitors.

This pattern of effects prevailed in separate studies using two different types of mood manipulations.

Furthermore, the moderating effect of three situation-specific characteristics (outcome valence, status quo preservation, and reversibility of the outcome) is examined.

We find that capital discipline did not prevent large banks from shifting risk onto the safety net. Banks with low capital and debt-to-deposits ratios overcame outside discipline better than other banks. Mandates introduced by 1991 legislation have improved but did not establish full regulatory control over bank risk-shifting incentives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00212","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital regulation and risk management in banking without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

This problem is common among public firms in many countries where the legal system does not effectively protect minority shareholders against oppression by controlling shareholders. We show that even without any explicit corporate governance mechanisms protecting minority shareholders, controlling shareholders can implicitly commit not to expropriate them. Stock prices of such companies are significantly higher and firms are more likely go public because of this reputation effect. Moreover, insiders divest shares gradually over time, at a rate that is negatively related to the degree of moral hazard.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00221","articles","JF","Finance","3","['minority shareholders', 'agency problem', 'moral hazard']","The article discusses the agency problem and the protection of minority shareholders, which touches on ethical considerations in finance.

Negotiated block trades preserve a low level of ownership concentration, inducing more inefficient extraction of private benefits. In contrast, public acquisitions increase ownership concentration, resulting in fewer private benefits and higher firm value. Within our model, the incumbent and new controlling party prefer to trade the block because of the dispersed shareholders' free-riding behavior. We also explore the regulatory implications of this agency problem and its impact on the terms of block trades.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00222","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on agency conflicts and transaction modes in corporate control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Systematic skewness is economically important and commands a risk premium, on average, of 3.60 percent per year. Our results suggest that the momentum effect is related to systematic skewness.

It finds that impact factors are affected by citations outside the finance field, are not affected by the distribution of published articles across subfields, and are good predictors of the long-term citation counts of articles. The citation impact factors are reduced for both the Journal of Financial Economics and The Journal of Finance by their publication of other than regular articles.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00254","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on citation counts and impact factors in finance journals, with no mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

Seven distinct measures of trading friction are computed from transactions data for 1,706 NYSE/AMSE stocks and 2,184 Nasdaq stocks. The measures provide insights into the magnitude of trading costs, the importance of informational versus real frictions, and the role of market structure. The degree to which the various measures are associated with each other and with trading characteristics of stocks is examined.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00259","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical measures of trading friction and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2000","55","4","John Y.

The emphasis is on the interplay between theory and empirical work and on the trade-off between risk and return. Modern research seeks to understand the behavior of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) that prices all assets in the economy. The behavior of the term structure of real interest rates restricts the conditional mean of the SDF, whereas patterns of risk premia restrict its conditional volatility and factor structure. Stylized facts about interest rates, aggregate stock prices, and cross-sectional patterns in stock returns have stimulated new research on optimal portfolio choice, intertemporal equilibrium models, and behavioral finance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00260","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of asset pricing, risk, and return without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

The subperiod 1969 to 1980 saw a dizzying pace of development with seminal ideas in derivatives securities pricing, term structure theory, asset pricing, and optimal consumption and portfolio choices. During the period 1981 to 1999 the theory has been extended and modified to better explain empirical regularities in various subfields of finance. This latter subperiod has seen significant progress in econometric theory, computational and estimation methods to test and implement continuous-time models.

Research on bankruptcy and privatization suggests using non-cash auctions to increase cash-constrained bidder participation. We examine this proposal and demonstrate that securities may lead to higher revenue. However, bidders pool unless bids include debt, which results in possible repossession by the seller. This suggests all-equity outcomes are unlikely and explains the high debt of reorganized firms. Securities also inefficiently determine bidders' incentive contracts and the firm's capital structure.

One result is that at some date, and at all dates thereafter, the market would have been more informationally efficient had there been a monopolist informed trader instead of competing traders. The relatively large amount of private information remaining near the end of trading causes the market to approach complete illiquidity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00282","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition among informed traders and market efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2000","55","5","Cheol Park,\u00a0\n                     Cheol ParkDepartment of Finance, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The main idea is that the optimal debt contract delegates monitoring to a single senior lender and that seniority allows the monitoring senior lender to appropriate the full return from his monitoring activities. The theory explains (i) why debt contracts are prioritized, (ii) why short-term debt is senior to long-term debt, and (iii) why financial intermediaries usually hold short-term senior debt whereas long-term junior debt is widely held. Another implication of the theory is that covenant and maturity structures will be set to conform to the seniority structure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00283","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt contracts and moral hazard without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We document a two-day acquirer abnormal return of 1.2 percent and a mean cumulative abnormal return of 5.4 percent for the duration of the takeover. Announcement returns display a strong positive association with the strength of acquirer's relationships with banks. The benefits of bank relations appear to be greater for firms with poor investment opportunities and when the banking sector is healthy.

We find that this continues to be true in the presence of realistic transaction costs. In particular, predictability causes the no-trade region for the risky-asset holding to become state dependent and, on average, wider and higher. Predictability also motivates the investor to spend considerably more on rebalancing and to rebalance more often. In other results, we find that introducing costly liquidation of the risky asset for consumption lowers the average allocation to the risky asset, though only marginally early in life. Our experiments also vary the nature of the return predictability and introduce return heteroskedasticity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00287","shorter papers","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically predictability and transaction costs, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Under the manager's optimal policy, the option ends up either deep in or deep out of the money. As the asset value goes to zero, volatility goes to infinity. However, the option compensation does not strictly lead to greater risk seeking. Sometimes, the manager's optimal volatility is less with the option than it would be if he were trading his own account.

Much has been made of this distinction in both the popular and the academic literature, where gains from hostile takeovers result from replacing incumbent managers and gains from friendly takeovers result from strategic synergies. Alternatively, hostility could reflect strategic choices made by the bidder or the target. Empirical tests show that most deals described as hostile in the press are not distinguishable from friendly deals in economic terms, except that hostile transactions involve publicity as part of the bargaining process.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00301","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the economic distinctions between hostile and friendly takeovers, lacking any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The results challenge arguments that cash auctions, as compared to reorganizations, are immune to conflicts of interest between claimholders but lead to inefficient liquidations. I show that a sale of the assets back to incumbent management is a common bankruptcy outcome. Sale-backs are more likely when they favor the bank at the expense of other creditors. On the other hand, inefficient liquidations are frequently avoided through sale-backs when markets are illiquid, that is, when industry indebtedness is high and the firm has few nonspecific assets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00302","articles","JF","Finance","2","['conflicts of interest', 'bankruptcy', 'inefficient liquidations']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of bankruptcy auctions and market dynamics, with minimal reference to social justice or ethical considerations.

In this paper, I argue that in the real world, the identity and reliability of potential exchange partners are seldom the data that most economists take them to be. In fact, firms confront formidable problems of search and deliberation. In these circumstances, firms' social networks can provide a key recourse. Yet, for historical reasons, most firms' social networks still tend to be local or national. And, absent institutional solutions, even in the face of apparent cross-border economic opportunities, firms' responses appear overly sticky and lagged. I explore these arguments in an empirical study that contrasts multinational and domestic firms' trade responses to changes in real exchange rates.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490902","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['identity', 'social networks', 'globalization']","The article discusses the role of identity and social networks in international exchange, but it primarily focuses on economic behaviors rather than social justice or equity themes.

The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the new products and alliance literature. A construct\u2014cooperative competency\u2014derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment, absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether it is an intra- or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and replicate it in the health care sector. The antecedents of cooperative competency\u2014formalized and clannish administration, mutual dependence, and institutional support\u2014are revealed empirically and substantiated.

Firms are increasingly using cross-functional teams for product development in hopes of improving product quality, yet researchers know little about how such teams affect quality. The author proposes and tests a series of hypotheses regarding how new product quality is affected by team characteristics (functional diversity and information integration) and contextual influences (time pressure, product innovativeness from the firm's perspective, customers\u2019 influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm). The findings reveal that quality is positively related to information integration in the team, customers\u2019 influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm. New product quality is negatively influenced by the innovativeness of the new product from the firm's perspective. However, information integration mitigates the negative effect of innovativeness on quality. Quality orientation weakens the relationship between information integration and quality.

However, little research has addressed the question of how the orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm. This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e., formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that there are three \u201ccorridors of influence\u201d between customer-oriented strategy and shared employee values. The dominant corridor, which focuses on dual (management- and employee-initiated) control, emphasizes the importance of work group socialization and organizational commitment in the dissemination of customer-oriented strategy. A secondary corridor focuses on two management-initiated control mechanisms: formalization and behavior-based evaluation. The final corridor, which focuses on the empowerment of customer contact employees, has a more limited impact than originally hypothesized.

Currently, two schools of thought dominate the debate on these fees. One considers them a tool for improving distribution efficiency, whereas the other proposes that the fees operate as a mechanism for enhancing market power and damaging competition. Managers and public policymakers are uncertain as to the effects of slotting fees and the appropriate strategy to adopt. The current study attempts to inform the debate surrounding slotting fees and provide guidance to managers and policymakers. The authors summarize the arguments of the two schools and investigate the views of managers toward them through a large-scale survey of manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer grocery institutions. Though exploratory, the findings suggest that slotting fees shift the risk of new product introductions and help apportion the demand and supply of new products. The authors find that slotting fees are also associated with the exercise of retailer market power, are applied in a discriminatory fashion, and lead to higher retail prices.

Incumbency, Size, and Radical Product Innovation","A common perception in the field of innovation is that large, incumbent firms rarely introduce radical product innovations. Such firms tend to solidify their market positions with relatively incremental innovations. They may even turn away entrepreneurs who come up with radical innovations, though they themselves had such entrepreneurial roots. As a result, radical innovations tend to come from small firms, the outsiders. This thesis, which we term the \u201cincumbent's curse,\u201d is commonly accepted in academic and popular accounts of radical innovation. This topic is important, because radical product innovation is an engine of economic growth that has created entire industries and brought down giants while catapulting small firms to market leadership. Yet a review of the literature suggests that the evidence for the incumbent's curse is based on anecdotes and scattered case studies of highly specialized innovations. It is not clear if it applies widely across several product categories. The authors reexamine the incumbent's curse using a historical analysis of a relatively large number of radical innovations in the consumer durables and office products categories. In particular, the authors seek to answer the following questions: (1) How prevalent is this phenomenon? What percentage of radical innovations do incumbents versus nonincumbents introduce? What percentage of radical innovations do small firms versus large firms introduce? (2) Is the phenomenon a curse that invariably afflicts large incumbents in current industries? Is it driven by incumbency or size? and (3) How consistent is the phenomenon? Has the increasing size and complexity of firms over time accentuated it? Does it vary across national boundaries?

Sales call anxiety is an irrepressible fear of being negatively evaluated and rejected by a customer, and it is coupled with a desire to avoid undertaking specific functional actions in selling situations. The authors present and test a model of SCA in two selling situations known to have threatening consequences for salespeople: canvasing and closing. The authors find that SCA consists of four components: negative self-evaluations, negative evaluations from customers, awareness of physiological symptoms (e.g., a queasy stomach, shaky voice, blushing), and protective actions (e.g., avoiding eye contact, fiddling with the hands, shunning self-disclosures).

It is beneficial, in general, to serve customers over a longer time, especially in a contractual relationship. However, it is not clear whether some of the findings observed in a contractual setting hold good in noncontractual scenarios: relationships between a seller and a buyer that are not governed by a contract or membership. The authors offer four different propositions in this study and subsequently test each one in a noncontractual context. The four propositions relate to whether (1) there exists a strong positive customer lifetime\u2013profitability relationship, (2) profits increase over time, (3) the costs of serving long-life customers are less, and (4) long-life customers pay higher prices. The authors develop arguments both for and against each of the propositions.

Building on transaction costs arguments and related work in marketing, the authors analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty and show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. The authors use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test the hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty. Conversely, vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties when firms adapt to high environmental uncertainty and specific investments are substantial.

To address the second question, the authors develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues that a sales promotion's effectiveness is determined by the utilitarian or hedonic nature of the benefits it delivers and the congruence these benefits have with the promoted product. Among other results, two choice experiments show that, as predicted for high-equity brands, monetary promotions are more effective for utilitarian products than for hedonic products. The authors then discuss the implications of the multibenefit and the benefit congruency frameworks for understanding consumer responses to sales promotions, reexamining the value of everyday-low-price policies, and designing more effective sales promotions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.64.4.65.18071","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['consumer benefits', 'sales promotion', 'utilitarian', 'hedonic']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and the effectiveness of sales promotions without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent. In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.37.1.16.18723","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market share dynamics and retailer distribution without addressing any socially progressive themes, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Building on research on elaboration, the authors propose that the relative salience of hedonic dimensions is greater when consumers decide which of several items to give up (forfeiture choices) than when they decide which item to acquire (acquisition choices). The resulting hypothesis that a hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices was supported in two choice experiments. In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership. Finally, consistent with the experimental findings, a field survey showed that, relative to market prices, owners of relatively hedonic cars value their vehicles more than do owners of relatively utilitarian cars.

The second model form captures individual heterogeneity by postulating that the brand-choice probabilities follow a Dirichlet distribution, which yields the popular Dirichlet multinomial formulation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with a view toward assessing whether individual transition probabilities can be captured from knowledge of only aggregated brand choices.

To accomplish this goal, the authors introduce a new method called sliced inverse regression (SIR), which finds factors by taking into account the information contained in both the dependent and independent variables. Sliced inverse regression objectively identifies appropriate factors through simple statistical tests for determining the number of factors to retain and for assessing the significance of factor-loading coefficients. The authors make conceptual connections between SIR and several existing approaches, including principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Using Monte Carlo experiments, the authors demonstrate that SIR performs better than these approaches. Two empirical examples\u2014designing a new executive business program and direct marketing by a catalog company\u2014are presented to illustrate the application of SIR and to show that it outperforms both PLSR and PCR in these cases. In addition, the authors discuss how direct marketers can apply SIR to analyze large databases and to thus target customers effectively.

Currently, the most efficient algorithm for BKP transforms the data instance to an equivalent 0-1 Knapsack Problem, which is solved efficiently through a specialized algorithm. However, this paper demonstrates that the transformation introduces many similarly weighted items, resulting in very hard instances of the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. To avoid these problems, we propose a specialized algorithm that solves an expanding core problem through dynamic programming such that the number of enumerated item types is minimal. Sorting and reduction is done by need, resulting in very little effort for the preprocessing. Compared to other algorithms for BKP, the presented algorithm uses tighter reductions and enumerates considerably less item types.

In real-life applications, certain measures like the use of additional manpower, the assignment of highly-skilled personnel to specific jobs, or the substitution of equipment are often considered as means of increasing the probability of meeting a due date and thus avoiding penalty costs. This paper investigates the problem of selecting, from a set of possible measures of this kind, the combination of measures that is the most cost-efficient. Assuming stochastic activity durations, the computation of the optimal combination of measures may be very expensive in terms of runtime. In this article, we introduce a powerful stochastic optimization approach to determine a set of efficient measures that crash selected activities in a stochastic activity network. Our approach modifies the conventional Stochastic Branch-and-Bound, using a heuristic\u2014instead of exact methods\u2014to solve the deterministic subproblem. This modification spares computational time and by doing so provides an appropriate method for solving various related applications of combinatorial stochastic optimization.

The implementation of a GRASP for the matrix decomposition problem is described in detail. Extensive computational experiments on literature and randomly generated problems are reported. Moreover, we propose a new procedure Reactive GRASP, in which the basic parameter that defines the restrictiveness of the candidate list during the construction phase is self-adjusted according to the quality of the solutions previously found. The approach is robust and does not require calibration efforts. On most of the literature problems considered, the new Reactive GRASP heuristic matches the optimal solution found by an exact column-generation with branch-and-bound algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.12.3.164.12639","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They offered these market split instances as a challenge to the integer programming community. The market split problem can be formulated as a system of linear diophantine equations in 0-1 variables. In our study we use the algorithm of Aardal, Hurkens, and Lenstra (1998) based on lattice basis reduction. This algorithm is not restricted to deal with market split instances only but is a general method for solving systems of linear diophantine equations with bounds on the variables. We show computational results from solving both feasibility and optimization versions of the market split instances with up to 7 equations and 60 variables and discuss various branching strategies and their effect on the number of enumerated nodes. To our knowledge, the largest feasibility and optimization instances solved before had 6 equations and 50 variables, and 4 equations and 30 variables, respectively. We also present a probabilistic analysis describing how to compute the probability of generating infeasible market split instances. By generating instances the way prescribed by Cornu\u00e9jols and Dawande, one obtains relatively many feasible instances for sizes larger than 5 equations and 40 variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.12.3.192.12635","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of linear programming and algorithmic solutions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this work, we focus on the development of complete and computationally efficient steady-state solutions of queues with power-tailed interarrival times when the service times are assumed exponential. The classical method for obtaining the steady-state probabilities and delay-time distributions for the G/M/1 (G/M/c) queue requires solving a root-finding problem involving the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the interarrival-time distribution function. Then the exponential service assumption is combined with the derived geometric arrival-point probabilities to get both the limiting general-time state and delay distributions. However, in situations where there is a power tail, the interarrival transform is typically quite complicated and never analytically tractable. In addition, it is possible that there is only a degenerate steady-state system-size probability distribution. Thus, an alternative approach to obtaining a steady-state solution is typically needed when power-tailed interarrivals are present. We exploit the exponentiality of the steady-state delay distributions for the G/M/1 and G/M/c queues, using level-crossings and a transform approximation method, to develop an alternative root-finding problem when there are power-tailed interarrival times. Extensive computational results are given.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.12.4.261.11882","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue analysis and computational methods without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The Revised Simplex Search (RSS) procedure consists of a three-phase application of the NM method in which: (a) the ending values for one phase become the starting values for the next phase; (b) the step size for the initial simplex (respectively, the shrink coefficient) decreases geometrically (respectively, increases linearly) over successive phases; and (c) the final estimated optimum is the best of the ending values for the three phases. To compare RSS versus NM and procedure RS+S9 due to Barton and Ivey, we summarize a simulation study based on four selected performance measures computed for six test problems that include additive white-noise error, with three levels of problem dimensionality and noise variability used in each problem. In the selected test problems, RSS yielded significantly more accurate estimates of the optimum than NM or RS+S9, and both RSS and RS+S9 required roughly four times as many function evaluations as NM.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.12.4.272.11879","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization methods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Given several rings of this type, the problem is to find an assignment of nodes to possibly multiple rings, and to determine what portion of demand traffic between node pairs spanned by each ring should be allocated to that ring. The constraints require that the demand traffic between each node pair should be satisfiable given the ring capacities, and that no more than a specified maximum number of nodes should be assigned to each ring. The objective function is to minimize the total number of node-to-ring assignments, and hence, the capital investment in add-drop multiplexer equipments. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming model, and propose several alternative modeling techniques designed to improve the mathematical representation of this problem. We then develop various classes of valid inequalities for the problem along with suitable separation procedures for tightening the representation of the model, and accordingly, prescribe an algorithmic approach that coordinates tailored routines with a commercial solver (CPLEX). We also propose a heuristic procedure which enhances the solvability of the problem and provides bounds within 5\u201313% of the optimal solution. Promising computational results are presented that exhibit the viability of the overall approach and that lend insights into various modeling and algorithmic constructs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.12.4.284.11884","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical problem related to network design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Third, this research suggests that competitive strategy acts as a mediator between an organization's environment and its manufacturing strategy.

In particular, the use and effectiveness of various technologies and their computer-based integration are investigated in the light of three emerging principles: (i) strategic multi-focusedness, (ii) process integration across functions, and (iii) process ownership. Together, these principles are referred to as Strategically Flexible Production (SFP). In an international sample of 392 manufacturing units from the metal-working industry, the use of AMT is analyzed in three groups: core adopters, partial adopters or non-adopters of SFP. Data show that while core adopters do not use stand-alone AMT more than the other groups, they have a higher level of computer integration (CI), in particular in their forefront departments. However, the use of integrating technologies varies much within the core adopters, suggesting that SFP does not necessarily require massive information technology (IT) support. This is further confirmed by the analysis of performance improvements. The mere adoption of stand-alone AMT per se does not provide companies with superior improvements in performance. On the contrary, SFP alone or combined with a higher level of integration of stand-alone AMT fosters increased time responsiveness.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2899%2900022-4","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of advanced manufacturing technologies and their integration within production systems, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition, this paper provides a link between the resource-based view of organizations that has gained some prominence in the strategy literature and the proposed theory of performance frontiers. This paper argues that the operating frontiers of organizations represent unique resources and they are more important than the asset frontiers in achieving a competitive advantage because these unique resources are valuable, rare and specific to a given firm, and they are difficult to replicate. Future research directions and research methods focusing on the internal resources of competitive advantage are also discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2899%2900024-8","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on extending a theoretical framework related to operations management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Yet, most of these studies are either conceptual in nature or actual case studies. The primary objective of this research is to test the impact of a supply management orientation (SMO) on the suppliers' operational performance and buyers' competitive priorities (cost, quality, delivery, flexibility). Three major research hypotheses associated with SMO, Supplier Performance (SP), and Buyer Performance (BP) are tested using a confirmatory structural equation modeling approach. The results of this research support the conclusion that an improvement (increase) in the SMO improves both the suppliers' and buyers' performance (i.e., a win\u2013win situation for the supply chain). In addition, the influence of SMO on delivery- and quality-related performance is more statistically significant than on cost or flexibility performance. In fact, when volume and process flexibility are top competitive priorities, a supply chain management orientation may not be an effective way to achieve the desired flexibility. The article ends by discussing other conclusions and suggests directions for future research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2899%2900031-5","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supply management', 'performance', 'quality']","The article primarily focuses on supply management and performance metrics without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

This empirical study evaluates the operational efficiencies of 44 major U.S. airports using data envelopment analysis and some of its recent developments. Various airport characteristics are evaluated to determine their relationship to an airport's efficiency. Efficiency measures are based on four resource input measures including airport operational costs, number of airport employees, gates and runways, and five output measures including operational revenue, passenger flow, commercial and general aviation movement, and total cargo transportation.

That is, a store that combines high product variety with a small footprint. Retail management desires smaller stores to provide the strategic benefits of convenience and speed to customers, but desires larger stores to provide high product variety. Noting the benefits of smaller, more numerous stores, several retailers well known for their extremely large store size recently have begun experimenting with a small store format. Traditional retail inventory management policies, however, have difficulty combining high variety and small store size. Here, the potential advantages of the dense store type are explored. To facilitate this exploration, inventory policies are developed to help manage small stores by increasing their product density. Results based on grocery industry data indicate that the heuristics compare favorably to optimality and permit the dense store concept to potentially achieve substantial gains compared to current practice.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2899%2900033-9","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail inventory management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Stochastic patient demands for these beds and stochastic service times in their utilization make managing that resource a complex problem lacking an easy solution. The current practice in one Hong Kong hospital is for the ICU administrator to exploit the fact that there are some patients whose admission to the unit can be postponed. These are patients scheduled for an elective surgery that can be cancelled. One way to minimize the number of cancelled surgeries is to reserve some of the unit's beds for the exclusive use of the elective-surgery patients. We evaluate various bed-reservation schemes via a simulation model that is based on this ICU's historical data, and demonstrate the tradeoffs that each requires among various relevant system-performance measures. We further show how this information can be summarized in a classic efficient frontier. This frontier provides a useful medium through which the ICU administrator can communicate the rationale behind the chosen bed-allocation system to the surgeons and the ICU physicians, in an attempt to resolve the potential conflicts between them.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900027-9","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bed allocation in an ICU without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2000","18","4","Mohan V Tatikonda,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Mohan V Tatikonda\n                     \n                        mohan_tatikonda@unc.edu\n                     \n                     Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, McColl Building, Carroll Hall, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3490, USACorresponding author.

A cross-sectional survey sample of 120 completed new product development projects from a variety of assembled products industries is analyzed via hierarchical moderated regression. We find that the project execution methods are positively associated with project execution success. Further, these methods are effective singly and collectively, suggesting that firms can \u201cbalance firmness and flexibility\u201d in product development via appropriate execution methods. Surprisingly, the effectiveness of these methods is not contingent on the product or process technology novelty inherent in a given development project. The findings suggest that firms should adopt high levels of these approaches, and that a variety of projects can be managed using broadly similar project execution methods. The findings also suggest limitations on the application of organizational information processing theory to the context of product development projects.

Minor accidents can interfere with production in a variety of ways, and a serious accident can shut down an entire operation. In this context, questions about the causes of workplace accidents are highly relevant. There is a popular notion that employees' unsafe acts are the primary causes of workplace accidents, but a number of authors suggest a perspective that highlights influences from operating and social systems. The study described herein addresses this subject by assessing steelworkers' responses to a survey about social, technical, and personal factors related to safe work behaviors. Results provide evidence that a chain reaction of technical and social constructs operate through employees to influence safe behaviors. These results demonstrate that safety hazards, safety culture, and production pressures can influence safety efficacy and cavalier attitudes, on a path leading to safe or unsafe work behaviors. Based on these results, we conclude with prescriptions for operations managers and others who play roles in the causal sequence.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900033-4","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['social responsibility', 'safety culture', 'social systems']","The article discusses social responsibility and the influence of social systems on workplace safety, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in operations management.

They are drastically different in their targets of improvement, visibility, and techniques. In this paper, we establish a framework for identifying the synergistic linkages of design and process management to the operational quality outcomes during the manufacturing process (internal quality) and upon the field usage of the products (external quality). Through a study of quality practices in 418 manufacturing plants from multiple industries, we empirically demonstrate that both design and process management efforts have an equal positive impact on internal quality outcomes such as scrap, rework, defects, performance, and external quality outcomes such as complaints, warranty, litigation, market share. A detailed contingency analysis shows that the proposed model of synergies between design and process management holds true for large and small firms; for firms with different levels of TQM experience; and in different industries with varying levels of competition, logistical complexity of production, or production process characteristics. Finally, the results also suggest that organizational learning enables mature TQM firms to implement both design and process efforts more rigorously and their synergy helps these firms to attain better quality outcomes. These findings indicate that, to attain superior quality outcomes, firms need to balance their design and process management efforts and persevere with long-term implementation of these efforts. Because the study spans all of the manufacturing sectors (SIC 20 through 39), these conclusions should help firms in any industry revisit their priorities in terms of the relative efforts in design management and process management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900029-2","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of design and process management in manufacturing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper explores and develops the concept of enterprise logistics [Greis, N.P., Kasarda, J.D., 1997. Enterprise logistics in the information age. California Management Review 39 (3), 55\u201378] as a tool for integrating the logistics activities both within and between the strategically aligned organizations of the extended enterprise. Specifically, this paper examines the fit between an organization's enterprise logistics integration capabilities and its supply chain structure. Using a configurations approach, we test whether globally dispersed network organizations that adopt enterprise logistics practices are able to achieve higher levels of organizational performance. Results indicate that enterprise logistics is a necessary tool for the coordination of supply chain operations that are geographically dispersed around the world. However, for a pure network structure, a high level of enterprise logistics integration alone does not guarantee improved organizational performance. The paper ends with a discussion of managerial implications and directions for future research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2800%2900035-8","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['logistics', 'supply chain', 'organizational performance']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of logistics and supply chain management without addressing social issues or ethical considerations.

The typology links strategic operational objectives to the decision to de-couple work between the front and back offices of a service system. Four specific ideal types of a strategy/de-coupling mix are described; each of which has distinct operational, marketing and human resource ramifications. A type that has had significant representation in traditional literature is the \u201cCost Leader\u201d type, where back-office activities are de-coupled from the front office for the purpose of lowering costs. Another traditional type representative of the craftsman legacy is the \u201cPersonal Service\u201d type, which retains back-office tasks in the front office to pursue non-cost-oriented strategic goals. Theoretical and empirical evidence is also given for two non-traditional types: the \u201cKiosk\u201d type, where all tasks remain in the front office to achieve lower costs, and the \u201cFocused Professional\u201d type, which de-couples front- and back-office activities to enable front-office workers to provide higher service, rather than to reduce costs.

This paper presents findings from a study which investigated the influence of several factors on the social dimension of alignment within 10 business units in the Canadian life insurance industry. The social dimension of alignment refers to the state in which business and IT executives understand and are committed to the business and IT mission, objectives, and plans. \n\nThe research model included four factors that would potentially influence alignment: (1) shared domain knowledge between business and IT executives, (2) IT implementation success, (3) communication between business and IT executives, and (4) connections between business and IT planning processes. The outcome, alignment, was operationalized in two ways: the degree of mutual understanding of current objectives (short-term alignment) and the congruence of IT vision (long-term alignment) between business and IT executives. \n\nA total of 57 semi-structured interviews were held with 45 informants. Written business and IT strategic plans, minutes from IT steering committee meetings, and other strategy documents were collected and analyzed from each of the 10 business units. \n\nAll four factors in the model (shared domain knowledge, IT implementation success, communication between business and IT executives, and connections between business and IT planning) were found to influence short-term alignment. Only shared domain knowledge was found to influence long-term alignment. A new factor, strategic business plans, was found to influence both short and long-term alignment. \n\nThe findings suggest that both practitioners and researchers should direct significant effort toward understanding shared domain knowledge, the factor which had the strongest influence on the alignment between IT and business executives.

What emerged from the positivist analysis was the conclusion of effective group behavior directed toward consensus around alternative solution scenarios. What emerged from the interpretive analysis was evidence of multiple, rich types of information at three levels: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. The interpretive analysis also uncovered the absence of shared consciousness about the issue and imbalanced participation in the sessions.

Published studies suggest that failing software projects are often allowed to continue for too long before appropriate management action is taken to discontinue or redirect the efforts.

What prior studies fail to consider is how concepts from risk-taking theory (such as risk propensity and risk perception) affect decision makers\u2019 willingness to continue a project under conditions of sunk cost. To better understand factors that may cause decision makers to continue such projects, this study examines the level of sunk cost together with the risk propensity and risk perception of decision makers. These factors are assessed for cross-cultural robustness using matching laboratory experiments carried out in three cultures (Finland, the Netherlands, and Singapore). \n\nWith a wider set of explanatory factors than prior studies, we could account for a higher amount of variance in decision makers\u2019 willingness to continue a project. The level of sunk cost and the risk perception of decision makers contributed significantly to their willingness to continue a project. Moreover, the risk propensity of decision makers was inversely related to risk perception. This inverse relationship was significantly stronger in Singapore (a low uncertainty avoidance culture) than in Finland and the Netherlands (high uncertainty avoidance cultures).

In such an environment, IT human capital has assumed considerable significance. Insightful IT leaders recognize that the greatest impediments to success are often related to people rather than to information, technology, and systems. What is not quite clear to IT leaders, however, is exactly how to develop and leverage this human capital in support of business needs. The transformation of IT from a back-office support role to a strategic business partner requires new roles and competencies for IT leaders and professionals. Key challenges for IT leaders are to envision these roles and competencies and to develop and implement programs to translate this vision to reality.

Thus, the investor is faced with the problem of valuing \"implementation opportunities.\" We then compare different valuation techniques for this task and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

Through de-escalation, troubled projects may be successfully turned around or sensibly abandoned.  This study seeks to understand the process of de-escalation and to establish a model for turning around troubled projects that has both theoretical and practical significance.  Through a longitudinal case study of the IT-based baggage handling system at Denver International Airport (DIA), we gathered qualitative data on the de-escalation of commitment to a failing course of action, allowing us to inductively develop a model of the de-escalation process as it unfolded at DIA.  The model reveals de-escalation as a four-phase process:  (1) problem recognition, (2) re-examination of prior course of action, (3) search for alternative course of action, and (4) implementing an exit strategy.  For each phase of the model, we identified key activities that may enable de-escalation to move forward.

Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories.  In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software. Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of\ntemporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use:  perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.  In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption. Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed.

The behavior that underlies many runaway systems can best be characterized as \u201cescalation of commitment to a failing course of action.\u201d  The objectives of this study were to: (1) understand the extent to which IS projects are prone to escalate, (2) compare the outcomes of projects that escalate with those that do not, and (3) test whether constructs associated with different theories of escalation can be used to discriminate between projects that escalate and those that do not. A survey was administered to IS audit and control professionals and, to establish a baseline for comparison, the survey was designed to gather data on projects that did not escalate as well as those that did escalate.\n\nThe results of our research suggest that between 30% and 40% of all IS projects exhibit some degree of escalation. Projects that escalated had project outcomes that were significantly worse in terms of perceived implementation performance and perceived budget/schedule performance, as compared to projects that did not escalate. Using constructs from theories that have been used to explain the escalation phenomenon, we were able to test various logistic regression models for their ability to discriminate between projects that escalate and those that do not. To construct our models, we explored constructs derived from self-justification theory, prospect theory, agency theory, and approach avoidance theory. While constructs derived from all four theories were significant in logistic regression models, the completion effect construct derived from approach avoidance theory provided the best classification of projects, correctly classifying over 70% of both escalated and non-escalated projects.","https://misq.umn.edu/why-software-projects-escalate-an-empirical-analysis-and-test-of-four-theoretical-models.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software project management and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just as is the case for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf.

In this research we examine both theoretically and experimentally how the type of an alliance and the prescribed profit-sharing arrangement affect the resource commitments of partners. We model the interaction within an alliance as a noncooperative variable-sum game, in which each firm invests part of its resources to increase the utility of a new product offering. Different types of alliances are modeled by varying how the resources committed by partners in an alliance determine the utility of the jointly-developed new product. We then model the interalliance competition by nesting two independent intra-alliance games in a supergame in which the groups compete for a market. The partners of the winning alliance share the profits in one of two ways: equally or proportionally to their investments. The Nash equilibrium solutions for the resulting games are examined.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.19.2.105.11804","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic alliances and profit-sharing arrangements without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Print advertising is a major communication instrument for advertisers, but print media have become cluttered with advertisements for brands. Therefore, it has become difficult to attract and keep consumers' attention. Advertisements that fail to gain and retain consumers' attention cannot be effective, but attention is not sufficient: Advertising needs to leave durable traces of brands in memory. Eye movements are eminent indicators of visual attention. However, what is currently missing in eye movementresearch is a serious account of the processing that takes place to store information in long-term memory. We attempt to provide such an account through the development of a formal model. We model the process by which eye fixations on print advertisements lead to memory for the advertised brands, using a hierarchical Bayesian model, but, rather than postulating such a model as a mere data-analysis tool, we derive it from substantive theory on attention and memory. The model is calibrated to eye-movement data that are collected during exposure of subjects to ads in magazines, and subsequent recognition of the brand in a perceptual memory task. During exposure to the ads we record the frequencies of fixations on three ad elements; brand, pictorial and text and, during the memory task, the accuracy and latency of memory. Thus, the available data for each subject consist of the frequency of fixations on the ad elements and the accuracy and the latency of memory. The model that we develop is grounded in attention and memory theory and describes information extraction and accumulation during ad exposure and their effect on the accuracy and latency of brand memory. In formulating it, we assume that subjects have different eye-fixation rates for the different ad elements, because of which a negative binomial model of fixation frequency arises, and we specify the influence of the size of the ad elements. It is assumed that the number of fixations, not their duration, is related to the amount of information a consumer extracts from an ad. The information chunks extracted at each fixation are assumed to be random, varying across ads and consumers, and are estimated from the observed data. The accumulation of information across multiple fixations to the ad elements in long-term memory is assumed to be additive. The total amount of accumulated information that is not directly observed but estimated using our model influences both the accuracy and latency of subsequent brand memory. Accurate memory is assumed to occur when the accumulated information exceeds a threshold that varies randomly across ads and consumers in a binary probit-type of model component. The effect of two media-planning variables, the ad's serial position in a magazine and the ad's location on the double page, on the brand memory threshold are specified. We formulate hypotheses on the effects of ad element surface, serial position, and location.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.19.4.297.11794","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and consumer memory without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study defines diffusion speed as the time it takes to go from one penetration level to a higher level, and it measures speed using the slope coefficient of the logistic diffusion model. This metric relates unambiguously both to speed as just defined and to the empirical growth rate, a measure of instantaneous penetration growth. The data are analyzed using a single-stage hierarchical modeling approach for all products simultaneously in which parameters capturing the adoption ceilings are estimated jointly with diffusion speed parameters.

In particular, the assumptions that exits are irrevocable and necessarily public are dropped, making endogenous the decision to compete silently and privately, or openly. In the model, the price rises in a stylization of an auctioneer alternately recognizing two bidders who affirm willingness to pay the current price. The auctioneer pays attention to other bidders only when a recognized bidder exits. Such exits may be temporary, although we construct an equilibrium in which there is no benefit to exit and reentry. The number of public exits is stochastic; frequently a losing \u201cbidder\u201d will remain silent, giving no indication of his willingness to pay, and hence yielding no useful inference about his private information. Thus, the source of the expected revenue advantage of English auctions over second-price auctions is only stochastically available. Moreover, when public exits are incomplete, the ordinal rank of the bidder whose private information can be inferred is unknown, making that information less valuable. Consequently, the simpler formula for expected revenue in second-price auctions may be the preferred approximation for English auctions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.1.1.15128","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of English auctions without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The demand for the product is random, and it is independent and identically distributed from period to period. The demand is observed at the beginning of a time period, but it need not be filled until the end of the period. Unfilled demand is backordered. A base stock or order-up-to policy is used. The shortfall is the order-up-to level minus the inventory position. The inventory system is easily understood and managed if we know the distribution of the shortfall. We develop a new approximation for this distribution, and perform extensive computational tests of existing approximations. Our new approximation works extremely well as long as the coefficient of variation of the demand is less than two. For practical applications this is by far the most interesting case. No known approximations work well consistently when the coefficient of variation of the demand is greater than two.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.1.104.15129","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Both groups exhibited substantial distortion of information, with little reduction for professional decisions compared to nonprofessional ones. However, auditors' distortion was significantly smaller than that of salespersons. In addition, holding professionals accountable for their decisions, akin to a supervisory review, lowered distortion somewhat for salespersons but not at all for auditors. The latter seemed to act as if they were always being held accountable. Because people seem unaware that they are distorting information, at least at the moment this bias is occurring, they are fully convinced of the soundness of their choices.

A look ahead algorithm is then introduced that outperforms the dispatcher by about 12% with only a small increase in run time. These algorithms set the stage for the introduction of a genetic algorithm that uses job permutations as the population. The genetic approach presented here is novel in that it uses two additional binary variables, one to allow the dispatcher to occasionally skip a job in the queue and another to allow the dispatcher to occasionally allocate the worst position to the job. These variables are included in the recombination step in a natural way. The resulting schedules improve on the look ahead by as much as 15% at times and 3% on average.

Sources of Cost Reduction in a Large Specialty Chemicals Producer","Conventional learning curves relating unit cost to measures of production experience are estimated for 221 specialty chemicals produced by a Fortune 500 company. Detailed records on cost and R\u2026D coupled with insights from company personnel are used to explain the variation across products in the rate of cost reduction. Products that exhibited the strongest relationship between unit cost and measures of production experience were subject to specific initiatives, particularly process R\u2026D. The R\u2026D was not, however, generally motivated or informed, by production experience. However, cumulative past output, the most commonly used measure of production experience, was related to expected future output, which conditioned the expected future returns from R\u2026D and the choice of R\u2026D projects. Thus, cumulative output was connected to unit costs through its role in conditioning incentives to undertake process R\u2026D rather than as a proxy for production experience. This suggests that the strong relationship commonly found between unit cost and measures of production experience may reflect incentives to reduce cost as much as learning from production experience.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.1.28.15133","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cost reduction and production experience without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

Rather than follow the procedure of implying out the behavior of spreads from assumptions concerning the default process, we work directly with the evolution of spreads. The risk-neutral drifts in the resulting model possess a recursive representation that facilitates implementation and makes it possible to handle path-dependence and early exercise features without difficulty. The framework permits embedding a variety of specifications for default; we present an empirical example of a default structure which provides promising calibration results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.1.46.15124","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for pricing credit derivatives without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The optimal rationing policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone critical work storage levels. For each demand class, there exists a work storage level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher-priority demands.

We investigate two hypotheses regarding stimulus-based causes of preference uncertainty. As predicted by our attribute conflict hypothesis, greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an evaluative alternative) led to longer judgment times and greater response error. As predicted by our attribute extremity hypothesis, greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) resulted in shorter judgment times and less response error. We also found that judgment times and response errors were strongly positively correlated at the item level, consistent with our assumption that preference uncertainty generated by stimulus characteristics is manifested in judgment time and error. Finally, we found that the item-level preference uncertainty effects proposed here operate in parallel with strategy-level, effort-accuracy tradeoffs observable across participants.

This paper develops a computational model of the diffusion of a profitable innovation through a firm, and uses numerical simulations to calculate the relative importance of the direct and structural adjustment components of changes in profitability. One finding is that a failure to recognize the importance of organizational structure on the performance of firms will lead to serious bias in estimation of the costs or benefits of a change in external circumstances. The type of network model developed also has implications for the individuals and divisions that make up the firm.

A major finding is that an improvement in the technology of dialysis is likely to have a more substantial impact on the overall life expectancy of the dialysis population as compared to an increase in the dialysis reimbursement rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.10.1317.12271","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['mortality', 'reimbursement', 'delivery system']","The article discusses the healthcare delivery system and mortality rates, indicating a concern for patient outcomes, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

In this paper I study one dimension of this phenomenon: the role of impending layoffs in determining employee commitment to process improvement. Currently, the literature provides two opposing theories concerning the effect of job security on the ability of firms to implement change initiatives. The \u201cDrive Out Fear\u201d school argues that firms must commit to job security, while the \u201cDrive In Fear\u201d school emphasizes the positive role that insecurity plays in motivating change. In this study a contract theoretic model is developed to analyze the role of agency in process improvement. The main insight of the study is that there are two types of job security, internal and external, that have opposing impacts on the firm's ability to implement improvement initiatives. The distinction is useful in explaining the results of different case studies and can reconcile the two change theories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.11.1385.12084","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['job security', 'employee commitment', 'process improvement']","The article discusses job security and its impact on employee commitment to process improvement, which touches on themes of workplace ethics and employee welfare.

We focus on contracts of the form (w1, w2, b) where wi is the wholesale price offered for production mode i and b is a return price offered for items left over at the end of the season.

The centers provide parts replacement service to customers and replenish their inventory from the depot, following a one-for-one policy. The depot fills center replenishment orders on a first-come-first-serve basis. Defectives received at the centers are passed to the depot for repair and depot inventory replenishment. For this system, existing models (e.g., the METRIC model) usually assume that the depot replenishment lead times (DRLTs) are i.i.d., which however, does not fit well into the service parts logistics system that motivated this research. Because the DRLTs consist of the sum of repair times, defective return times, and transportation times, they are different across stocking centers, which are located globally. We study the impact of such center-dependent DRLTs on system performance. We derive probability distributions of the random delays at the depot experienced by center replenishment orders. We prove that a center with shorter DRLTs experiences shorter delays, and therefore, delivers better customer service. We show that for such systems, using the i.i.d. DRLT assumption introduces errors in estimating system performance. These errors become significant when both the demand rates and the depot planned inventory level are low.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.11.1441.12081","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of inventory systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study presents a method to elicit the probability weighting function in rank-dependent expected utility theory that makes no prior assumptions about the functional form of the probability weighting function. We use both aggregate and individual subject data, thereby allowing for heterogeneity of individual preferences, and we examine probability weighting in a new domain, medical decision making. There is significant evidence of probability weighting both at the aggregate and at the individual subject level. The modal probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped, displaying both lower subadditivity and upper subadditivity. Probability weighting is in particular relevant at the boundaries of the unit interval. Compared to studies involving monetary outcomes, we generally find more elevation of the probability weighting function. The robustness of the empirical findings on probability weighting indicates its importance. Ignoring probability weighting in modeling decision under risk and in utility measurement is likely to lead to descriptively invalid theories and distorted elicitations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.11.1485.12086","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['decision making', 'preferences', 'utility theory']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of decision theory and probability weighting without addressing social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Using data for Lake County, Illinois and Chicago, we demonstrate that nondominated allocations represent significant trade-offs between dollar-valued and non-dollar-valued policy objectives; existing distributions of subsidized housing represent suboptimal solutions to the housing relocation problem; and increases in available rental housing can result in housing dispersion schemes that have positive net economic benefits relative to the status quo.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.12.1569.12077","","MS","Multidisciplinary","6","['housing mobility', 'integrated neighborhoods', 'public housing', 'policy objectives']","The article discusses housing mobility programs aimed at providing access to economically healthy and integrated neighborhoods, indicating a focus on social equity and public welfare.

Its novelty stems from a learning phase where decision makers (DMs) explore the structural characteristics of the specific Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. This provides important and timely feedback to the DMs. Its core consists of four indices and their relationships. The solution framework consists of three stages. In the first, each DM provides the limits of variation for each problem parameter. These are subsequently combined into a unique interval of variation. Then, the stochastic multiobjective problem is transformed into a deterministic one. In the second stage, DMs use the four MCDM characteristics to familiarize themselves with the problem before expressing their preferences for nondominated solutions. The DMs are then guided through an interactive procedure to find their best nondominated solutions. In the last stage, all best nondominated solutions provided by the DMs are combined using a twofold approach to find the best-compromise nondominated solution. This final choice represents the opinion of the group of DMs. Our results show that the learning phase is beneficial to DMs in judging the quality of solutions, leading to better informed decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.12.1585.12071","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our examples also demonstrate that, among products that experience demand peaks during the firm's busy season, those that peak early in the busy season should be priced more aggressively than those that peak later.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.12.1602.12073","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and production scheduling without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

By replacing the linear demand curve in Bagwell and Riordan's (1991) price as a signal of quality model with a kinked demand curve, and analyzing what price endings firms are most likely to use, the following observations can be made: (1) Firms that are using high prices to signal quality are more likely to set those prices at round numbers, and (2) price-endings themselves are not necessarily signals of quality. A simulation was conducted to demonstrate that these findings generally hold true even in the presence of demand spikes at 9-ending prices (e.g., Schindler and Kibarian 1996). Finally, empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that firms tend to use more round prices for higherquality products, and that this relationship is even stronger for product categories where consumers are less able to detect the true level of quality prior to purchase.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.12.1617.12078","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a theoretical model regarding pricing strategies and quality signaling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This argument is tested with data describing projects conducted by all major competitors in the semiconductor industry. Each project was aimed at a technological transition, defined as the introduction of a major new generation of process technology. The analysis shows substantial differences among competitors in the approach taken (i.e., evolutionary vs. revolutionary) and results achieved. Additionally, it shows that individual organizations can migrate, over time, from evolution to revolution and vice versa. The analysis further indicates that accumulating experience and generating knowledge through experimentation are significantly associated with project performance. While product performance improvement through revolution is associated with research experience and with parallel experimentation capacity, improvement through evolution is associated with project experience and minimum experimental iteration time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.169.11922","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of managing technological transitions in the semiconductor industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The choice of an information system affects the level of managerial slack that is generated during project implementation. Whether slack is beneficial or costly to an organization has been the subject of debate. In our model of the hold-up problem in capital budgeting, there are both costs and benefits to having managerial slack. The cost of slack is the consumption of perquisites by the manager. The benefit of slack is that it can serve as a motivational tool. The possibility of increasing his slack may encourage a self-interested manager to conduct a more diligent search for a profitable project. To trade off the costs and benefits of slack in our model, an optimal information system sometimes incorporates coarse information, late information, and a mix of monitored and self-reported information. These features are familiar to accountants. Accounting incorporates both verified (monitored) and unverified (self-reported) information and provides information that is aggregated (coarse) and historical (late).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.205.11927","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['managerial slack', 'incentives', 'information system']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of capital budgeting and information system design, with minimal emphasis on social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The benefits of VMI are well recognized by successful retail businesses such as Wal-Mart. In VMI, distortion of demand information (known as bullwhip effect) transferred from the downstream supply-chain member (e.g., retailer) to the upstream member (e.g., supplier) is minimized, stockout situations are less frequent, and inventory-carrying costs are reduced. Furthermore, a VMI supplier has the liberty of controlling the downstream resupply decisions rather than filling orders as they are placed. Thus, the approach offers a framework for synchronizing inventory and transportation decisions. In this paper, we present an analytical model for coordinating inventory and transportation decisions in VMI systems. Although the coordination of inventory and transportation has been addressed in the literature, our particular problem has not been explored previously. Specifically, we consider a vendor realizing a sequence of random demands from a group of retailers located in a given geographical region. Ideally, these demands should be shipped immediately. However, the vendor has the autonomy of holding small orders until an agreeable dispatch time with the expectation that an economical consolidated dispatch quantity accumulates. As a result, the actual inventory requirements at the vendor are partly dictated by the parameters of the shipment-release policy in use. We compute the optimum replenishment quantity and dispatch frequency simultaneously. We develop a renewaltheoretic model for the case of Poisson demands, and present analytical results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.217.11923","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The challenge is to develop tactical planning forecasts at the SKU level. We use a traditional market-response model to extract information from continuous variables and use datamining techniques on the residuals to extract information from the many-valued nominal variables, such as the manufacturer or merchandise category. This combination means that a more complete array of information can be used to develop tactical planning forecasts. The method is illustrated using records of the aggregate sales during promotion events conducted by a 95-store retail chain in a single trading area. In a longitudinal cross validation, the statistical forecast (PromoCast\u2122) predicted the exact number of cases of merchandise needed in 49% of the promotion events and was within \u00b1 one case in 82% of the events. The dataminer developed rules from an independent sample of 1.6 million observations and applied these rules to almost 460,000 promotion events in the validation process. The dataminer had sufficient confidence to make recommendations on 46% of these forecasts. In 66% of those recommendations, the dataminer indicated that the forecast should not be changed. In 96% of those promotion events where \u201cno change\u201d was recommended, this was the correct \u201caction\u201d to take.

The key benefit sought from process change is a long term increase in effective capacity. However, realizing success from process change is not trivial. First, while process change may increase effective capacity in the long run, the disruptions during implementation typically reduce short term capacity. Second, competitive forces such as decreasing revenue streams and shrinking product life cycles complicate the implementation of process change. Third, while knowledge may enhance the ultimate benefits derived from process change, the correct timing and means of knowledge creation are difficult to discern. Lastly, a variety of trade-offs must be evaluated when selecting the particular process change to pursue. For example, choices range from hardware and software replacements to modification of manufacturing procedures. The model introduced here explicitly considers both the short term loss due to disruption and the long term gain in effective capacity associated with the process change. In addition, investments in the accumulation of knowledge are investigated for their potential to enhance process change effectiveness. Knowledge is generated from investment in preparation and training (learning-before-doing) and as a by-product of process change (learning-by-doing). Analysis of the model provides managerial recommendations for several key decisions relating to process change implementation including: (i) the selection of an appropriate process change alternative, (ii) the rate and timing for investment in process change, and (iii) the rate and timing for investment in preparation and training. New results are reported reflecting the important relationship between process change and knowledge. For example, we show that under certain conditions, a firm should optimally delay investment in process change until sufficient accumulation of knowledge is achieved. More generally, we identify conditions whereby investment in process change occurs at an increasing rate over time. This result is particularly important since it demonstrates a limitation of the existing literature where process change always occurs at a decreasing rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.2.265.11925","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing performance and process change without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We then formulate and solve drug treatment and prevention spending decisions in the framework of dynamic optimal control under different assumptions about how freely drug control budgets can be manipulated.

Prevention is most appropriate when there are relatively few heavy users, e.g. in the beginning of an epidemic. Treatment is more effective later.

When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage.

We also identify a sufficient condition under which the optimal price decreases over time for a given inventory level. This sufficient condition requires that the willingness of a customer to pay a premium for the product does not increase over time.

Numerical studies are conducted to show the revenue impact of dynamic price policies. Price changes are set to compensate for statistical fluctuations of demand and to respond to shifts of the reservation price. For the former, our examples show that using optimal dynamic optimal policies achieves 2.4\u20137.3% revenue improvement over the optimal single price policy. For the latter, the revenue increase can be as high as 100%.

Their primary application has been to medical treatment decisions. It is often convenient to present stochastic trees in factored form, allowing loosely coupled pieces of the model to be formulated and presented separately. In this paper, we show how the notion of factoring can be extended as well to preference components of the stochastic model. We examine updateable-state utility, a flexible class of expected utility models that permit stochastic trees to be rolled back much in the manner of decision trees. We show that preference summaries for updateable-state utility can be factored out of the stochastic tree. In addition, we examine utility decompositions which can arise when factors in a stochastic tree are treated as attributes in a multiattribute utility function.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.3.389.12067","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic trees and decision-making models without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If too much is ordered, stock is left over at the end of the period, whereas if too little is ordered, sales are lost. The expected profit-maximizing order quantity is well known, but little is known about how managers actually make these decisions. We describe two experiments that investigate newsvendor decisions across different profit conditions. Results from these studies demonstrate that choices systematically deviate from those that maximize expected profit. Subjects order too few of high-profit products and too many of low-profit products. These results are not consistent with risk-aversion, risk-seeking preferences, Prospect Theory preferences, waste aversion, stockout aversion, or the consequences of underestimating opportunity costs. Two explanations are consistent with the data. One, subjects behave as if their utility function incorporates a preference to reduce ex-post inventory error, the absolute difference between the chosen quantity and realized demand. Two, subjects suffer from the anchoring and insufficient adjustment bias. Feedback and training did not mitigate inventory order errors.

The line is unpaced in the sense that items only move to the next workstation when all workers on the line have completed their respective tasks. The design problem in this case is to assign both workers and tasks to workstations to minimize the expected sum of regular and overtime costs. To solve this problem, we develop an optimization algorithm for smaller problems and a heuristic algorithm for larger problems, which we use to investigate the sensitivity of total expected cost to changes in the price of overtime, hiring practices, worker differences, and the overall amount of work time variability. Based on an extensive computational analysis, we found that (1) planned overtime is frequently beneficial, (2) more workers should be hired as worker variability increases, and (3) increases in overtime costs frequently yield a relatively lower percentage increase in total expected cost.

To survive, IT firms must develop high quality software products on time and at low cost. A key issue is whether high levels of quality can be achieved without adversely impacting cycle time and effort. Conventional beliefs hold that processes to improve software quality can be implemented only at the expense of longer cycle times and greater development effort. However, an alternate view is that quality improvement, faster cycle time, and effort reduction can be simultaneously attained by reducing defects and rework. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between process maturity, quality, cycle time, and effort for the development of 30 software products by a major IT firm. We find that higher levels of process maturity as assessed by the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model\u2122 are associated with higher product quality, but also with increases in development effort. However, our findings indicate that the reductions in cycle time and effort due to improved quality outweigh the increases from achieving higher levels of process maturity. Thus, the net effect of process maturity is reduced cycle time and development effort.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.4.451.12056","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development, specifically on process maturity and its impact on quality and efficiency, with no mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations."],["2000","46","4","Hau L.

It is a form of rebate given by the manufacturer to the retailer for units unsold at the retailer when the price drops during the product life cycle. It is a controversial policy in the PC industry because it is not clear how such a policy benefits the supply chain and its participants. We show that price protection is an instrument for channel coordination. For products with long manufacturing lead times, so the retailer has a single buying opportunity, a properly chosen price protection credit coordinates the channel. For products with shorter manufacturing lead times, so the retailer has two buying opportunities, price protection alone cannot guarantee channel coordination when wholesale prices are exogenous. However, when the price protection credit is set endogenously together with the wholesale prices, channel coordination is restored. In the two-buying-opportunity setting with fixed wholesale prices, we show that price protection has two primary impacts: (1) shifting sales forward in time and (2) increasing total sales. Finally, we present a simple numerical example that suggests, given the current economics of the PC industry, that price protection under fixed wholesale prices may benefit the total chain and the retailer but hurt the manufacturer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.4.467.12058","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of price protection practices in the personal computer industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Instead of selling a bundle of content and access through proprietary networks, these firms are shifting their distribution channels to the Internet. In this new setting, the content and Internet service providers find themselves in a relationship that is simultaneously cooperative and competitive. We find that proprietary content providers prefer the Internet channels to direct channels only if the access market is sufficiently competitive. Furthermore, maintaining a direct channel in addition to the Internet channels changes the equilibrium enough that the proprietary content providers prefer having the Internet channels, regardless of the level of competition in the access market. Telecommunications technology developments uniformly increase content providers' profit. On the other hand, the technology impact on Internet service provider profits is nonmonotonic: Their profits may increase or decrease as a result of lower telecommunication costs. While initially the ISP profit increases as more customers are drawn to the Internet, it eventually decreases as the spatial competition becomes more intense. We also show that proprietary content providers should benefit from having some free content available at the Internet service providers' sites to induce more customers to join the Internet.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.4.483.12053","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of distribution channels and profit dynamics in the telecommunications industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The market potential for each category or generation is treated as a variable rather than a constant parameter, which is typical of recently growing IT sectors such as wireless telecommunications. The model is calibrated, its plausibility discussed, and its face and predictive validity assessed using data on wireless telecommunications services from two Asian markets.

To examine differences in compensating top executives, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations that is designed to accommodate interconnections between performance, the level of compensation, and the mix of compensation components. We document that the shares of both bonus and option pay increase with performance and that the pay level and the extent of incentive pay positively affect firm performance.

Additionally, we find that Internet retailers' price adjustments over time are up to 100 times smaller than conventional retailers' price adjustments\u2014presumably reflecting lower menu costs in Internet channels. We also find that levels of price dispersion depend importantly on the measures employed. When we compare the prices posted by different Internet retailers we find substantial dispersion. Internet retailer prices differ by an average of 33% for books and 25% for CDs. However, when we weight these prices by proxies for market share, we find dispersion is lower in Internet channels than in conventional channels, reflecting the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers.

This result is due to the presence of additional interest rate risk that bears on the profit-and-loss statement associated with the forward position. This sheds some additional light on the respective features of forward and futures contracts written on interest rate-sensitive securities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.5.658.12045","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of hedging in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

(2000) by developing a model addressing preference uncertainty in multiattribute evaluation. The model is motivated by two hypotheses regarding properties of multiattribute profiles that lead to greater preference uncertainty. Our attribute conflict hypothesis predicts that greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an alternative) leads to more preference uncertainty. Our attribute extremity hypothesis predicts that greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) leads to less preference uncertainty. To provide a deeper explanation of attribute conflict and extremity effects, we develop RandMAU, a family of additive (RandAUF) and multiplicative (RandMUF) random weights multiattribute utility models. In RandMAU models, preference uncertainty is represented as random variation in both the weighting parameters governing trade-offs among attributes and the curvature parameters governing single-attribute evaluations. Simulation results show that RandMUF successfully predicts both the attribute conflict and attribute extremity effects exhibited by the experimental participants in Fischer et al. (2000). It also predicts an outcome value effect on error whose form depends on the shape of single-attribute functions and on the type of multiattribute combination rule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.5.669.12051","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of preference uncertainty and multiattribute evaluation without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The purpose of this paper is to direct the focus to a branch-and-bound concept that can, by simple adaptations, operate on a wide range of problem settings. The general approach can, e.g., deal with multimode problems, resource availability varying with time, and a wide range of objectives. Even the simple assembly line balancing problem of type-1 can be competitively approached with some modifications. Although the algorithm is the most general and simple one currently available for resource-constrained project scheduling, the computational performance can compete with the best approaches available for the single-mode problem. The algorithm uses far less memory than the state-of-the-art procedure, i.e., 256 KB versus 24 MB, for solving the standard benchmark set with projects consisting of 32 activities within comparable time. If both approaches are allowed to make limited use of memory, i.e., 256 KB, then more than 97% of the benchmark instances can be solved within fractions of the time required by the current state-of-the-art procedure. The truncated version of our algorithm achieves at 256 KB approximately the results of the truncated version of the state-of-the-art approach at 24 MB. Since in general the memory requirements exponentially grow with the number of activities the project consists of, memory will become a critical resource, and the strategy to access previously stored information will gain fundamental importance when solving larger projects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.5.710.12044","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of project scheduling and algorithm performance without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We consider a setting where a risk neutral supplier sells an intermediate product to a risk neutral buyer. The supplier incurs prevention costs to reduce the probability of selling a defective product, and the buyer incurs appraisal costs to identify defects. Both decisions are subject to moral hazard. We show that the first-best outcome can be obtained if either: (i) the supplier's prevention decision is contractible; or (ii) the buyer's appraisal decision and either internal failure (i.e., the product's failing the buyer's appraisal test) or external failure (i.e., the product's failing after being sold by the buyer) are contractible events; or (iii) both internal and external failure are contractible events. We then focus on the second-best setting where actions and failures are not contractible and study the effect of making the buyer's appraisal result contractible. Relative to first-best, if a buyer's return decision is contractible (but not his appraisal result), the supplier incurs lower prevention costs, the buyer incurs higher appraisal costs, expected internal failure costs are higher, and the total cost of quality is higher. The expected costs of external failure, however, may actually be lower relative to first-best. We then show that installing an information system that makes the appraisal result contractible reduces the inefficiency associated with the seller's prevention activity, increases the inefficiency associated with the buyer's quality appraisal activity, and unambiguously improves product quality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.6.776.11939","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product quality and cost without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that the orientation of the discriminant function relative to the row space and the nullspace (two fundamental subspaces) of the double-entry matrix determines the information loss due to aggregation. In addition, we observe that an interdependency in account balances is introduced by the double-entry process. The cause and effect property (debit and credit) translates into a negative covariance being introduced among account balances; this, in turn, affects the decision maker's optimal use of information. Finally, in discussing benefits to aggregation, we present an example in which adopting a double-entry aggregation rule serves as a commitment device for the owner.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.6.790.11935","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and decision-making without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Based on input and output data, an empirical efficiency status\u2014efficient or inefficient\u2014is assigned to each of the processes. This status may change if the data of the observed processes change. As illustrated by a capacity planning problem for hospitals in Germany, the need arises to gauge the robustness of empirical efficiency valuations. The example suggests to gauge the robustness of the efficiency valuation for a process with respect to perturbations of prespecified elements of the data. A natural measure of robustness is the minimal perturbation, in terms of a suitable distance function, of the chosen data elements that is necessary to change the efficiency status of the process under investigation. Farrell's (1957) efficiency score is an example of such a robustness measure. We give further examples of relevant data perturbations for which the robustness measure can be computed efficiently. We then focus on weighted maximum norm distance functions, such as the maximal absolute or percentage deviation, but allow for independent perturbations of the elements of an arbitrary a priori fixed subset of the data. In this setting, the robustness measure is naturally related to a certain threshold value for a linear monotone one-parameter family of perturbations and can be calculated by means of a linear programming\u2013based bisection method. Closed form solutions in terms of Farrell's efficiency score are obtained for specific perturbations. Following the theoretical developments, we revisit the hospital capacity planning problem to illustrate the managerial relevance of our techniques.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.6.807.11937","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical efficiency valuations and technical aspects of production processes without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper explores this proposition rigorously. A simple model is developed that parametrizes the two aspects of strategic complexity: the number of elements in a strategy and the interactions among those elements. The model excludes conventional resource-based and game-theoretic barriers to imitation altogether. The model is used to show that complexity makes the search for an optimal strategy intractable in the technical sense of the word provided by the theory of NP-completeness. Consequently, would-be copycats must rely on search heuristics or on learning, not on algorithmic \u201csolutions,\u201d to match the performance of superior firms. However, complexity also undermines heuristics and learning. In the face of complexity, firms that follow simple hill-climbing heuristics are quickly snared on low \u201clocal peaks,\u201d and firms that try to learn and mimic a high performer's entire strategy suffer large penalties from small errors. The model helps to explain why some winning strategies remain unmatched even though they are open to public scrutiny; why certain bundles of organizational practices diffuse slowly even though they lead to superior performance; and why some strategies yield superior returns even after many of their critical ingredients are adopted by competitors. The analysis also suggests roles for management science and managerial choice in a world of complex strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.6.824.11940","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of business strategy and complexity without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Two distinct but related aspects of this problem were treated: determining which units should be inspected, and determining how many units should be sent for inspection at the same time. The solution is based on the principles of inspecting the product units that maximize the reduction in the uncertainty regarding the location of the first nonconforming unit, and of minimizing the cost per unit of uncertainty reduced. These principles are formalized by means of a series of theorems leading to an easy-to-implement algorithm for managing parallel inspection.

Demand distributions are chosen from an opportunity set, which reflects the set of market opportunities for the firm. We analyze the firm's profit as a function of these demand alternatives, provide solution methods and insights, and identify inefficient and dominated distributions.

It shows that if the first mover knows the second mover to have a lower production cost, it positions away from the most attractive location in the market; further, the larger the second-mover's cost advantage, the farther away the first mover positions from the most attractive location. The paper also models uncertainty in the first-mover's mind about the later-entrant's cost structure, and shows that an increase in this uncertainty (in the sense of mean-preserving spread) also makes the first mover position farther from the most attractive location in the market. Overall, this paper suggests that unless the first entrant in a market is certain that the later entrant will not have a superior cost structure, it may be better off leaving the best position in the market vacant and having a niche or fringe product.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.7.928.12038","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product positioning and cost structures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal items with long procurement lead times. Given a sunk investment in seats, rooms, or winter coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize expected revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing of price changes within a given menu of allowable, possibly time dependent, price paths each of which is associated with a general Poisson process with Markovian, time dependent, predictable intensities. We show that a set of variational inequalities characterize the value functions and the optimal (possibly random) time changes. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal value functions and the optimal pricing policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.7.941.12035","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The analysis is based on a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic among a population of adults, ages 18 to 44. The population is divided into nine compartments according to infection status and risk group. The model takes into account disease transmission from drug injection and sexual contacts. The health benefits of methadone maintenance and the resulting HIV infections averted are measured in terms of life years gained and quality-adjusted life years gained. Costs considered include all health-care costs (including cost of HIV care and other health care) and the cost of methadone maintenance. The analysis shows that expanding existing methadone maintenance programs is a cost-effective health-care intervention that can play an important role in slowing the spread of HIV and improving the length and quality of life for injection drug users (IDUs), and that such expansion is cost-effective even in populations with low HIV prevalence among IDUs. Incremental expansion of methadone maintenance programs was found to have a cost-effectiveness ratio of between $9,700 and $17,200 per life year gained, and between $6,300 and $10,900 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Although methadone maintenance treatment is provided to IDUs, the analysis shows that significant benefits accrue to non-IDU members of the population. Sensitivity analysis shows that new methadone maintenance treatment slots will be cost-effective even if they are twice as expensive and half as effective in reducing risky behavior as current methadone maintenance programs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1013.12025","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['HIV prevention', 'cost-effectiveness', 'health benefits', 'injection drug users', 'quality of life']","The article discusses the health benefits of methadone maintenance treatment for injection drug users and its role in preventing HIV, indicating a focus on social health outcomes and ethical considerations in healthcare.

We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1032.12029","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain management and the efficiency of information sharing, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To solve them successfully requires the coordinated actions of many functional representatives acting in a decentralized setting. Functional managers, however, respond to their own individual incentives and may consequently fail to maximize the overall profits of the firm. We examine this issue in a setting in which the output of early actions limits the range of later actions, and we propose an incentive scheme that allows the system to be successfully decentralized. Our mechanism is based on linear transfer prices for the intermediate output that are implemented through an internal market; a market maker buys the output from one function and sells it to another. She is not obliged to sell at the same price at which she bought and may set prices solely to provide incentives. We illustrate the flexibility of the scheme by applying it to several models in the operations management literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1049.12022","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['coordination', 'incentives', 'decentralized']","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and profit maximization in a decentralized setting, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Thus, developing countries that use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, firms.

Although data are sometimes available to estimate such measures, in many applications they must be obtained by means of subjective judgment by experts. We discuss two experimental studies that compare the accuracy of six different methods for assessing dependence. Our results lead to several conclusions: First, simply asking experts to report a correlation is a reasonable approach. Direct estimation is more accurate than the other methods studied, is not prone to mathematically inconsistent responses (as are some other measures), and is judged to be less difficult than alternate methods. In addition, directly assessed correlations showed less variability than the correlations derived from other assessment methods. Our results also show that experience with the variables can improve performance somewhat, as can training in a given assessment method. Finally, if a judge uses several different assessment methods, an average of the resulting estimates can also lead to better performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1100.12023","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for assessing dependence in decision-making without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Low discrepancy simulation methods offer the potential to provide faster rates of convergence than those of standard Monte Carlo methods; however, in high dimensional problems special methods are required to ensure that the faster convergence rates hold. Indeed, Ninomiya and Tezuka (1996) have shown highdimensional examples, in which low discrepancy methods perform worse than Monte Carlo methods. The principal component construction introduced by Acworth et al. (1998) provides one solution to this problem. However, the computational effort required to generate each path grows quadratically with the dimension of the problem. This article presents two new methods that offer accuracy equivalent, in terms of explained variability, to the principal components construction with computational requirements that are linearly related to the problem dimension. One method is to take into account knowledge about the payoff function, which makes it more flexible than the Brownian Bridge construction. Numerical results are presented that show the benefits of such adjustments. The different methods are compared for the case of pricing mortgage backed securities using the Hull-White term structure model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.9.1171.12239","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Monte Carlo simulation in finance without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Specifically, we consider an objective that relates the probability of achieving a given performance objective to the time it takes to achieve the objective. This allows a new direct quantitative analysis of the risk/return tradeoff, with risk defined directly in terms of probability of shortfall relative to the benchmark, and return defined in terms of the expected time to reach investment goals relative to the benchmark. The resulting optimal policy is a state-dependent policy that provides new insights.

The underlying stochastic model captures the initial suppression and eventual rebound of the virus level in the blood of a typical HIV-infected patient undergoing treatment. We consider two classes of policies: a viral load policy, which triggers a change in therapy when the current virus level divided by the smallest level achieved thus far exceeds a prespecified threshold, and a proactive policy, which is similar to the viral load policy but also switches drugs at a prespecified time if no evidence of viral rebound has been seen. We find approximate analytical expressions for the probability of switching before the virus reaches its nadir (minimum value) and the mean delay in detection of viral rebound (i.e., the time interval from when the viral nadir occurs until the switch in therapy). Numerical results show that the proactive policy outperforms (i.e., a smaller detection delay for a given probability of prenadir switching) the viral load policy and recent recommendations by an expert AIDS panel, and may delay the onset of multidrug resistance in a significant proportion of patients who experience drug failure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.9.1200.12235","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managing HIV therapy without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It also contains some new results and ideas. The aim is to examine the basic principles supporting these methods and how they can be used effectively for the simulation models that are typically encountered in the area of management science. These models can usually be reformulated as integration problems over the unit hypercube with a large (sometimes infinite) number of dimensions. We examine selection criteria for the lattice rules and suggest criteria which take into account the quality of the projections of the lattices over selected low-dimensional subspaces. The criteria are strongly related to those used for selecting linear congruential and multiple recursive random number generators. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.9.1214.12231","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of lattice methods for integration and variance reduction without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Results are  threefold: First, delay cost curves are introduced that allow for a flexible description of a customer's  quality sensitivity. Second, a comprehensive executable approach is proposed that analytically specifies scheduling,  delay distributions and prices for arbitrary delay sensitivity curves. The tractability of this approach derives from porting  heavy-traffic Brownian results into the economic analysis. The generalized c\u03bc (Gc\u03bc) scheduling  rule that emerges is dynamic so that, in general, service grades need not correspond to a static priority ranking. A benchmarking example  investigates the value of differentiated service. Third, the notions of grade and rate incentive  compatibility (IC) are introduced to study this system under asymmetric information and are established for Gc\u03bc  scheduling when service times are homogeneous and customers atomistic. Grade IC induces correct grade choice resulting  in perfect service discrimination; rate IC additionally induces centralized-optimal rates. Dynamic Gc\u03bc  scheduling exhibits negative feedback that, together with time-dependent pricing, can also yield rate incentive compatibility  with heterogeneous service times. Finally, multiplan pricing, which offers all customers a menu  with a choice of multiple rate plans, is analyzed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.46.9.1249.12238","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queuing systems and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We take the viewpoint of a manufacturer selling a short life-cycle product to a single risk-neutral retailer and describe returns policies that, when compared to no returns, satisfy two conditions: (1) the retailer's expected profit is increased and (2) the manufacturer's profit is at least as large as when no returns are allowed.

These limits directly affect the risk inherent in those decisions. While risk consideration is well developed in finance through efficient market theory and the capital asset pricing model, operations management models do not generally adopt these principles. One reason for this apparent inconsistency may be that analysis of an operational model does not reveal the level of risk until the model is solved. Using results from option pricing theory, we show that this inconsistency can be avoided in a wide range of planning models. By assuming the availability of market hedges, we show that risk can be incorporated into planning models by adjusting capacity and resource levels. The result resolves some possible inconsistencies between finance and operations and provides a financial basis for many planning problems.

When examined in isolation, the service system model confirms a well-known \u201crule of thumb\u201d from the queueing literature: Flexible or cross-trained servers provide more throughput with fewer workers than specialized servers.

However, in complex supply chains, it is not always obvious where to hold safety stock to minimize inventory costs and provide a high level of service to the final customer. In this paper we develop a framework for modeling strategic safety stock in a supply chain that is subject to demand or forecast uncertainty. Key assumptions are that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic-review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of strategic safety stock for supply chains that can be modeled as spanning trees. Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories. We conclude with a list of needs to enhance the utility of the model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.1.68.23267","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory optimization without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Each job is an instance of demand for an item and is associated with a family, a holding cost rate, and a mean processing time. Set-up times are required to switch from one family to another, but are not required to switch within a family. We consider the case in which the order of jobs within the family is unconstrained, and a variation in which the order is fixed. The optimization is with respect to the weighted flowtime, and we treat problems both with and without a makespan-constraint. Practical examples based on this model are described. We partially characterize an optimal policy by means of a Gittins rewardrate index and a similar switching index derived from multi-armed bandit theory. For deterministic problems with a makespan constraint, we present an optimization algorithm for the special case of two families and at most three set-ups . Without a makespan constraint and without preemption, we prove that our analysis of a deterministic model extends to stochastic set-up and processing times without loss of optimality.

There is a fixed total market of customers whose demands for the good or service are random and who divide their patronage between the firms in each period. Periodically, the market shares of the two firms can change based on the realized level of customer service provided in the prior period. We assume that the expected level of customer service can be expressed as a function of the (per customer) capacity of the firms' service delivery systems, and that service declines as the capacity decreases. The firms differ in their customers' willingness to defect when confronted by service failure. The primary issue we address is the firms' capacity decisions in response to customer service concerns and competitive pressure. We provide conditions under which the firms' optimal (i.e., equilibrium) capacity levels in a period are proportional to the size of their respective customer bases in that period. Further, we develop expressions for the value of a firm's customers and the implicit cost of service failure. Results for both single-period and finite-horizon problems are investigated and applied to two examples: (1) competition between Internet service providers who operate systems that we approximate by simple loss-type queueing models, and (2) competition between make-to-stock producers who operate systems that we approximate by newsvendor inventory models.

This paper addresses a dynamic requirements-planning problem for two-stage multi product manufacturing systems with bill-of-materials flexibility, i.e., with options to use substitute components or subassemblies produced by an upstream stage to meet demand in each period at the downstream stage. We model the problem as an integer program, and describe a dynamic-programming solution method to find the production and substitution quantities that satisfy given multi period downstream demands at minimum total setup, production, conversion, and holding cost. This methodology can serve as a module in requirements-planning systems to plan opportunistic component substitutions based on relative future demands and production costs. Computational results using real data from an aluminum-tube manufacturer show that substitution can save, on average, 8.7% of manufacturing cost. We also apply the model to random problems with a simple product structure to develop insights regarding substitution behavior and impacts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.2.166.12349","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production planning and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The proposal assumes that a management information system, presumably electronic, is established to monitor inventories and shipment quantities, and to carry out transfer payments between players. As in Lee and Whang(1999), the incentives of the system are aligned, so if each player is brilliantly self-serving, the system optimal solution will result. While the system administrator need not know how the system should be managed, the most upstream player must know how to manage the system optimally for the system optimal solution to be achieved. RTs endow the system with an attractive self-correcting property: An example illustrates that upstream players are given a mechanism and the incentive to correct for downstream overordering. The downstream players who over-order are penalized, but system performance is not degraded much.

In a congested facility, such a situation would be impossible using conventional queuing logic. We propose a conceptual model of a firm in which workers make schedule by rushing jobs, if necessary, with potential quality consequences. Hence, time and quality are substitutes, a feature that we recognize explicitly in our definition of the firm's capacity. Production yields are not exogenous parameters but endogenously determined by workers responding to schedule pressures. The plant manager can authorize overtime to relieve this pressure or live with the quality consequences of rushing. The model reveals the close relationships among the firm's workforce policies, the integrity of the inspection system, and the cost performance of the firmas its volume and/or product line expands. We consider pure congestion (driven by volume) and pure complexity (driven by product line breadth) effects in the context of our plant performance model. We consider two root causes of complexity costs: time and quality. The time effects of complexity will only have cost consequences in congested facilities, but quality effects are always present. Also in contrast to time effects, quality effects of complexity can be present in nonbottleneck workstations. Hence, the quality consequences of complexity can be as, or more important than the time consequences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.3.221.12348","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['workers', 'quality', 'capacity']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and production processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, existing principal-agent models are of limited use to OM researchers because they cannot represent the rich dynamic structure required of OM models. This paper formulates a novel dynamic model that overcomes these limitations by combining the principal-agent framework with the physical structure of a Markov decision process. In this model one has a system moving from state to state as time passes, with transition probabilities depending on actions chosen by an agent, and a principal who pays the agent based on state transitions observed. The principal seeks an optimal payment scheme, striving to induce the actions that will maximize her expected discounted profits over a finite planning horizon. Although dynamic principal-agent models similar to the one proposed here are considered intractable, a set of assumptions are introduced that enable a systematic analysis. These assumptions involve the \u201ceconomic structure\u201d of the model but not its \u201cphysical structure.\u201d Under these assumptions, the paper establishes that one can use a dynamic-programming recursion to derive an optimal payment scheme. This scheme is memoryless and satisfies a generalization of Bellman's principle of optimality.

However, achieving such high quality while controlling for costs is a major challenge for service managers. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach for addressing this challenge. The approach entails developing a model linking service process operational variables to service quality metrics to provide guidelines for service resource allocation.

Because of rapid changes in technology and ongoing engineering changes, all parts subject to obsolescence are purchased only for the current customer order. The procurement lead times of the components are random. Moreover, although the order for the finished product has a defined due date, the contract allows the customer to change the order quantity. Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity. We present some structural results and discuss insights regarding optimal policies. We also present several simple heuristic policies and compare them to optimal policies. Computational results indicate that ignoring lead time variability can be costly, but relatively simple heuristics that consider lead time variability perform quite well.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.3.287.12346","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost minimization without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity and inclusion."],["2000","2","3","Anantaram BalakrishnanAnantaram Balakrishnananantb@psu.eduSmeal College of Business Administration The Pennsylvania State University University Park, Pennsylvania 16802Search for more papers by this author, Harihara Prasad NatarajanHarihara Prasad NatarajanSmeal College of Business Administration The Pennsylvania State University University Park, Pennsylvania 16802Search for more papers by this author, Michael S.

This figure is expected to grow by 15 to 20% annually as manufacturing firms increasingly partner with third-party logistics providers to cost effectively distribute their products, while meeting increasingly stringent service expectations of customers. These logistics partnerships have introduced a new set of decision requirements to negotiate compensation for distribution services. Based on a collaborative project with a leading building products manufacturer, this paper describes the development and implementation of a novel linear programming model to decide the delivery fees paid to distributors. The model applies to manufacturer-distributor partnerships where distributors are compensated using fee values that depend on delivery weights and distances. It ensures that the expected compensation, considering stochastic demands, is adequate to cover the aggregate distribution costs for each distributor, and permits imposing various consistency conditions to ensure that fee values are credible. The model proved effective in helping the manufacturer develop a new fee table that generated considerable economic savings and provided more equitable compensation to distributors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.3.297.12347","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['equitable', 'compensation', 'distributors']","The article discusses equitable compensation for distributors, indicating a moderate focus on fairness in business practices.

If our assumptions hold, our model offers you a single numerical measure, called the degree of product/process innovation, to determine your initiative's impact on potential sales, prices, market segments, and profits. Our simple, single-period model is a variation of the existing vertically differentiated products model: There are two competing substitute products, and customers will buy at most one of them. Our contribution is to allow new relationships between the valuations of the two products by potential customers, and to allow differing unit production costs. We identify equilibrium results when two competing firms each offer one product, and find the profit maximizing result when one (monopolistic) firm offers both products. The new product infringes on the market in one of two ways: High-end encroachment results when the new product attracts the best customers (those with the highest reservation prices), while low-end encroachment identifies a situation where the new product attracts fringe (lower-end) customers. Low-end encroachment may help explain why an incumbent sometimes fails to recognize the threat of an entrant's product, as we illustrate with an example from the disk drive industry. In short, we offer insight into the value of both a marketing objective (enhancing the product design attributes) and a manufacturing goal (lowering the production cost) in a product and/or process improvement project.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.4.317.12337","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing and manufacturing innovation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A firm's new product success depends on its ability to manage the product development process in a way that employs scarce resources to achieve the goal of the firm as well as the specific project's objectives. Simple and measurable performance metrics have been proposed and applied to monitor and compensate the development teams. In this paper, we develop a modeling frame work to analyze the implications of setting managerial priorities for three commonly used new product performance metrics: (1) time-to-market, (2) product performance, and (3) total development cost. We model new product development as a \u201cproduct performance production\u201d process that requires scarce development resources. Setting a target for development teams for each of these performance metrics can constrain this performance production process and, thereby, affect the other performance metrics. We model the constrained process as a restricted case of a general process that does not have such constraints. We benchmark each constrained process against the optimal, unrestricted process with respect to the level of the resource intensity employed during the development process, the time-to-market, and the performance level of the new product at launch. We show that an overly ambitious time-to-market target leads to an upward bias in resource intensity usage and a downward bias in product performance (i.e., evolutionary product innovation). In addition, our results suggest that the target time-to-market approach may ignore the effect of cannibalization and, thus, can perform suboptimally if a significant degree of cannibalization in the existing product market is expected. Given a target product performance, we show that the coordination between marketing and R&D is easier because the resulting development resource intensity and time-to-market decisions becomes separable. However, an overly ambitious product performance target leads to an upward bias in the development resource intensity and a delayed product launch that misses the window of opportunity. Finally, we show that the target development cost approach can lead a downward bias in product performance and a premature product launch. The above analyses are performed for a monopolistic firm, and they are extended to passive and active competitive environment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.4.337.12341","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of new product development metrics and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this research we develop a stylized model to analyze the impact of using time guarantees on competition. Demands are assumed to be sensitive to both the price and delivery time guarantees, and the objective of each firm is to select the best price and time guarantee to maximize its operating profit. We first analyze the optimization problem for the individual firms and then study the equilibrium solution in a multiple-firm competition. Using a numerical study, we further illustrate how the different firm and market characteristics would affect the price and delivery time competition in the market. Our results suggest that the equilibrium price and time guarantee decisions in an oligopolistic market with identical firms behave in a similar fashion as the optimal solution in a monopolistic situation from a previous study. However, when there are heterogeneous firms in the market, these firms will exploit their distinctive firm characteristics to differentiate their services. Assuming all other factors being equal, the high capacity firms provide better time guarantees, while firms with lower operating costs offer lower prices, and the differentiation becomes more acute as demands become more time-sensitive. Furthermore, as time-attractiveness of the market increases, firms compete less on price, and the equilibrium prices of the firms increase as a result. Our findings provide important implications about firm behaviour under price and time competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2.4.392.12336","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service delivery competition, emphasizing price and time guarantees without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This problem is similar to the classic newsvendor problem, except: (a) the distribution of demand is a function of the selling price, which is determined by the retailer; and (b) the objective of the retailer is to maximize his/her expected utility. We consider two different ways in which price affects the distribution of demand. In the first model, we assume that a change in price affects the scale of the distribution. In the second model, a change in price only affects the location of the distribution. We present methodology by which this problem with two decision variables can be simplified by reducing it to a problem in a single variable. We show that in comparison to a risk-neutral retailer, a risk-averse retailer in the first model will charge a higher price and order less; where as, in the second model a risk-averse retailer will charge a lower price. The implications of these findings for supply-chain strategy and channel design are discussed.

Component commonality can help companies reduce the cost of providing product variety to their customers. However, determining the extent to which component commonality should be used is difficult. In this paper we present an approach to determine the optimal level of component commonality for end-product components that do not differentiate models from the customer's perspective. The work was inspired by and applied to a wire-harness design problem faced by a major automobile manufacturer. We model the component design problem as a mathematical program that considers production, inventory holding, setup, and complexity costs (the cost in indirect functions caused by component variety). We develop two approaches to solve the problem: a branch-and-bound algorithm that can solve small- and medium-size problems optimally, and a simulated annealing algorithm that can solve large-size problems heuristically. We apply both algorithms to the wireharness design problem faced by the automobile manufacturer and to a number of randomly generated test problems. We show that an optimal design achieves high cost savings by using significantly fewer variants than a no-commonality design but significantly more variants than a full-commonality design. We apply sensitivity analysis to identify extreme conditions under which the no-commonality and full-commonality designs perform well, and we identify the key cost drivers for our application. Finally, we describe the impact of our analysis on the company's subsequent component design decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.1.1.12445","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of component design and cost savings without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The reformulation gives rise to an integer master problem, whose typically large number of variables is dealt with implicitly by using an integer programming column generation procedure, also known as branch-and-price algorithm. There is a large class of integer programs that are well suited for this solution technique. In this paper, we propose to base the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of an integer program on the discretization of the integer polyhedron associated with a subsystem of constraints (as opposed to its convexification). This allows us to formulate the integrality restriction directly on the master variables and sets a theoretical framework for dealing with specific issues such as branching or the introduction of cutting planes in the master. We discuss specific branching schemes and their effect on the structure of the column generation subproblem. We give theoretical bounds on the complexity of the separation process and the extent of the modifications to the column generation subproblem. Our computational tests on the cutting stock problem and a generalisation\u2014the cutting strip problem\u2014show that, in practice, all fractional solutions can be eliminated using branching rules that preserve the tractability of the subproblem, but there is a trade-off between branching efficiency and subproblem tractability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.1.111.12453","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of integer programming and algorithmic techniques without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Unsatisfied demand is backordered, and each class has its own general service time distribution, renewal demand process, and holding and backordering cost rates. In the first problem, a setup cost is incurred when the server switches class, and the setup cost is replaced by a setup time in the second problem. In both problems we employ a long-run average cost criterion and restrict ourselves to a class of dynamic cyclic policies, where idle periods and lot sizes are state-dependent, but the N classes must be served in a fixed sequence. Motivated by existing heavy traffic limit theorems, we make a time scale decomposition assumption that allows us to approximate these scheduling problems by diffusion control problems. Our analysis of the approximating setup cost problem yields a closed-form dynamic lot-sizing policy and a computational procedure for an idling threshold. We derive structural results and an algorithmic procedure for the setup time problem.

Customer type, k, has an integer weight wk, a value bk, and an arrival rate \u03bbk (t) (which depends on time). We consider arrivals over a continuous time horizon [0; T] to a \u201cknapsack\u201d with capacity W. For each arrival that fits in the remaining knapsack capacity, we may (1) accept it, receiving bk, while giving up capacity wk; or (2) reject it, forgoing the value and not losing capacity.

We characterize the optimal return function and the optimal acceptance strategy for this problem, and we give solution methods. We generalize to multidimensional knapsack problems.

Accounting for demand substitution in defining customer service influences the choice of items to stock and the optimal inventory level for each item stocked. Further, when certain items are not stocked, the resulting substitutions increase the demand for other items, which also affects the optimal stock levels. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic demand model for items in an assortment that captures the effects of substitution and a methodology for selecting item inventory levels so as to maximize total expected profit, subject to given resource constraints. Illustrative examples are solved to provide insights concerning the behavior of the optimal inventory policies, using the negative binomial demand distribution, which has performed well in fitting retail sales data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.1.50.12443","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The decomposition of the efficient set into efficient faces is used as the basis of a search-based algorithm to solve this problem. The faces of the feasible region are characterized by the set of constraints that hold as equality in that face. The search is conducted over the indices of the constraints in a way that explores faces of possibly higher dimension first. Computational tests are performed to establish the behavior of the algorithm when the objective function is built according to different schemes that have received attention in the literature. The results indicate that different objective function types may lead to varying computation time requirements. In general, computational requirements of the algorithm increase significantly with problem size. A heuristic modification of the algorithm is proposed to solve large problems within reasonable time limits. Tests to measure the quality of the heuristic solutions show that the heuristic approach constitutes a practical alternative for finding good solutions for the problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.1.65.12449","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in linear programming without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Once a regenerative cycle is identified, the objective function is formed as the ratio of the expected cycle cost to the expected cycle time and optimized using the standard techniques. Application of the RRT requires only the first moments of the cycle-related random variables. However, if the start of a cycle corresponds to an important event, e.g., end of a period of shortages in an inventory problem, knowing only the expected time\u2014and the cost\u2014of the cycle may not give enough information on the functioning of the stochastic system. For example, it may be useful to know the probability that the cycle cost, or more importantly, the average cost per unit time will exceed predetermined levels. In this paper we provide a complete description of the cycle-related random variables for a stochastic inventory problem with supply interruptions. We assume a general phase-type distribution for the supplier's availability (ON) periods and an exponential distribution for the OFF periods. The first passage time of an embedded Markov chain of the ON/OFF process is used to develop the expressions for the exact distribution and the moments of the cycle time and cycle cost random variables. We then describe a method for computing the probability that the average cost per unit time will exceed a predetermined level. This method is used to construct an \u201cefficient frontier\u201d for the two criteria of (i) average cost and (ii) the probability of exceeding it. The efficient frontier is used to find a solution to the multiple-criteria optimization problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.2.243.12377","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on stochastic optimization and inventory problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2000","48","2","Silvano MartelloSilvano Martellosmartello@deis.unibo.itDEIS, University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, Bologna, ItalySearch for more papers by this author, David PisingerDavid PisingerDIKU, University of Copenhagen, University Parken 1, Copenhagen, DenmarkSearch for more papers by this author, Daniele VigoDaniele VigoDEIS, University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, Bologna, ItalySearch for more papers by this author","The Three-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem","The problem addressed in this paper is that of orthogonally packing a given set of rectangular-shaped items into the minimum number of three-dimensional rectangular bins.

As a result, the load on the generating units of a utility is becoming increasingly unpredictable. Furthermore, electric utilities may need to buy power or sell their production to a power pool that serves as a spot market for electricity. These trading activities expose utilities to volatile electricity prices. In this paper, we present a stochastic model for the unit commitment that incorporates power trading into the picture. Our model also accounts for fuel constraints and prices that may vary with electricity prices and demand. The resulting model is a mixed-integer program that is solved using Lagrangian relaxation and Bender's decomposition. Using this solution approach, we solve problems with 729 demand scenarios on a single processor to within 0.1% of the optimal solution in less than 10 minutes.

The origin-destination integer multicommodity flow problem is a constrained version of the linear multicommodity flow problem in which flow of a commodity (defined in this case by an origin-destination pair) may use only one path from origin to destination. Branch-and-price-and-cut is a variant of branch-and-bound, with bounds provided by solving linear programs using column-and-cut generation at nodes of the branch-and-bound tree. Because our model contains one variable for each origin-destination path, for every commodity, the linear programming relaxations at nodes of the branch-and-bound tree are solved using column generation, i.e., implicit pricing of nonbasic variables to generate new columns or to prove LP optimality. We devise a new branching rule that allows columns to be generated efficiently at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Then, we describe cuts (cover inequalities) that can be generated at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. These cuts help to strengthen the linear programming relaxation and to mitigate the effects of problem symmetry. We detail the implementation of our combined column-and-cut generation method and present computational results for a set of test problems arising from telecommunications applications. We illustrate the value of our branching rule when used to find a heuristic solution and compare branch-and-price and branch-and-price-and-cut methods to find optimal solutions for highly capacitated problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.2.318.12378","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical algorithm for solving a specific mathematical problem related to flow optimization, with no mention of social themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2000","48","2","Michael C.

For example, airlines charge various fares for a common pool of seats. Seasonal products are sold at full or discount prices during different phases of the season. This article presents a model that reflects this yield management problem. The model assumes that (1) products are offered at multiple predetermined prices over time; (2) demand is price sensitive and obeys the Poisson process; and (3) price is allowed to change monotonically, i.e., either the markup or markdown policy is implemented. To maximize the expected revenue, management needs to determine the optimal times to switch between prices based on the remaining season and inventory. Major results in this research include (1) an exact solution for the continuous-time model; (2) piecewise concavity of the value function with respect to time and inventory; and (3) monotonicity of the optimal policy. The implementation of optimal policies is fairly facile because of the existence of threshold points embedded in the value function. The value function and time thresholds can be solved with a reasonable computation effort. Numerical examples are provided.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.2.332.13373","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of yield management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, a package service provider chooses a fixed charge for subscription. An online provider chooses both a fixed charge and a marginal charge, because it is possible to meter usage in that technology. We show that the package provider serves high volume subscribers while the online provider serves low volume subscribers.

For example, a retailer orders a full truckload from a manufacturer to qualify for a quantity discount; a factory has a material handling system that moves full containers of parts from one production stage to the next. In this paper, we derive optimal policies for multi-stage serial and assembly systems where materials flow in fixed batches. The optimal policies have a simple structure, and their parameters can be easily determined. This research extends the multi-echelon inventory theory in several ways. It generalizes the Clark-Scarf model by allowing batch transfers of inventories. Rosling (1989) shows that assembly systems can be interpreted as serial systems under the assumption that there are no setup costs. We show that the series interpretation still holds when materials flow in fixed batches which satisfy a certain regularity condition. Finally, Veinott (1965) identifies an optimal policy for a single-location inventory system with batch ordering.

It must be true that the delivery quantity, Q, is less than the mean demand per period. In order to manage the inventory, the buyer has the option of adjusting the delivery quantity upwards just prior to a delivery, but must pay a premium to do so. Demand is assumed random, and we model the system in a continuous review setting. We show that the equations one must solve to find optimal adjustment strategies are intractable. A diffusion approximation is developed which when coupled with the solution to an even simpler deterministic version of the problem yields very simple but effective approximations. Extensive computations are included to compare the performance of the optimal and approximate policies. We also empirically derive a formula for computing Q whose accuracy is established computationally. We prove that the fixed delivery contract results in lower variance of orders to the seller.

It also includes techniques for finding primal feasible solutions. The Lagrangian heuristic is then embedded into a branch-and-bound scheme that yields further primal improvements. Special penalty tests and cutting criteria are developed. The branch-and-bound scheme can either be an exact method that guarantees the optimal solution of the problem or be a quicker heuristic.

While such an arrangement may enjoy many benefits including reduced customer participation and back room efficiency, it gives rise to the possibility of communication and coordination problems between the front office and the back room. To address such coordination problems, we work from one popular piece of case material in operations management, the National Cranberry Cooperative (NCC) case, and develop and analyze a service facility start-up and capacity model based on a finite-horizon, multistage queueing system. The model allows for general variability that can be either stationary or nonstationary, predictable or unpredictable. We derive the relationships between job start and finish times and primitive parameters and control variables using a sample path construction. We then show that two performance measures, the expected waiting and operating costs, have desirable convexity properties with respect to the control variables; namely, the starting time and the processing capacity of each stage. We also show how to perform marginal analysis on start-up times. Numerical examples based on the NCC case are presented and discussed.

We construct a large-scale simulation model using data from over 30,000 transplants, and the simulation results demonstrate that, relative to the organ allocation policy currently employed in the United States, the dynamic index policy increases the quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduces the mean waiting time until transplantation for all six demographic groups (two sexes, races, and age groups) under consideration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.4.549.12418","","OR","Multidisciplinary","8","['equity', 'inequity', 'demographic groups', 'transplantation']","The article emphasizes the trade-off between clinical efficiency and equity in kidney allocation, highlighting measures of inequity and the impact on various demographic groups.

The same methods apply to networks with positive leadtimes, provided the leadtimes are balanced in a specific sense. We explore networks with general, unbalanced leadtimes. A key result is a lower bound on the cost of any feasible policy. Other results concern policy heuristics and their performance. For a large class of networks, we construct a policy whose cost is within 45% of the lower bound. For general networks, the performance guarantee is 1:02\u221a(1+\u03b7), where \u03b7 is a number dependent on the network topology only.

These constraints enforce the desire of airlines to land certain groups of flights, called banks, within fixed time windows, thus preventing the propagation of delays throughout their entire operation. GH can be formulated as a transportation problem and readily solved. But in the presence of banking constraints, GH becomes a difficult integer programming problem. In this paper, we construct five different models of the single-airport ground-holding problem with banking constraints (GHB). The models are evaluated both computationally and analytically. For two of the models, we show that the banking constraints induce facets of the convex hull of the set of integer solutions.

A set of inequalities are added to one subproblem to tighten the lower bounds and facilitate generating feasible solutions. Subgradient optimization is used to solve the Lagrangian dual. An advanced dual feasible solution is generated to speed up the convergence of the subgradient method.

All jobs have the same routing, and they have to be processed in the same order on each of the machines. The objective is to determine such an order of the jobs, often referred to as a permutation schedule, so as to minimize the total completion time of all jobs on the final machine. We show that when the processing times are statistically exchangeable across machines and independent across jobs, the Shortest ProcessingTime first (SPT) scheduling rule, based on the total service requirement of each job on all M machines, is asymptotically optimal as the total number of jobs goes to infinity. This extends a recent result of Kaminsky and Simchi-Levi (1996), in which a crucial assumption is that the processing times on all M machines for all jobs must be i.i.d.. Our work provides an alternative proof using martingales, which can also be carried out directly to show the asymptotic optimality of the weighted SPT rule for the Flow Shop Weighted Completion Time Problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.4.615.12423","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in operations research without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The inference dual of an optimization problem asks how the optimal value can be deduced from the constraints. In MILP, a deduction based on the resolution method oftheorem proving can be obtained from the branch-and-cut tree that solves the primal problem. One can then investigate which perturbations ofthe problem leave this proof intact. On this basis it is shown that, in a minimization problem, any perturbation that satisfies a certain system of linear inequalities will reduce the optimal value no more than a prespecified amount. One can also give an upper bound on the increase in the optimal value that results from a given perturbation. The method is illustrated on two realistic problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.4.623.12420","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical method for sensitivity analysis in optimization problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We show that the inventory position at the supplier can be easily characterized by a uniform distribution. As a result, the closed-form expected cost function is tractable.

A variety of quantitative approaches have been developed to help managers select sites for biodiversity protection. The problem is often formulated to select the set of reserve sites that maximizes the number of species or ecological communities that are represented, subject to an upper bound on the number or area of selected sites. Most formulations assume that information about the presence or absence of species in the candidate sites is known with certainty. Because complete information typically is lacking, we developed a reserve selection formulation that incorporates probabilistic presence-absence data. The formulation was a discrete 0/1 optimization model that maximized the number of represented vegetation communities subject to a budget constraint, where a community was considered represented if its probability of occurrence in the set of selected sites exceeded a specified minimum reliability threshold. Although the formulation was nonlinear, a log transformation allowed us to represent the problem in a linear format that could be solved using exact optimization methods. The formulation was tested using a moderately sized reserve selection problem based on data from the Superior National Forest in Minnesota.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.5.697.12411","","OR","Multidisciplinary","6","['biodiversity', 'natural areas', 'ecological communities', 'protection']","The article emphasizes the importance of biodiversity protection and ecological considerations in site selection, indicating a moderate focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility.

A fluid model is globally stable if the fluid network eventually empties under each nonidling dispatch policy.

We show that the global stability region is defined by the nominal workload conditions and the \u201cvirtual workload conditions,\u201d and we introduce two intuitively appealing phenomena\u2014virtual stations and push starts\u2014that explain the virtual workload conditions. When any of the workload conditions is violated, we construct a fluid solution that cycles to infinity, showing that the fluid network is unstable. When all the workload conditions are satisfied, we solve a network flow problem to find the coefficients of a piecewise linear Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov function decreases to zero, proving that the fluid level eventually reaches zero under any nonidling dispatch policy. Under certain assumptions on the inter arrival and service time distributions, a queueing network is stable or positive Harris recurrent if the corresponding fluid network is stable.

We investigate three categories of weights: unit, common, and job-specific. For the unit and common weights problems, a polynomial time algorithm is developed. The algorithm takes advantage of identical jobs and finds solutions faster than by standard methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.48.5.788.12405","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling problems without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2000","48","5","J.

We describe models of travel cost and three types of congestion typically experienced in crossdocking terminals, and we use them to construct layouts that minimize the labor cost of transferring freight.

Thus, each week requires a decision to be made at each echelon on how many units to expedite in from the next upstream echelon (to be received immediately) and how many to regular order (to be received in one week), with the remainder detained (left as is). The model can be interpreted as addressing dynamic lead time management, in which the (remaining) effective lead time for each ordered unit can be dynamically reduced by expediting and/or extended. Use of Clark and Scarf's (1960) idea of echelon stocks reduces a complex, multidimensional stocking problem to the analysis of a series of one-dimensional subproblems. What are called top-down base stock policies, which are readily amenable to managerial interpretation, are shown to be optimal. Myopic policies are shown to be optimal in the stationary, in1nite horizon case.

The pattern minimisation problem is significantly more complex, but it is of great practical importance. In this paper, we propose an integer programming formulation for the problem that involves an exponential number of binary variables and associated columns, each of which corresponds to selecting a fixed number of copies of a specific cutting pattern. The integer program is solved using a column generation approach where the subproblem is a nonlinear integer program that can be decomposed into multiple bounded integer knapsack problems. At each node of the branch-and-bound tree, the linear programming relaxation of our formulation is made tighter by adding super-additive inequalities. Branching rules are presented that yield a balanced tree. Incumbent solutions are obtained using a rounding heuristic.

In the case of a homogeneous project consisting of serial subprojects, we show that disaggregating the project and assigning the subprojects to the contractors on a piecemeal basis reduces variance of project duration while leaving the mean unchanged.

The resource-based literature has stressed that only firm-specific human capital is likely to generate organizational rents, since those assets are more likely to be inimitable, rare, and therefore a better basis for sustained competitive advantage. Generalized investments in human capital (i.e., investments in capabilities that people can transfer and deploy to other firms or settings) are to be avoided. However, observing lessons from the literature on psychological contracts and organizational commitment, we argue that generalized investments may have value for the firm through their effects on worker commitment to the firm. The gain in worker commitment is valuable to firms given the fragile state of the contemporary employment relation, in which the lack of job security is likely to breed diminished employee commitment. This is particularly a concern for employment relations consisting of externalized labor (i.e., contract work or selfemployed professionals operating as agents of the firm), in which agent commitment is vital but likely to be more scarce. In this paper we focus on the externalized workers (independent agents) of two insurance firms in addressing these issues. A sample of 237 agents shows support for the benefits of generalized investments on agent commitment, questioning conventional wisdom that such investments should be avoided. We also examine the impact of relation-specific investments and other key antecedents on agent commitment, concluding that a mixture of strategic investments in human capital should be considered, taking into account their impacts on the firm-worker psychological contract. We also examine the impact of agent commitment on agent performance in this context, finding committed agents do provide greater value to the insurer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.1.1.12565","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['human capital', 'employee commitment', 'job security', 'externalized labor']","The article discusses themes of employee commitment and the impacts of job security, which are relevant to DEI and ethical organizational practices.

We propose that workers effectively integrate both types of work by switching, defined as shifting between standardized production and continuous work while on the job in response to situational cues. Alternatively, workers can respond to the challenges of a job involving both types of work by avoiding the continuous improvement work. Switching and avoidance are associated with different performance and attitudinal outcomes. We present evidence drawn from an exploratory field study which suggests that line employees who effectively integrate standardized production and continuous improvement work by switching experienced less job stress and greater job satisfaction.

Alliance instabilities refer to major changes or dissolutions of alliances that are unplanned from the perspective of one or more partners. Although the literature identifies certain characteristics of strategic alliances that may lead to their unplanned dissolution, the extent of our understanding of this subject appears to be fragmented and incomplete. In this article we propose a comprehensive framework for adequately understanding alliance instabilities based on the notion of internal tensions. We suggest that strategic alliances are sites in which conflicting forces develop and which can be viewed as being constituted by three key pairs of competing forces\u2014namely, cooperation versus competition, rigidity versus flexibility, and short-term versus long-term orientation. This tensions framework helps us in explaining the intrinsic vulnerability of alliances in terms of a wide range of internal contradictions and enables us to examine, in an integrated manner, the incidence, dynamics, and eventual dissipation of the inherent instabilities. We discuss the interrelationships among the different internal tensions and their impacts on different types of strategic alliances. We also examine the termination of alliances through mergers/acquisitions and dissolution. Finally, we suggest ways to empirically test the various ideas and propositions developed here and indicate directions for further research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.1.77.12570","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['alliances', 'internal tensions', 'cooperation', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on the theoretical examination of strategic alliances and their instabilities, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Network Cohesion, Structural Holes, and the Adaptation of Social Capital","This paper explores the tension between two opposite views on how networks create social capital. Network closure (Coleman 1988) stresses the role of cohesive ties in fostering a normative environment that facilitates cooperation. Structural hole theory (Burt 1992) sees cohesive ties as a source of rigidity that hinders the coordination of complex organizational tasks. The two theories lead to opposite predictions on how the structure of an actor's network may affect his ability to adapt that network to a significant change in task environment. Using data from a newly created special unit within the Italian subsidiary of a multinational computer manufacturer, we show that managers with cohesive communication networks were less likely to adapt these networks to the change in coordination requirements prompted by their new assignments, which in turn jeopardized their role as facilitators of horizontal cooperation within a newly created business unit structure. We conclude with a discussion of the trade-off between the safety of cooperation within cohesive networks and the flexibility provided by networks rich in structural holes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.2.183.12514","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['social capital', 'cooperation', 'normative environment']","The article discusses social capital and cooperation, which are related to social dynamics and organizational behavior, but it lacks a direct focus on DEI or social justice themes.

In hypercompetitive industries member firms act boldly and aggressively to create a state of competitive disequilibrium.

We then describe the \u201cadaptive sensemaking\u201d practices established in the literature for dealing with temporary turbulence and suggest that in hypercompetition those processes continue indefinitely.

What emerged from our analysis was the importance of cognitive barriers to empowerment. Employees' resistance appeared to be motivated less by intentional self-interest than by the constraints of well-established, ingrained schemas. Resistance was also fueled by skepticism among the employees about management's commitment to the new decision-making schema, especially because employees judged managerial actions to be inconsistent with their new espoused framework. A grounded model of schema change is developed for changes in organizational decision-making schemas during empowerment efforts.

Firms that compete in cultural industries must deal with a combination of ambiguity and dynamism, both of which are intrinsic to goods that serve an aesthetic or expressive rather than a utilitarian purpose. Managers involved with the creation, production, marketing, and distribution of cultural goods must navigate tensions that arise from opposing imperatives that result from these industry characteristics. In this paper we outline five polarities that are shaping organizational practices in cultural industries. First, managers must reconcile expression of artistic values with the economics of mass entertainment. Second, they must seek novelty that differentiates their products without making them fundamentally different in nature from others in the same category. Third, they must analyse and address existing demand while at the same time using their imagination to extend and transform the market. Fourth, they must balance the advantages of vertically integrating diverse activities under one roof against the need to maintain creative vitality through flexible specialization. And finally, they must build creative systems to support and market cultural products but not allow the system to suppress individual inspiration, which is ultimately at the root of creating value in cultural industries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.3.263.12503","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['creativity', 'artistic values', 'cultural goods', 'organizational practices', 'diversity']","The article discusses the complexities of managing cultural industries, emphasizing the balance between artistic expression and economic considerations, which reflects moderate engagement with themes of creativity and diversity in organizational practices.

The multifaceted and specialized identity of the ASO was reinforced by different professional groups in the organization: the ideologies of musicians and administrators emphasized institutional resource allocations consistent with the legitimating values of their professions, i.e., artistic excellence versus economic utility. These identity claims, made under organizational crisis, accounted for variations in the construction of core competencies.

Specifically, we examine the hypothesis that specialists were more active than were generalists in the creation of new film genres in the early years of the American film industry. We find that increased concentration among generalists had a positive effect on foundings of specialist producers and specialist distributors, and that the specialists were more active in the creation of new film genres.

Altogether, this network of organizations\u2014from creators (artists, musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers, theaters), and media outlets\u2014collectively constitute cultural industries.

One normative and three positive questions are posed for a stakeholder theory: The normative question is: Why should stakeholder models be given serious consideration at this moment in history? The positive questions are: (1) Under what conditions is a stakeholder firm likely to emerge in the United States, (2) what are the critical determinants of performance in a stakeholder firm, and (3) what will determine the sustainability and diffusion of this organizational form in the American environment? The history, design features, and dynamics of the labormanagement partnership at Saturn are used to illustrate and interpret a specific case of employees as stakeholders. Saturn's original mission, governance structure, and internal processes fit the characteristics of a stakeholder firm. Employees establish themselves as influential, definitive stakeholders by using their knowledge to improve organizational performance. The local union likewise contributes to firm performance by organizing workers into a dense social network that contributes to problem solving, conflict resolution, and quality improvement. However, the legal and political environment in which the firm operates produces considerable uncertainty over the sustainability and diffusion of Saturn's features in particular, and the stakeholder organizational form in general. Additional hypotheses and research questions are proposed to continue theory building around the more general model of the stakeholder firm. Researchers are encouraged to take up the analysis of stakeholder models and thereby contribute to the contemporary and future debates over the role of the corporation in American society.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.4.367.14601","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['stakeholder', 'employees', 'social network', 'performance', 'sustainability']","The article emphasizes the role of stakeholders, particularly employees and unions, in enhancing organizational performance and addresses the normative question of why stakeholder models should be considered, reflecting themes of social responsibility and equity.

More recently, the scholarly spotlight seems to have shifted from formal modes of employee resistance to more informal or routine forms of workplace resistance. This paper presents a detailed ethnographic account of informal resistance and its ability to limit managerial control in a health maintenance organization undergoing the computerization of its administrative functions. Our study adopts a more problematic approach to understanding routine resistance, tracing its discursive constitution in the workplace. Using the findings of an ethnographic study involving observation and interviews, we show how routine resistance was discursively constituted and how it limited organizational control in interesting and unexpected ways. This discursive constitution was achieved through (a) owning resistance, (b) naming resistance, and (c) designating indirect resistance. The paper also analyzes how these different discursive constructions limited managerial control by affirming autonomous self-identities, renegotiating roles and relationships, and reinterpreting dominant managerial discourses. Finally, broader implications for understanding routine resistance in organizations are drawn.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.4.387.14597","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['resistance', 'autonomous self-identities', 'managerial control', 'discursive constitution']","The article discusses workplace resistance and its implications for managerial control, highlighting themes of autonomy and identity.

To date, research has not explained adequately why entrepreneurs discover these opportunities, which creates several conceptual problems in the entrepreneurship literature. Drawing on Austrian economics, I argue that opportunity discovery is a function of the distribution of information in society (Hayek 1945). Through in-depth case studies of eight sets of entrepreneurs who exploit a single MIT invention, I show that entrepreneurs discover opportunities related to the information that they already possess. I use these findings to draw several implications that differ from those prevailing in the entrepreneurship literature, including: (1) entrepreneurs do not always select between alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) the source of entrepreneurship lies in differences in information about opportunities; (3) the results of prior studies of entrepreneurial exploitation may suffer from bias; and (4) individual differences influence the opportunities that people discover, how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the government can influence this process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.4.448.14602","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['entrepreneurship', 'information', 'bias']","The article discusses entrepreneurship and the distribution of information but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

They are typically assigned tasks that are strategically important and highly complex. They rarely meet in person, conducting almost all of their interaction and decision making using communications technology. Although they play an increasingly important role in multinational organizations, little systematic is known about their dynamics or effectiveness. This study built a grounded theory of global virtual team processes and performance over time. We built a template based on Adaptive Structuration Theory (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) to guide our research, and we conducted a case study, observing three global virtual teams over a period of 21 months. Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each configured by aspects of the team's structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a fit among an interaction incident's form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-to-face incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media. These two insights are discussed with respect to other literature and are elaborated upon in several propositions. Implications for research and practice are also outlined.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.5.473.15200","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['global virtual teams', 'communication', 'effectiveness']","The article discusses global virtual teams and their dynamics, which touches on aspects of collaboration and communication across diverse, international groups.

In contrast, theories of victimization suggest that other factors may also determine why certain individuals are more frequently harmed than others. For example, there may be situational factors that contribute to an environment that allows or fails to inhibit harmful actions. Other incidents of workplace harm may be consciously or unconsciously influenced by the victims themselves. This empirical study extends previous research on harmful workplace behavior by examining whether the situational variable of job status and the dispositional characteristics of aggressiveness and negative affectivity predict self-perceived victimization. Based on research in criminal victimology, we hypothesized that an employee's job status would be significantly related to perceived victimization. Research on victims of bullying was the basis for the predicted effects of negative affectivity and aggressiveness. Data were provided by a randomly selected sample of employees from a city government who completed a survey as part of an organizational assessment. We performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on employee responses to develop suitable measures of victimization. The analyses revealed that perceived victimization took either direct (e.g., name-calling) or indirect (e.g., sabotaging work) forms. Hierarchical regression was used to test the study hypotheses. Results showed that job status did not significantly influence perceived victimization. However, employees who were high in aggressiveness and negative affectivity perceived higher levels of victimization than those who were low in these traits. Implications for organizations are discussed and future research directions are offered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.5.525.15205","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['victimization', 'workplace', 'harmful behavior', 'aggressiveness', 'negative affectivity']","The article examines victimization in the workplace, highlighting harmful interpersonal behaviors and their impact on individuals, which aligns with themes of social justice and workplace ethics.

Study 1 examined the extent to which two firms that differed solely in the decision behavior of a routine would also differ in organizational (quasiresolution of conflict, uncertainty avoidance, problem-driven search, and organizational learning) and economic (profit, price, market share, cost) measures and impacts. Three such manipulations were separately examined, where each manipulation altered the relative propensity of the firm to be more or less reactive to three events: production growth pressure, price adjustment under organizational goal conflict, and initial price adjustment under profit goal failure. Analysis of the behaviors revealed how subtle changes in these key routines could generate complex organizational and economic effects that impact firm success. The dominant result demonstrated that organizations that did not perform well organizationally did not perform well economically. In addition, higher reactivity resulted in higher costs, in part because of quantified organizational constructs (e.g., slack, pressure). Study 2 examined the data from the first study to determine the extent to which the performance of the duopoly was consistent with a set of eight stylized economic facts drawn from the empirical literature on oligopoly. Study 2 demonstrated consistency with five of the eight stylized economic facts and provided partial support for two others. We conclude that behavioral constructs of ABTOF, as articulated in the Cyert-March duopoly model, provide behavior and performance capabilities that bridge the gap between game-theoretic models of duopoly and the computational and informational realities of organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.5.565.15201","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational and economic insights without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I present descriptions of routines that change as participants respond to outcomes of previous iterations of a routine. Based on the changes in these routines I propose a performative model of organizational routines. This model suggests that there is an internal dynamic to routines that can promote continuous change. The internal dynamic is based on the inclusion of routine participants as agents. When we do not separate the people who are doing the routines from the routine, we can see routines as a richer phenomenon. Change occurs as a result of participants' reflections on and reactions to various outcomes of previous iterations of the routine. This perspective introduces agency into the notion of routine.

(2) Unlike in the efficiency domain, however, learning in the domain of product reliability is primarily a function of time, and not of how many cars have gone down the assembly line.

The discrepancy between what researchers think about the incorporation of temporal factors in their research and what they actually do was explained by various pragmatic, methodological, and normative grounds, but they were not aware of other epistemological and ontological barriers related to their choice. The interviews also drew attention to a paradox that stemmed from an experience of ongoing tension between the methodologically prescribed sense of time and the experientially lived impression of time. Further analysis suggests that incorporation of time factors may significantly improve social process research. The study demonstrates that temporal elements do not merely change one's perception of a situation, but also provide a space for a richer and more meaningful interpretation by enabling an improved association of a particular event with one's personal frame of reference and lived experience. In addition, the study suggests that an awareness of the various approaches to time and the application of a consistent ontological framework to the analysis of social phenomena are likely to increase the coherence and congruity of the analysis. No particular perception of time is prescribed here. The emphasis is on self-awareness of the implications of temporalities on social phenomena and on ontological consistency in our research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.6.665.12532","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['lived experience', 'social inquiry', 'normative', 'temporal factors']","The article discusses the importance of incorporating lived experiences and temporal factors into social inquiry, which aligns with themes of self-awareness and normative considerations in research.

Because many scholars remain uncertain as to just what this controversial perspective is, the present article offers a straightforward explanation of postmodernism's basic themes. Additionally, the author attempts to provide some balance to the overwhelmingly sympathetic presentations of postmodernism in the organization theory literature by offering a critical assessment of how it would redirect the study of organizations. Consistent with an intellectual divide dating to the Enlightenment, while those engaged in \u201cnormal science\u201d are concerned with the question of what is true, it appears that those who sympathize with postmodernism are addressing the question of what is good. Postmodernists, it is argued here, wish to engage in advocacy for values and preferences that they view as putting them in radical opposition to the status quo. To facilitate such advocacy they call for the repudiation of \u201cmodernism,\u201d in particular the key modernist notion that there is an objective truth that can be sought out rationally and systematically. Postmodernists adopt, instead, a relativist philosophy, which contends that \u201ctruth\u201d must be considered merely subjective, such that one's view of truth is only relative to one's circumstances. Although taking the position that no one can say what is or is not \u201ctrue\u201d puts them in opposition to mainstream science, it supports their ability to discredit views they oppose, and simultaneously provides a defense against those who would claim that the postmodernist's view is not \u201ctrue.\u201d Whether the postmodernist approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of organizations is addressed here by examining its philosophical and historical roots, the research and theory that it has so far inspired, and the critical commentary on our field that its adherents have offered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.6.709.12534","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['postmodernism', 'advocacy', 'values', 'subjective truth', 'radical opposition']","The article discusses postmodernism's advocacy for values that challenge the status quo, emphasizing subjective interpretations of truth over objective ones.

I too worry that shallow works given even more shallow and opportunistic readings can have negative social consequences. But I also recognize that most of Weiss's concerns are not unique to postmodern writings. Many of the problems he discusses could also be descriptive of work from different conceptual and methodological stances. Statistics are often contrived and misleading. Ethnography has at times aided colonization. Both social and physical sciences have at times produced bad theories and been put to very negative uses. Some early postmodernist theorists, Christians, and scientists, were Nazis, and elements of each of their fundamental conceptions could be co-opted to support this particular form of barbarism. This potential utilization, however, does not lead for me to a blanket condemnation of postmodernism, science, ethnography, religion, or statistics. Devotees of each have used their special understandings to fight tyranny. Both postmodernism and science also draw on fundamental conceptions that are productive, enable open choices, and help us see through the masters and ideologies of a particular time and place. I am less interested in blame than in finding what each can contribute. I look to an ongoing community discussion that helps us to do the best we can to sort out the good from the bad, and I hope that the current set of essays helps stimulate a positive dialogue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.6.732.12536","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['community', 'social consequences', 'dialogue', 'tyranny', 'postmodernism']","The article discusses the social implications of various theoretical frameworks and emphasizes the importance of community dialogue in addressing negative social consequences, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social justice and ethical considerations in organizational science."],["2000","9","1","M.

Order picking is the retrieval of items from their warehouse storage locations to satisfy customer orders. Five order picking policies, strict order, batch, sequential zone, batch zone, and wave, are evaluated using labor requirements, processing time, and customer service as performance measures. A simulation model was developed to investigate these picking policies in a mail order environment. Prior research has focused on the study of individual picking policies. This study extends the prior research by evaluating multiple picking policies under varying operating conditions. The results of the study seem to indicate that (1) wave picking and batch picking perform well across the range of operating conditions considered in this study, and (2) sequential zone and batch zone picking do not perform well, especially as the order volume increases. However, the benefits and drawbacks to each picking policy must be taken into account.

A simulation model of a job shop was used to test the modified SPT rule. The performance measures evaluated were mean flow time, flow time variance, and mean lateness. Conditions under which the SPT modification improved results were as follows: large number of transfer batches, small setup time to process time ratio, and large variation in process times from station to station. The results suggest that shop loading is not a significant factor affecting performance of the modified SPT rule.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2000.tb00462.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of process management and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our results also contradict the finding of a previous study, which showed that Dual\u2010kanban performed better than Single\u2010kanban. The different findings can, however, be attributed to the use of a material transfer policy, which favors the Dual\u2010kanban modeled in the previous study.

We provide a unified framework to simultaneously investigate asymmetric volatility at the firm and the market level and to examine two potential explanations of the asymmetry: leverage effects and volatility feedback. Our empirical application uses the market portfolio and portfolios with different leverage constructed from Nikkei 225 stocks. We reject the pure leverage model of Christie (1982) and find support for a volatility feedback story. Volatility feedback at the firm level is enhanced by strong asymmetries in conditional covariances. Conditional betas do not show significant asymmetries. We document the risk premium implications of these findings.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/1/1/1584172","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of equity market volatility and risk without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Estimates indicate that up to 85% of the spread is variable cost and that the marginal spread is rising. Further, offerings that are likely to require greater underwriting services encounter higher marginal spreads. These findings are consistent with there being a family of U-shaped spreads, with lower quality offerings priced on higher spreads, unlike the economies of scale view of spreads.

All three types of firms tend to have funds in excess of industry norms before the events.

The analysis of the stock price reaction suggests that large incremental disbursements mitigate the agency problem associated with excess funds.

We estimate firm values using models that have been shown in other contexts to generate relatively precise estimates of value. We find that these methods generally yield unbiased estimates of value, but the dispersion of valuation errors is very wide - the sample ratio of estimated value to market value varies from less than 20% to greater than 250%. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the variation in these errors is related to empirical proxies for claimholders' incentives to overstate or understate the firm's value.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/1/43/1584519","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical valuation methods for bankrupt firms without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations, which are typically associated with 'woke' themes."],["2000","13","1","Michael A.

A set of such solutions results in a multidimensional approximation that is extremely accurate and very quick to compute.

We propose, instead, a more direct mechanism of influencing bank risk-taking incentives, in which the FDIC insurance premium scheme incorporates incentive features of top-management compensation. With this scheme, we show that bank owners choose an optimal management compensation structure that induces first-best value-maximizing investment choices by a bank's management. We explicitly characterize the parameters of the optimal management compensation structure and the fairly priced FDIC insurance premium in the presence of a single or multiple sources of agency problems.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/1/95/1585146","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bank regulation and management compensation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Two-fund separation theorems suggest a natural definition for trading activity: share turnover. If two-fund separation holds, share turnover must be identical for all securities. If (K+1)-fund separation holds, we show that turnover satisfies an approximately linear K-factor structure. These implications are examined empirically using individual weekly turnover data for NYSE and AMEX securities from 1962 to 1996. We find strong evidence against two-fund separation, and a principal-components decomposition suggests that turnover is well approximated by a two-factor linear model.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/257/2964874","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio theory and trading volume without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Firm risk is endogenous and renegotiated interest rates on the debt need not be monotone in firm risk. The initial terms of the debt are not set to price default risk but rather are set to efficiently balance bargaining power in later renegotiation.

In contrast to multifactor models, random field models offer a parsimonious description of term structure dynamics, while eliminating the self-inconsistent practice of recalibration. The form of the drift of the instantaneous forward rate process necessary to preclude arbitrage under the risk-neutral measure is obtained. Forward risk-adjusted measures are identified and used to price a bond option when the forward volatility structure depends on the square root of the current spot rate. Several classes of tractable random field models are presented.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/365/1593185","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Dealers face a classic adverse selection problem, because some traders have private information regarding the asset value while other traders are uninformed. When dealers cannot communicate outside the market, they price the asset competitively and the market is generally informationally efficient. When dealers communicate privately between periods, they collude successfully to widen spreads and increase profit. Another treatment permits traders to post limit orders, while still allowing dealers to communicate. Limit orders restore informational efficiency and narrow spreads but cause dealers to earn negative trading profits.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/385/1593460","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset markets and trading behaviors without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

More precisely, we assume that the investor's preferences admit an expected utility representation, but with subjective (unknown) probabilities, and investigate what joint restrictions can be placed on utility functions and beliefs. If the investor draws utility from intertemporal consumption, we show that the set of utility functions and beliefs that are consistent with a given consumption choice can be characterized by a martingale condition. In the Markovian case, this characterization can be restated in terms of a Riccati differential equation that must be satisfied by the investor's relative risk aversion function. To each solution of this differential equation is associated a unique utility function and a unique set of beliefs supporting the given consumption choice. Moreover, we show that the differential equation has at most one solution in the class of utility functions displaying infinite absolute risk aversion at the origin. Thus, preferences (and associated beliefs) can be uniquely recovered within this class.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/417/1593954","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investor preferences and beliefs without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We empirically derive risk aversion functions implied by options prices and realized returns on the S&P500 index simultaneously. These risk aversion functions dramatically change shapes around the 1987 crash: Precrash, they are positive and decreasing in wealth and largely consistent with standard assumptions made in economic theory. Postcrash, they are partially negative and partially increasing and irreconcilable with those assumptions. Mispricing in the option market is the most likely cause. Simulated trading strategies exploiting this mispricing show excess returns, even after accounting for the possibility of further crashes, transaction costs, and hedges against the downside risk.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/433/1594235","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically risk aversion and option pricing, with no mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In this article we provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence that government foreign exchange interventions create significant adverse selection problems for dealers. In particular, our model shows that the adverse selection component of the foreign exchange spread is positively related to the variance of unexpected intervention and that expected intervention has no impact on the spread. After controlling for inventory and order processing costs, we find that bid-ask spreads increase with U.S. dollar and German deutsche mark foreign exchange rate intervention during the period 1976\u20131994. Furthermore, when the intervention is decomposed into expected and unexpected components, we find a statistically and economically significant increase in spreads with the variance of unexpected intervention, while expected intervention has no significant impact on spreads.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/2/453/1594434","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of foreign exchange markets and government interventions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our results are valid after controlling for time decay and market microstructure effects.

It provides the first readily computed option formula for a random volatility model that can be estimated and implemented solely on the basis of observables. The single lag version of this model contains Heston's (1993) stochastic volatility model as a continuous-time limit. Empirical analysis on S&P500 index options shows that the out-of-sample valuation errors from the single lag version of the GARCH model are substantially lower than the ad hoc Black\u2013Scholes model of Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (1998) that uses a separate implied volatility for each option to fit to the smirk/smile in implied volatilities. The GARCH model remains superior even though the parameters of the GARCH model are held constant and volatility is filtered from the history of asset prices while the ad hoc Black\u2013Scholes model is updated every period. The improvement is largely due to the ability of the GARCH model to simultaneously capture the correlation of volatility, with spot returns and the path dependence in volatility.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/3/585/1576522","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model for option valuation without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

In a multiperiod model with endogenous (and costly) information acquisition.

Constrained consumption-portfolio optimization techniques are adapted to incorporate redundant, possibly mispriced securities. Under logarithmic preferences, we provide explicit conditions for mispricing and closed-form expressions for all economic quantities. Existence of an equilibrium where mispricing occurs with positive probability is verified in a specific case. In a more general setting, we demonstrate the necessity of mispricing for equilibrium when agents are heterogeneous enough. The construction of a representative agent with stochastic weights allows us to characterize prices and allocations, given mispricing occurs.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/3/715/1577749","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on equilibrium and mispricing in capital markets, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2000","13","3","Naveen Khanna\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Naveen Khanna\n            \u2004\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Michigan State University\n    \n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Naveen Khanna, 320 Eppley Center, Eli Broad College of Business, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, or e-mail: khanna@pilot.msu.edu.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Sheri Tice\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Sheri Tice\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Tulane University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        We wish to thank Judy Chevalier, Simi Kedia, Bob Korajczyk, Hamid Mehran, Mitch Petersen, Gordon Phillips, Todd Pulvino, Raghuram Rajan, Artur Raviv, Assem Safiieddine, David Scharfstein, Peter Schmidt, Richard Simonds, Anil Shivdasani, Laura Starks, Luigi Zingales, the participants at the WFA, SFS, and NBER meetings, seminars participants at University of Iowa, Michigan State University, SUNY Binghampton, and Tulane University, editor Sheridan Titman, and two anonymous referees for their many important contributions.

Data comes from the discount department store industry where Wal-Mart entered a large number of markets in a short period of time. Consistent with existing research, larger and more profitable incumbents respond more aggressively to Wal-Mart's entry, while more highly levered incumbents respond less aggressively. Also, there is evidence that incumbent managers fight harder (possibly overinvest) when their job is at greater risk and high managerial ownership appears to reduce this agency problem. Incumbent firms behave differently in markets under attack by Wal-Mart than in markets not yet threatened, suggesting that some of the documented responses are specific to Wal-Mart's entry.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/3/749/1578235","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial and strategic responses of firms to market competition without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

It is shown that, unlike in the borrower's commitment problem to keep borrowing from the same bank in \u201cgood\u201d times, the increased competition may strengthen a bank's incentive to keep its commitment. Banks offer loans with commitment to the highest quality borrowers but, when faced with competition from bond markets, they also give these loans to lower quality borrowers. An increase in the number of banks has a non-monotonic effect; new banks reinforce a bank's incentive only if there are a small number of banks.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/3/781/1578980","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit markets and bank competition without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that in the presence of contracting costs such rules can increase efficiency. We first show in a private information model that a borrower can reduce overall costs of finance by letting informationally heterogeneous lenders choose between junior and senior debt. In particular, we find that debt priorities reduce socially wasteful information gathering by investors. We then argue why, particularly in banking, legal standardization of debt priorities may be superior to bilateral private arrangements.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/3/813/1579309","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bankruptcy law and efficiency in finance without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The equilibrium depth can take values ranging from 0 to infinity, depending on the information asymmetry, the asset volatility, and the strength of the liquidity demand, while the spread remains positive and finite.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/13/4/1129/1588714","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market making and information asymmetry without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2000","13","4","Sandra Betton\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Sandra Betton\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Concordia University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    B.

Rival bids arrive quickly and produce large bid jumps. Greater bidder toeholds (prebid ownership of target shares) reduce the probability of competition and target resistance and are associated with both lower bid premiums and lower prebid target stock price runups. The expected payoff to target shareholders is increasing in the bid premium and in the probability of competition, but decreasing in the bidder's toehold. The initial bidder's expected payoff is significantly positive in the \u201crival-bidder-win\u201d outcome, in part reflecting gains from the pending toehold sale.

We show that sequencing flexibility is beneficial to firm owners, and that the optimal sequencing of restructuring negotiations involves exploiting the firm's liabilities to some creditors so as to moderate the demands of others. Moderately distressed firms will eschew renegotiations with creditors in strong bargaining positions. Severely distressed firms will extract concessions from all creditors.

We compare resource complementarity, status similarity, and social capital as a basis of alliance formation. The findings indicate that the likelihood of investment banks\u2019 alliance formation is positively related to the complementarity of their capabilities, as well as their status similarity. Social capital arising from banks\u2019 direct and indirect collaborative experiences also plays a very important role in alliance formation. The number of deals given by a lead bank to a potential partner over the past three years has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the probability that the lead bank will invite the potential partner to form an alliance. Our findings indicate that status similarity and social capital have a stronger effect on alliance formation in initial public offering deals than in secondary offering deals, as the former are more uncertain than the latter. Using these findings, we discuss the role of complementarity, status similarity, and social capital in alliance formation.

This question has gained prominence within the strategic management field because of the apparent link between capital structure and the ability of firms to compete. By integrating models from organizational economics with the strategic management literature, we are able to theorize that a firm\u2019s capital structure is influenced by environmental dynamism, and that the match between environmental dynamism and capital structure is associated with superior economic performance. Our large-scale empirical analyses provide supportive evidence for the proposition that competitive environments moderate the relationship between capital structure and economic performance. From a theoretical standpoint, these findings provide another link between capital structure and corporate strategy. More importantly, we are able to move the discussion beyond the limitations of financial risk and incorporate the strategy concept of decision making under uncertainty. For practical application, these findings offer informed advice for managers on how to craft a capital structure.

We show the relationships between diversification and performance change over time through the use of multiple time periods and accounting for keiretsu membership. Results show that while diversity strategies vary between keiretsu and non-keiretsu firms, performance is not much different. Across time periods, performance varies considerably, but strategies are less variable. Product diversity has weak effects on firm performance only in one time period, while international diversification has negative profitability and positive growth consequences in in some periods. These results suggest first that diversification strategies and their effects on performance vary across time periods and generally produce some unexpected findings.

We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed \u2018best practice\u2019). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.

Adoption is driven by initial conditions, time-varying internal and external environmental conditions, and convergence (firms positioned least favorably adopt most aggressively). While accounting for initial conditions is critical, managers are sensitive to idiosyncratic environmental cues.

Thus, in the context of initial learning of a capability, there is generally no clear-cut or automatic answer to the question of when an organization should be expected to cut back its learning efforts and affirm that the desired capability has been achieved. This paper offers a simple conceptual model for this question, based on the satisficing principle. More specifically, the question addressed is: \u2018When does overt learning stop?\u2019\u2014where \u2018overt\u2019 learning is understood as being marked by observable allocation of attention and resources to the task of acquiring the capability. The model provides the framework for a discussion of various influences on the aspiration level in the satisficing model, and hence on the nature of the capability that has been achieved when learning stops.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266%28200010/11%2921%3A10/11%3C981%3A%3AAID-SMJ125%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model related to organizational learning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This insight suggests that if firms are heterogeneous they will differ in the net benefits they receive from agglomerating. We argue that firms with the best technologies, human capital, training programs, suppliers, or distributors will gain little, yet competitively suffer when their technologies, employees, and access to supporting industries spill over to competitors. Therefore, these firms have little motivation to geographically cluster despite the existence of agglomeration economies. Conversely, firms with the weakest technologies, human capital, training programs, suppliers, or distributors have little to lose and a lot to gain; therefore, these firms are motivated to geographically cluster. As a result, when firms are heterogeneous we expect agglomeration to be characterized by adverse selection. We find supportive evidence of these arguments by examining the location choice and survival of foreign greenfield investments in U.S. manufacturing industries.

We derive three competing models from the literature and empirically assess these using meta-analytic data drawn from 55 previously published studies. The results of our tests indicate that moderate levels of diversification yield higher levels of performance than either limited or extensive diversification. Thus, we provide support for the curvilinear model; that is, performance increases as firms shift from single-business strategies to related diversification, but performance decreases as firms change from related diversification to unrelated diversification. The results also indicate major effects from variation in diversification and performance operationalizations.

We find that partners are more likely to reorganize or take over link alliances than scale alliances. By contrast, scale alliances are more likely to continue without material changes.

At the same time firms want to protect themselves from the opportunistic behavior of their partner to retain their own core proprietary assets. Most research has generally viewed the achievement of these objectives as mutually exclusive. In contrast, we provide empirical evidence using large-sample survey data to show that when firms build relational capital in conjunction with an integrative approach to managing conflict, they are able to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Relational capital based on mutual trust and interaction at the individual level between alliance partners creates a basis for learning and know-how transfer across the exchange interface. At the same time, it curbs opportunistic behavior of alliance partners, thus preventing the leakage of critical know-how between them.

Where does it lead?","Research into network formation generally takes one of two approaches. Either it examines the outcomes of variations in the context and motives of the formation without examining the dynamics of the process, or it identifies the sequence of activities during the formation but does not examine variations within the formation. In this paper we complement both approaches by examining variations within the formation process and their consequences. We take an exploratory approach. Our analysis of survey data collected on the formation process of 53 R&D consortia reveals two distinct formation paths. The first involves emergent processes, developing from changes in the environment and a common interest and similar views among potential members. In the second, the process appears to be engineered\u2014a triggering entity actively recruits potential members to join in the consortium.

We hypothesize that startups can enhance their early performance by 1) establishing alliances, 2) configuring them into an efficient network that provides access to diverse information and capabilities with minimum costs of redundancy, conflict, and complexity, and 3) judiciously allying with potential rivals that provide more opportunity for learning and less risk of intra-alliance rivalry. An analysis of Canadian biotech startups\u2019 performance provides broad support for our hypotheses, especially as they relate to innovative performance. Overall, our findings show how variation in the alliance networks startups configure at the time of their founding produces significant differences in their early performance, contributing directly to an explanation of how and why firm age and size affect firm performance. We discuss some clear, but challenging, implications for managers of startups.

The case of alliances","We investigate whether firms learn to manage interfirm alliances as experience accumulates. We use contract-specific experience measures in a data set of over 2000 joint ventures and licensing agreements, and value creation measures derived from the abnormal stock returns surrounding alliance announcements. Learning effects are identified from the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in alliance capabilities. We find evidence of large learning effects in managing joint ventures, but no such evidence for licensing contracts. The effects of learning on value creation are strongest for research joint ventures, and weakest for marketing joint ventures. These results are consistent with the view that learning effects are more important in situations characterized by greater contractual ambiguity.

In this paper we examine the \u2018black box\u2019 of knowledge sharing within Toyota\u2019s network and demonstrate that Toyota\u2019s ability to effectively create and manage network-level knowledge-sharing processes at least partially explains the relative productivity advantages enjoyed by Toyota and its suppliers. We provide evidence that suppliers do learn more quickly after participating in Toyota\u2019s knowledge-sharing network. Toyota\u2019s network has solved three fundamental dilemmas with regard to knowledge sharing by devising methods to (1) motivate members to participate and openly share valuable knowledge (while preventing undesirable spillovers to competitors), (2) prevent free riders, and (3) reduce the costs associated with finding and accessing different types of valuable knowledge. Toyota has done this by creating a strong network identity with rules for participation and entry into the network. Most importantly, production knowledge is viewed as the property of the network. Toyota\u2019s highly interconnected, strong tie network has established a variety of institutionalized routines that facilitate multidirectional knowledge flows among suppliers. Our study suggests that the notion of a dynamic learning capability that creates competitive advantage needs to be extended beyond firm boundaries. Indeed, if the network can create a strong identity and coordinating rules, then it will be superior to a firm as an organizational form at creating and recombining knowledge due to the diversity of knowledge that resides within a network.

We argue that the roles relational and structural embeddedness play in firm performance can only be understood with reference to the other. Moreover, we argue that the influence of these factors on firm performance is contingent on industry context. More specifically, our empirical analysis suggests that strong ties in a highly interconnected strategic alliance network negatively impact firm performance. This network configuration is especially suboptimal for firms in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, strong and weak ties are positively related to firm performance in the steel and semiconductor industries, respectively.

Drawing from contingency and resource-based arguments in the strategy and organizational theory literatures, we propose a distinctive analytical approach to identify environmental and organizational contingencies that should predict changes in a firm's strategy and the performance implications of such changes. We test our model using extensive longitudinal data from over 4000 U.S. savings and loan institutions during a period when many S&Ls considered changing strategic direction. The findings support our model of dynamic strategic fit. Specifically, we find that (1) the timing, direction, and magnitude of strategic changes can be logically predicted based on differences in specific environmental forces and organizational resources, and (2) organizations that deviated from our model's prediction of dynamic strategic fit (i.e., changed more or changed less than our model prescribed) experienced negative performance consequences.

The ability of each party to achieve its goals depend upon the relative bargaining power in the relationship established by the contract. Using transaction cost economics and Porter's (1980) characterization of sources of bargaining power, this paper argues that the franchisor can make investments in activities such as tapered integration and buyer selection to increase its bargaining power and decrease conflict and litigation in a franchise system. Specifically, tapered integration (owning some units while franchising others), selecting inexperienced franchisees, and employing a long training program are predicted to increase the franchisor's bargaining power and the franchisee's compliance with franchisor standards.

First, agency theory serves as the basis for a model that predicts the use of monitoring mechanisms and incentive compensation. Then, it is argued that these mechanisms are insufficient for managing subsidiaries characterized by high levels of intra-firm international interdependence, the management of which is critical to many of today's complex global firms. A second set of hypotheses is argued, linking international interdependence to several social control mechanisms. Primary and secondary data from U.S. based multinational corporations were used to test both sets of hypotheses. The results indicate that agency theory, although a useful foundation for studies of control within MNCs, is limited in its ability to explain fully the phenomenon of foreign subsidiary control, however, the model based on intra-firm interdependence had much greater predictive ability.

We find that entry and post-entry strategies affect the longevity of firms and of foreign equity holdings, but in different manners. While the ownership arrangements and organizational structure affect the likelihood of divestment, they exert no significant effect upon closure. The entry mode exerts opposite effects on the two modes of exit, greenfield entrants being more likely to shutdown, but less likely to be divested. Only human capital affects closure and divestment in the same manner. Firms with large endowments of human capital are less likely to exit, irrespective of the exit mode considered.

In addition, managers must choose the degree to which they periodically cull the product line. Vigorous selection removes poor performers from the product line, but this action simultaneously impairs the firm's ability to monitor changes in consumer preferences. Empirical evidence from the computer workstation industry reveals that the ideal choice of product variety depends on the competitive ecology of the industry.

We argue that dominant logic addresses the problem of balancing the needs of business units against those of the corporation as a whole. We also suggest that the presence of a clear and consistent dominant logic must lead to a high degree of consistency in the strategic moves that are undertaken by each of the business units within the diversified firm. Based on a study of the joint ventures initiated by General Electric between 1984 and 1993, we show that the design of these ventures follows a pattern that is consistent with the presence and influence of dominant logic. Finally, we demonstrate that the early failure of joint ventures can generally be linked to a shift away from this dominant logic.

This inconsistency may be due to flawed empirical analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate a particular flaw in existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance. These studies estimate the effect of CSR by regressing firm performance on corporate social performance, and several control variables. This model is misspecified because it does not control for investment in R&D, which has been shown to be an important determinant of firm performance. This misspecification results in upwardly biased estimates of the financial impact of CSR. When the model is properly specified, we find that CSR has a neutral impact on financial performance.

It argues that alliances are access relationships, and therefore that the advantages which a focal firm derives from a portfolio of strategic coalitions depend upon the resource profiles of its alliance partners. In particular, large firms and those that possess leading-edge technological resources are posited to be the most valuable associates. The paper also argues that alliances are both pathways for the exchange of resources and signals that convey social status and recognition. Particularly when one of the firms in an alliance is a young or small organization or, more generally, an organization of equivocal quality, alliances can act as endorsements: they build public confidence in the value of an organization's products and services and thereby facilitate the firm's efforts to attract customers and other corporate partners. The findings from models of sales growth and innovation rates in a large sample of semiconductor producers confirm that organizations with large and innovative alliance partners perform better than otherwise comparable firms that lack such partners. Consistent with the status-transfer arguments, the findings also demonstrate that young and small firms benefit more from large and innovative strategic alliance partners than do old and large organizations.

We further refine our expectations by considering the transitional economic context of our study and the somewhat unique managerial values resulting from the legacy of Marxist ideology. Results from structural equation modeling suggest that an imbalance in the management control structure between the parents leads to parental conflict and an increased likelihood of IJV failure. An imbalance in the ownership control structure, however, had no influence on conflict or survival. In general, support from the foreign parent is positively related to IJV learning and IJV survival. However, higher levels of technical support provided by the foreign parent to the IJV reduced the level of parental conflict, whereas management support had no effect on conflict. Our results suggest some dilemmas for firms pursuing IJVs in transitional economies. Although the foreign parent often contributes critical resources to the IJV, providing it with bargaining power and a high level of influence, an imbalance in management control between the partners may ultimately be detrimental to IJV survival.

On one hand, case studies can identify a competence, but with their small sample size, their retrospective research design, and their tendency toward sampling on the dependent variable, they can not reliably test the causal connection between a competence and its antecedents or its consequences. On the other hand, variance decomposition studies demonstrate the existence of firm-specific performance differentials but have not identified which particular competencies are responsible for them. The present paper avoids both of these problems by measuring a particular competence across a large sample of organizations over a long period of time, so that a test of statistical causality can be applied to the relationship of this competence to both its antecedents and its consequences. The particular competence studied is the ability of money market mutual funds to forecast changes in short-term interest rates\u2014a competence known from prior research to be both valuable and rare. In particular, we test the effect of forecasting ability on the economic surplus generated by the fund and its growth.

The strategic group concept provides an answer to this intriguing question. Researchers in strategic group theory argue that firms within the same strategic group are behaviorally similar and thus tend to compete more fiercely within the group than across groups. In this paper, we focus on the question whether firms within the same group show similar decision-making characteristics. Strategic-choice theorists argue that top management teams in firms have substantial discretion in determining the future strategic contour of firms. Upper-echelon theorists also argue that top managers are the strategists who set the direction of firms and the pace of competition in the industry. Further, they argue that top management team characteristics are an important element that determines the market niche in which a firm competes and the strategic direction a firm follows. Based on these arguments, we expect that there will be a significant link between grouping of firms by the patterns of competitive interactions and grouping of firms by top management team heterogeneity.

Using sociometric techniques and event history analysis, this study predicts the rate at which new interunit linkages are created between a newly formed unit and all the existing units in a large multinational organization. Two important constructs: social capital, derived from the literature on social structure and network formation, and strategic relatedness, derived from research on diversification and the resource-based view of the firm, are used to explain the rate of new linkage creation.

The realist paradigm currently dominates strategy research, and constructivism, a well-established tradition in the philosophy of science, is often ignored. However, a study of strategy literature and research reveals that it is drawn upon more frequently than is explicitly acknowledged. Constructivism occupies a methodological space characterized by ontological realism and epistemological relativism. Ontological realism is an important cornerstone of a field as applied as strategy, while epistemological relativism helps us explore the constructed nature of the field, where the researcher is an active participant rather than a reactor or information processor. In this paper, we demonstrate the precedents and possibilities for constructivist research in strategic management. We examine some of the existent constructivist works in the strategy literature, and point to specific techniques, including historical analysis, to demonstrate how this perspective may advance the boundaries of strategy research.

The analysis shows that if tax deductions are taken on a cash basis, and if the underlying assets and liabilities are recorded at the present value of their associated future cash flows, then the value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is their recorded amount, regardless of when the asset will be realized or when the liability will reverse. If tax deductions are not taken when the expenditure is made (e.g., depreciation) or if underlying assets and liabilities are recorded at more than the present value of their associated future cash flows (e.g., warranty liabilities), then the market value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is less than their recorded values.

Managers are more likely to separately announce a prior\u2010period gain from the sale of property, plant, and equipment (PPE) than a loss. This strategy provides the lowest possible benchmark for evaluating current earnings, thereby allowing the manager to highlight the most favorable change in earnings. This strategic disclosure behavior is more likely to occur when it prevents a negative earnings surprise. The observed strategic disclosure decisions are consistent with a conjecture by managers that the nonrecurring nature of the prior\u2010period gain/loss will be forgotten unless it is separately announced. Consistent with this conjecture, there is some evidence that equity investors, one potential target of strategic reporting, use the benchmark that managers provide in earnings announcements to evaluate current earnings, even when the components of this benchmark have different persistence. However, cross\u2010sectional analyses provide no evidence that managers ex post exploit the equity mispricing that occurs between the earnings announcement date and the release of the financial statements.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/75/2/151/2576/Strategic-Benchmarks-in-Earnings-Announcements-The","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings announcements and managerial strategies without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2000","75","2","Laureen A.

In this setting, the manager's reporting bias reduces the value relevance of the manager's report; that is, it adds noise to the report. Through comparative static results, our model yields insights into factors that affect the slope and intercept terms in a regression of price on earnings. Specifically, we find that the information content of the manager's report, as captured by the earnings slope coefficient, falls as the private cost to the manager of biasing reports falls, and as the uncertainty about the manager's objective increases. We also find that the magnitude of the adjustment for the expected amount of bias, as captured by the absolute value of the intercept, falls as the uncertainty about the manager's objective increases. Finally, to highlight conditions under which managers would lobby to retain an option to bias reports (i.e., retain reporting flexibility), we analyze the effect of the option to bias on the manager's welfare. For example, we show that the ex ante benefit from biasing the report is positive if there is sufficient uncertainty about the manager's reporting objective.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/75/2/229/2574/Reporting-Bias","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['bias', 'reporting', 'manager']","The article discusses managerial reporting bias in a technical context without a significant focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.
