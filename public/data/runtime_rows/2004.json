Compared to regional constraints, connections among all geographic regions decreased clearly beneficial innovation diffusion (a low-threshold adoption model) but increased ambiguous innovation diffusion (a social influence model).

Technical contractors offer a unique opportunity for examining assumptions about organizations, work, and time because they are itinerant professionals who operate outside any single organizational context. We find that contractors do perceive themselves to have flexibility and that a few achieve a kind of flexibility unattained by most permanent employees doing similar work, but rather than take advantage of what they call \u201cbeach time\u201d and \u201cdowntime,\u201d the majority work long hours and rarely schedule their time flexibly.

Internal selection theorists view managers in multiproduct firms as the primary agents of evolutionary change because they decide whether individual products and technologies are retained or eliminated. In contrast, external selection theorists contend that the environment drives evolution because it determines whether entire firms live or die. Though these theories differ, they describe tightly interwoven processes. In assessing the coevolution of internal and external selection among personal computer manufacturers across a 20-year period, we found that (1) firms learned cumulatively and adaptively from internal and partial external selection, the latter occurring when the environment killed part but not all of a firm; (2) internal and partial external selection co- evolved, as each affected the other's future rate and the odds of firm failure; (3) partial external selection had a greater effect on future outcomes than internal selection; and (4) the lessons gleaned from prior selection were reflected in a firm's ability to develop new products, making that an important mediator between past and future selection events.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/4131455","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","[]","The article focuses primarily on evolutionary theories of firm-level learning without any explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In Study 2, all participants survived a layoff, but they varied in the extent to which they experienced the post-layoff environment as threatening to their well-being.

Study 1 showed that the negative impact of layoffs on survivors' organizational commitment was reduced when perceived control was relatively high. Study 2 showed that the tendency for survivors' job performance to be adversely affected by high threat to their well-being was reduced when perceived control was relatively high. In other words, perceived control was more strongly related to employees' organizational commitment in the presence than in the absence of layoffs and to survivors' job performance when they experienced the post-layoff environment as more threatening.

Given that people's network contacts often share their demographic attributes (i.e., the network is homophilous), the two approaches seem equivalent and the first seems preferable because it is easier to implement. In this paper, we demonstrate several important limits to this rationale. First, we argue and show, in an analysis of 1,518 project teams in a contract research and development firm, that even when internal organizational networks are significantly homophilous with respect to demographic variables, the very logic of the causal structure that underlies theories of demographic diversity carries ambiguous performance implications. This ambiguity is due to the fact that demographic diversity has opposing effects on two social network variables\u2014internal density and external range\u2014each of which has a positive effect on a team's performance. We also demonstrate that a focus on demographic criteria is problematic because the demographic makeup of an organization can place inherent limits on a manager's ability to shape the demographic composition of a team. The ambiguous performance implications and the inherent limits placed on a manager's ability to manage a team's demography reduce the likelihood that a manager's interventions will be successful.

In contrast, in firms with continued founding-family ownership and relatively few independent directors, firm performance is significantly worse than in non-family firms. We also find that a moderate family board presence provides substantial benefits to the firm. Additional tests suggest that families often seek to minimize the presence of independent directors, while outside shareholders seek independent director representation. These findings highlight the importance of independent directors in mitigating conflicts between shareholder groups and imply that the interests of minority investors are best protected when, through independent directors, they have power relative to family shareholders.

This has important implications for understanding both the acquisition process and, more broadly, corporate governance in successful firms. Using a multiple-case, inductive study of 12 technology-based ventures, we find that acquisition occurs when sellers are pushed toward acquisition by difficult, albeit natural strategic hurdles, such as a chief executive search or funding round, and by strong personal motivations for sale, such as past failures and investments by friends. Sellers are also more likely to be pulled toward acquisition by attractive buyers that offer synergistic combination potential and organizational rapport, factors usually associated with the long-term interests of buyers. We reframe acquisition as courtship and corporate governance as a syndicate, indicating joint decision making with some common goals, and explore the generalizability of these views for private versus public firms and other contingencies.

This combination of activities produced a constellation of salutary outputs: more time for the teams to do their work, team members with essential task-related competencies and sufficient time to contribute to their projects, and complete rather than partial performance strategies. In turn, the three salutary outputs formed a constellation of key inner resources that propelled the high-performing teams on a virtuous path of reinforcing activities and outputs that, despite difficulties, ultimately led to success, whereas the absence of one or more of these resources led the low-performing teams down a vacuous path of accumulating confusion and inactivity from which they never recovered.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/4131442","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['team development', 'performance', 'mobilization']","The article focuses primarily on project team performance and mobilization strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We specify this prediction in an explicit model of \u201cRed Queen\u201d competition, in which exposure to competition makes organizations both more viable and stronger competitors. We find support for our ideas in empirical estimates of the model obtained using data on hard disk drive manufacturers.

Such relationships are typically maintained through interpersonal interactions between customers and their providers. Lately, however, firms have been seeking to make their service operations more scalable by offering customers access to Internet-based, self-serve technology. This raises questions about the implications of inserting self-serve technology into embedded relationships. Recent research on the role of information technology (IT) within interfirm network relations suggests that relationships and the use of IT are complementary. However, most of this research focuses on the organizational level and fails to consider the instantiation of these interfirm relations by the actions and interactions of individual actors (e.g., customers and salespeople) representing their respective firms. In this paper, we explore the implications of using IT within interfirm relations through an analysis of customers\u2019 and sales representatives\u2019 (reps) work activities and interpersonal relationships. We apply a practice perspective that highlights how macrolevel phenomena such as interfirm relations are created and recreated through the microlevel actions taken by firm members. This analysis reveals that managing the complementarity between relationships and IT in practice is fraught with considerable tension. This study of WebGA, a bricks-and-clicks dotcom, highlights how the use of the self-serve technology made it more difficult for sales reps to build and maintain embedded relationships with their customers. The use of IT altered the nature and quality of information shared by the participants, undermined the ability of sales reps to provide consulting services to customers, reduced the frequency of their interaction, and prompted sales reps to expend social capital to promote customers\u2019 technology adoption. These changes produced intended and unintended shifts in the network relations enacted by WebGA and its customers, and raised serious challenges to the viability of WebGA\u2019s business model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1030.0016","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['relationships', 'interpersonal', 'technology', 'social capital']","The article discusses the implications of technology on interpersonal relationships and social capital within business contexts, indicating some awareness of relational dynamics.

System integration is performed only if a threshold fault count has been exceeded; otherwise, module development is allowed to continue. We derive an expression for calculating fault thresholds and analyze the policy to reveal the presence of three operating regions: (1) a region in which development should continue with no system integration, (2) a region in which system integration occurs if a threshold fault count has been exceeded, and (3) a region in which system integration should always take place. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate how the fault thresholds change with system complexity, team skill, development environment, and project schedule. We also show how learning that occurs during each round of system integration leads to less frequent integration in the future, and lower total construction effort. Simulation experiments reveal that the fault threshold policy can be applied even if several homogeneity assumptions in the model are relaxed, allowing for differences in the propensity among modules to accumulate faults and the effort needed to correct these faults. Finally, the fault threshold policy outperforms a fixed-release policy in which system integration occurs whenever a fixed number of modules has been released.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0012","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical project management policy related to software development without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Infomediaries offer matching services that facilitate establishment of a buyer-seller agreement, and value-added services that either provide a standalone benefit or enhance benefits from matching services. This paper develops and analyzes economic models of intermediaries to examine their pricing and product line design strategies. Intermediaries provide aggregation benefits: Buyers find an intermediary\u2019s service more valuable if it provides access to more sellers, and sellers value it more if it provides access to more buyers, but also when they compete with fewer sellers. Due to this unique combination of network effects, we find that an intermediary has stronger incentives to provide quality-differentiated versions of its service relative to other information goods sellers. When buyers have constant marginal valuations for service quality, the intermediary should offer only two levels of service. While it is optimal for the intermediary to offer two levels of service, increasing the quality of the low-level service reduces the intermediary\u2019s profits due to increased cannibalization of the premium service.

This paper integrates sociological and economic theories about institution-based trust to propose that the perceived effectiveness of three IT-enabled institutional mechanisms\u2013specifically feedback mechanisms, third-party escrow services, and credit card guarantees\u2013engender buyer trust in the community of online auction sellers. Trust in the marketplace intermediary that provides the overarching institutional context also builds buyer\u2019s trust in the community of sellers. In addition, buyers\u2019 trust in the community of sellers (as a group) facilitates online transactions by reducing perceived risk. Data collected from 274 buyers in Amazon\u2019s online auction marketplace provide support for the proposed structural model. Longitudinal data collected a year later show that transaction intentions are correlated with actual and self-reported buyer behavior. The study shows that the perceived effectiveness of institutional mechanisms encompasses both \u201cweak\u201d (market-driven) and \u201cstrong\u201d (legally binding) mechanisms. These mechanisms engender trust, not only in a few reputable sellers, but also in the entire community of sellers, which contributes to an effective online marketplace. The results thus help explain why, despite the inherent uncertainty that arises when buyers and sellers are separated in time and in space, online marketplaces are proliferating. Implications for theory are discussed, and suggestions for future research on improving IT-enabled trust-building mechanisms are suggested.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0015","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'institutional mechanisms', 'community']","The article discusses trust and institutional mechanisms in online marketplaces, but it primarily focuses on technical and economic aspects rather than social justice or equity themes.

The Effects of Flash on Information Search Performance and Perceptions","The proliferation of information on the Internet poses a significant challenge on humans\u2019 limited attentional resources. To attract online users\u2019 attention, various kinds of animation are widely used on websites. Despite the ubiquitous use of animation, there is an inadequate understanding of its effect on attention. Focusing on flash animation, this study examines its effects on online users\u2019 performance and perceptions in both task-relevant and task-irrelevant information search contexts by drawing on the visual search literature and two theories from cognitive psychology. In the task-relevant context, flash is applied on the search target; while in the task-irrelevant context, flash is applied on a nontarget item. The results of this study confirm that flash does attract users\u2019 attention and facilitates quicker location of the flashed target item in tightly packed screen displays. However, there is no evidence that attracting attention increases recall of the flashed item, as is generally presumed in practice, and may even decrease the overall recall. One explanation is that when users have to use their limited attentional resources on suppressing the distraction of flash, they will have less mental resources to process information. Moreover, the results suggest that processing information about an item depends not only on the attention it attracts per se, but also on the attention that other items on the same screen attract. While flashing an item may not increase the recall of that item, it can reduce the recall of other items (especially the nontarget items) on the screen. Finally, flash has negative effects on users\u2019 focused attention and attitude towards using the website. These results have implications for website interface design, online product promotion, online advertising, and multimedia training systems, among others.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0017","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online user attention and performance without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

To address these contradictions, we investigate a holistic, configurational approach with the prevailing universalistic or contingency perspectives in exploring the effects of IT outsourcing strategies on outsourcing success. Based on residual rights theory, we begin by identifying three dimensions of IT outsourcing strategies: degree of integration, allocation of control, and performance period. We then develop a model of fit-as-gestalt, drawing from literatures on strategy, governance, interorganizational relationships, and outsourcing. Next, based on data from 311 firms in South Korea, we test universalistic and contingency perspectives in explaining the relationship between IT outsourcing strategies and outsourcing success. We then identify three congruent patterns, or gestalts, of IT outsourcing strategies. We term these strategies independent, arm's-length, and embedded strategies. To establish the predictive validity of these gestalts and the viability of a configurational perspective, we then explore the effects of these congruent gestalts vis-\u00e0-vis noncongruent patterns on three dimensions of outsourcing success: strategic competence, cost efficiency, and technology catalysis. We also contrast the effects of each of the three gestalts on each of the three dimensions of outsourcing success.

However, there is little empirical research into the optimal design of these networks under real-world conditions. Early speculation about the behavior of P2P networks has focused on the role that positive network externalities play in improving performance as the network grows. However, negative network externalities also arise in P2P networks because of the consumption of scarce network resources or an increased propensity of users to free ride in larger networks, and the impact of these negative network externalities\u2014while potentially important\u2014has received far less attention. Our research addresses this gap in understanding by measuring the impact of both positive and negative network externalities on the optimal size of P2P networks. Our research uses a unique dataset collected from the six most popular OpenNap P2P networks between December 19, 2000, and April 22, 2001. We find that users contribute additional value to the network at a decreasing rate and impose costs on the network at an increasing rate, while the network increases in size. Our results also suggest that users are less likely to contribute resources to the network as the network size increases. Together, these results suggest that the optimal size of these centralized P2P networks is bounded\u2014At some point the costs that a marginal user imposes on the network will exceed the value they provide to the network. This finding is in contrast to early predictions that larger P2P networks would always provide more value to users than smaller networks. Finally, these results also highlight the importance of considering user incentives\u2014an important determinant of resource sharing in P2P networks\u2014in network design.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0020","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of peer-to-peer networks and their economic implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When uncertainty and irreversibility are high, concepts from real options should be used to properly structure the evaluation and management of investment opportunities, and thereby capture the value of managerial flexibility. However, while innovation researchers have posited that option value can influence the motivations of early adopters, and options researchers have identified emerging IT as a promising area for application of options valuation techniques, there has yet to be a systematic theoretical integration of work on IT innovation and real options. This paper seeks to fill this gap by developing a model of the determinants of option value associated with investments in innovative IT platforms. In so doing, the model addresses a central question in the innovation field: When should a firm take a lead role in innovation with emerging technologies? The analysis begins with an explanation of real options analysis and how it differs from conventional approaches for evaluating new technologies. Then a set of 12 factors\u2014drawn from 4 complementary perspectives on organizational innovation (technology strategy, organizational learning, innovation bandwagons, and technology adaptation)\u2014is synthesized into a model of the option value of IT platform investments. Rationales are provided to explain the direct effects of these factors on option value, and selected interactions among the factors are also considered. Finally, the implications of the model are presented in three areas: predicting IT platform initiation and adoption, valuing IT platform options, and managing IT platform implementation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0021","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['innovation', 'investment', 'technology']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of investment in IT platforms and the evaluation of option value, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study investigates the impact of environmental uncertainty and task characteristics on user satisfaction with data by using IS and organizational theories. Responses were matched from 77 CEOs and 166 senior managers, who were end users of IS. The partial least squares technique indicated that environmental uncertainty has a positive impact on task characteristics. Task characteristics have a direct and mediating impact on user satisfaction with data. Our findings also demonstrated that user satisfaction with data could be better understood by overlapping IS and organizational theories, rather than by treating the subject matter in disjoint fields.

We focus on identifying whether and how DSSs influence the decision process (e.g., cognitive effort deployed, discussion quality, and decision alternatives considered) and, as a result, how these DSSs influence decision outcomes (e.g., profit and satisfaction both with the decision process and the outcome). We study two specific marketing resource allocation decisions in a laboratory context: sales effort allocation and customer targeting. We find that decision makers who use high-quality, model-based DSSs make objectively better decisions than do decision makers who only have access to a generic decision tool (Microsoft Excel). However, their subjective evaluations (perceptions) of both their decisions and the processes that lead to those decisions do not necessarily improve as a result of DSS use. And expert judges, serving as surrogates for top management, have a difficult time assessing the objective quality of those decisions. Our results suggest that what managers get from a high-quality DSS may be substantially better than what they see. To increase the inclination for managerial adoption and use of DSS, we must get users to \u201csee\u201d the benefits of using a DSS. Our results also suggest two ways to bridge the perception-reality gap: (1) improve the perceived value of the decision process by designing DSSs both to encourage discussion (e.g., by providing explanation and support for alternative recommendations) as well as to reduce the perceived complexity of the problem so that managers invest more cognitive effort in exploring additional options and (2) provide feedback on the likely market/business outcomes of various decision options.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0026","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['decision support systems', 'managerial decision making', 'resource allocation']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of decision support systems and their impact on marketing resource allocation, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Many studies unquestionably assume that trust is intrinsically beneficial, and dismiss the possibility that the effects of trust may be dependent on the situation (or conditions) at present. This paper theoretically and empirically examines outcomes of an individual's trust in global virtual teams under differing situations (or conditions). In Study 1, we find that early in a team's existence, a member's trusting beliefs have a direct positive effect on his or her trust in the team and perceptions of team cohesiveness. Later on, however, a member's trust in his team operates as a moderator, indirectly affecting the relationships between team communication and perceptual outcomes. Study 2 similarly suggests that trust effects are sensitive to the particular situation or condition. Combined, the studies find that trust affects virtual teams differently in different situations. Future studies on trust will need to consider situational contingencies. This paper contributes to the literature on IT-enabled relationships by theorizing and empirically testing how trust affects attitudes and behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0028","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'virtual teams', 'situational contingencies']","The article discusses trust in global virtual teams and emphasizes the importance of situational factors, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing monopolist invests in IT (modeled as changes in parametric characteristics of the firm) to design a better-quality product and charge a higher price. While this profit-maximizing adjustment generates more consumer surplus, it also increases production costs in a way that adversely affects productivity. In contrast, a simple model extension shows that when a firm is unwilling or unable to improve product quality, then IT investments result in suboptimal improvements in profits, an increase in consumer surplus, and an increase in productivity. Together, these models highlight the way in which product quality moderates the relationship between IT investments and economic performance. We also demonstrate that these relationships are robust to the socially optimal case in which a social planner chooses price and quality to maximize social welfare. In addition, we demonstrate that the results of the monopoly model hold when considering the design and development of products offered free of charge (e.g., free online content), but that provide indirect benefits to the firm (e.g., more advertising revenues).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0029","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['social welfare', 'consumer surplus', 'economic performance']","The article discusses the impact of IT investments on product quality and economic performance, with a mention of maximizing social welfare.

It is shown that a monopolist's optimal pricing schedule can be characterized as a simple combination of the zero-piracy pricing schedule and a piracy-indifferent pricing schedule that makes all customers indifferent between legal usage and piracy. An increase in the quality of pirated goods, while lowering prices and profits, increases total surplus by expanding both the fraction of legal users and the volume of legal usage. In the absence of price discrimination, a seller's optimal level of technology-based protection against piracy is shown to be at the technologically maximal level, which maximizes the difference between the quality of the legal and pirated goods. However, when a seller can price discriminate, its optimal choice is always a strictly lower level of technology-based protection. These results are based on the following digital rights conjecture: that granting digital rights increases the incidence of digital piracy, and that managing digital rights therefore involves restricting the rights of usage that contribute to customer value. Moreover, if a digital rights management system weakens over time due to the underlying technology being progressively hacked, a seller's optimal strategic response may involve either increasing or decreasing its level of technology-based protection. This direction of change is related to whether the DRM technology implementing each marginal reduction in piracy is increasingly less or more vulnerable to hacking. Pricing and technology choice guidelines are presented, and some welfare implications are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0030","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['digital rights management', 'piracy', 'welfare implications']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of pricing and digital rights management in the context of digital piracy, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions\u2014namely, collection, control, and awareness\u2014exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0032","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'social contract theory', 'consumer confidence', 'behavioral intention']","The article addresses consumer privacy concerns and incorporates social contract theory, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in the context of information systems.

However, there are few published studies on the ongoing relationships, and most of these adopt a customer perspective, de-emphasizing suppliers. In this study, we look at both customer and supplier perspectives, by means of the psychological contract of customer and supplier project managers. We apply the concept of psychological contract to perceived mutual obligations, and to how such fulfillment of obligations can predict success. Our research questions are (1) What are the critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship? and (2) What is the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success? We use a sequential, qualitative-quantitative approach to develop and test our model. In the qualitative study, we probe the nature of customer-supplier obligations using in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview transcripts show that both customers and suppliers identify six obligations that are critical to success. Customers perceive supplier obligations to be accurate project scoping, clear authority structures, taking charge, effective human capital management, effective knowledge transfer, and effective interorganizational teams. Suppliers perceive customer obligations as clear specifications, prompt payment, close project monitoring, dedicated project staffing, knowledge sharing, and project ownership. In the second quantitative study, we assess the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success through a field study of 370 managers. Results show that fulfilled obligations predict success over and above the effects of contract type, duration, and size.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0035","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['obligations', 'customer-supplier', 'relationships']","The article discusses customer-supplier relationships and mutual obligations, which hints at a consideration of ethical interactions in business.

These systems are designed to meet the requirements of a diverse set of stakeholders with different business needs, priorities, and objectives. One managerial tool for addressing and reconciling such differences is control, which encompasses all attempts to motivate individuals to act in a manner that is consistent with organizational objectives. This paper examines two research questions. How do stakeholders exercise control during different phases of large IS projects? Why do control choices change across project phases? Results of two case studies suggest control is exercised differently for each phase. During the initial phase of a project, control is exercised as \u201ccollective sensemaking,\u201d in which both IS and business stakeholders utilize mostly informal mechanisms of control. During development, \u201ctechnical winnowing\u201d of mechanisms occurs such that control is vested primarily in IS managers, who structure hierarchical relationships with subordinates and who rely extensively on formal control mechanisms. Both IS and business stakeholders employ formal and informal mechanisms during implementation to exercise control as \u201ccollaborative coordinating.\u201d The results also suggest that changes in control choices from one project phase to another are triggered by factors in the project, stakeholder, and global contexts. As factors change across phases, so too do control choices. Further, problems that surface in one project phase trigger changes to controls in subsequent phases. These findings are integrated into a model of the dynamics of control. Implications of these results are drawn, and directions for future research are suggested.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0036","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['diverse', 'stakeholders', 'control', 'collaborative']","The article discusses the needs of a 'diverse set of stakeholders' and emphasizes 'collaborative coordinating' in the context of control mechanisms, indicating a moderate focus on inclusivity and stakeholder engagement.

These attributions potentially aid investors in the interpretation of management forecasts by confirming known relationships between attributions and profitability or by identifying additional causes that investors should consider when forecasting earnings. We investigate why managers choose to provide attributions with their forecasts and whether the attributions are related to security price reactions to management earnings forecasts. Using a sample of 951 management earnings forecasts issued from 1993 to 1996, we find that attributions are more likely for larger firms, less likely for firms in regulated industries, less likely for forecasts issued over longer horizons, more likely for bad news forecasts, and more likely for forecasts that are maximum type. Furthermore, attributions are associated with greater absolute price reactions to management forecasts, more negative price reactions to management forecasts (forecast news held constant), and a greater price reaction per dollar of unexpected earnings. Our findings hold after control for the aforementioned determinants of attributions and after control for other firm- and forecast-specific variables that are often associated with security prices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00127.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings forecasts and their relationship to profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

We study a firm that hires an accountant to produce a report that reveals information to investors regarding the returns to the firm's past investments. In constructing the report, the accountant must combine information elicited from the firm's manager with other information directly observable to the accountant. The manager's information is assumed to be directly observable only by the manager and to be of superior quality to the other information available to the accountant. Reliability-relevance trade-offs arise because as the accountant places more weight on the manager's report, potentially more useful information gets included in the report, at the cost of encouraging the manager to distort his or her information to a greater extent. Capital market participants anticipate this behavior and price the firm accordingly. We show how the market's price response to the release of the firm's aggregate report, the efficiency of the firm's investment decisions, and the manager's incentives to manipulate the soft information under his or her control are all affected by\u2014and affect\u2014the aggregation procedure the accountant adopts. In addition, we identify a broad range of circumstances under which aggregated reports are strictly more efficient than disaggregated reports because aggregation tempers the manager's misreporting incentives. We also demonstrate that, as any given component of the aggregated accounting report becomes softer, the equilibrium level of the firm's investment diminishes and the market places greater weight on the remaining components of the report.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00129.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that the information extracted from accounting reports of investments and earnings is different when intangibles are measured and identified separately from operating expenses than when intangibles are left commingled with operating expenses. This difference in the market's information causes a change in the behavior of market prices, inducing changes in the firm's investments and cash flows. Thus, from a real effects perspective, measuring intangibles is not unambiguously desirable. We identify the conditions under which providing information on intangibles may be desirable. This study also shows the inadequacy of statistical associations between accounting numbers and prices as a basis for evaluating the desirability of measuring intangible investments.

We conceptualize corporate transparency within a country as output from a multifaceted system whose components collectively produce, gather, validate, and disseminate information.

The first factor, interpreted as financial transparency, captures the intensity and timeliness of financial disclosures, and their interpretation and dissemination by analysts and the media. The second factor, interpreted as governance transparency, captures the intensity of governance disclosures used by outside investors to hold officers and directors accountable. We investigate whether these factors vary with countries' legal/judicial regimes and political economies.

The purpose of this study is to test this assertion by investigating whether these measures of investor protection are associated with an important role of good corporate governance: identifying and terminating poorly performing CEOs. Our tests indicate that strong law enforcement institutions significantly improve the association between CEO turnover and poor performance, whereas extensive investor protection laws do not. In addition, we find that in countries with strong law enforcement, CEO turnover is more likely to be associated with poor stock returns when stock prices are more informative. Finding that strong law enforcement institutions are associated with improved CEO turnover-performance sensitivity is consistent with good corporate governance requiring law enforcement institutions capable of protecting shareholders' property rights (i.e., protecting shareholders from expropriation by insiders). Finding that investor \u00a0protection laws are not associated with improved CEO turnover-performance sensitivity is open to several explanations. For example, investor protection laws may not be as important as strong law enforcement in fostering good governance, the set of laws we examine may not be the set that are most important in promoting good governance, or measurement error in our surrogate for extensive investor protection laws may reduce the power of our test of this variable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00138.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['investor protection', 'corporate governance', 'law enforcement']","The article focuses primarily on investor protection and corporate governance without significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Additionally, we find the relative size of ownership retained by pre-IPO owners to be negatively related to the extent of disclosure, as predicted by signaling models.

Option pay-to-performance sensitivities become weaker as options fall underwater, often leading to pressures to reprice options or restore pay-to-performance sensitivity in other ways. Building a detailed data set on executives' portfolios of stock and options, we find that the responsiveness of pay-to-performance sensitivities (created by all executive holdings of stock and options) to changes in stock price is large. The elasticity of pay-to-performance sensitivities with respect to stock price decreases is about 0.7 and is larger for high-option executives and for executives with high percentages of options already underwater. The dominant mechanism through which companies offset declines in option pay-to-performance sensitivities is larger option grants following stock price declines; on average, these larger grants restore approximately 40% of the stock-price-induced pay-to-performance sensitivity declines. Option repricings are inconsequential in this regard, despite the attention they have attracted. In looking at positive returns, we find the reverse: higher returns both directly increase pay-to-performance sensitivities and lead to larger option grants, which raise pay-to-performance sensitivities further. Thus, option grants to executives tend to be largest following large stock price increases or large stock price decreases.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00142.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of executive compensation without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

The tests use a unique, comprehensive data set for firm-level control and ownership structures from 9 East Asian and 13 Western European countries. Univariate regressions show that income management that is induced by the wedge between control rights and cash flow rights is significantly limited in countries with high statutory protection of minority rights (proxied by legal tradition, minority rights protection, the efficiency of the judicial system, or disclosure standards) and effective extra-legal institutions (proxied by the effectiveness of competition laws, diffusion of the press, and tax compliance). Furthermore, multiple regression results show that a common law tradition and an efficient judicial system subsume the effects of the other legal institutions, and that a high rate of tax compliance subsumes the effects of the other extra-legal institutions in curbing insider income management. It is surprising that a high rate of tax compliance ultimately has a greater effect than legal tradition and the efficiency of the judicial system. Although this finding is unexpected, given prior evidence on the dominant roles of legal institutions in macroeconomic issues and corporate policies, it is consistent with the recent argument that effective tax enforcement is like a public good in that it can reduce insiders' private control benefits. An implication of this finding is that closer attention to extra-legal institutions has the potential to enhance our understanding of the institutional reforms needed to limit insider private control benefits.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00144.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['minority rights', 'legal institutions', 'tax compliance']","The article discusses the role of legal and extra-legal institutions in protecting minority rights and limiting income management, indicating some awareness of social equity issues.

Our analysis uses the Transparency and Disclosure scores developed recently by Standard & Poor's. These scores rate the disclosure of companies from around the world using U.S. disclosure practices as an implicit benchmark. Results show a positive association between these disclosure scores and a variety of market interaction measures, including U.S. listing, U.S. investment flows, exports to, and operations in the United States. Trade with the United States at the country level, however, has an insignificant relationship with the disclosure scores. Our empirical analysis controls for the previously documented association between disclosure and firm size, performance, and country legal origin. Our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that cross-border economic interactions are associated with similarities in disclosure and governance practices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00146.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of disclosure practices and their association with market interactions, lacking any reference to social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

A Variance Decomposition Analysis","This paper extends the variance decomposition framework of Campbell [1991], Campbell and Ammer [1993], and Vuolteenaho [2002] to address the relative value relevance of accrual news, cash flow news, and expected-return news in driving firm-level equity returns. The extension is based on the Feltham-Ohlson [1995, 1996] clean surplus relations. Using three models, this study shows that all three factors, accruals, cash flows, and expected future discount rates are value relevant. Moreover, accrual news is found to significantly dominate expected-return news in driving firm-level stock returns. Operating income news is also found to significantly dominate both expected-return news and free cash flow news in driving firm-level stock returns. Furthermore, after splitting net income into cash flow and accrual earnings components in the Vuolteenaho model, accrual earnings news and cash flow earnings news are found to equally drive firm-level stock returns and to dominate expected-return news. Further disaggregation of the data yields some evidence that accrual earnings news is a more important factor than cash flow earnings news in driving current stock returns. Overall, the three models indicate that changes in expected future accruals are a primary driver, if not the primary driver, of current stock returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.t01-1-00140.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on financial metrics and technical analysis related to stock returns without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We find that analysts are less likely to follow firms with potential incentives to withhold or manipulate information, such as when the family/management group is the largest control rights blockholder. Furthermore, this relation is stronger for firms from low-shareholder-protection countries. Using valuation regressions that take into account potential endogeneity between analyst following and firm value, we find a positive valuation effect when analysts cover firms that have both potentially poor internal governance and weak country-level external governance. Overall, our findings suggest that corporate governance plays an important role in analysts' willingness to follow firms and that increased analyst following is associated with higher valuations, particularly for firms likely to face governance problems.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.t01-1-00142.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['investor protection', 'governance', 'analyst following']","The article discusses investor protection and corporate governance, which touch on ethical considerations in accounting practices.

Using our pooled sample, we find that the ratio of non-audit fees to total fees has a positive relation with the absolute value of accruals similar to Frankel, Johnson, and Nelson [2002]. However, using latent class mixture models to identify clusters of firms with a homogenous regression structure reveals that this positive association only occurs for about 8.5% of the sample. In contrast to the fee ratio results, we find consistent evidence of a negative relation between the level of fees (both audit and non-audit) paid to auditors and accruals (i.e., higher fees are associated with smaller accruals). The latent class analysis also indicates that this negative relation is strongest for client firms with weak governance. Overall, our results are most consistent with auditor behavior being constrained by the reputation effects associated with allowing clients to engage in unusual accrual choices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.t01-1-00143.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit fees and corporate governance without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our results support several key new inferences regarding audit firm portfolio management decisions. First, the results show that this firm is shedding the riskier clients in its portfolio, consistent with the risk avoidance theory of audit firm portfolio management. Second, the results show that the firm's newly accepted clients are less risky than its continuing clients. Although results of both the client continuance and client acceptance decisions imply a less risky portfolio emerging over time, there are greater differences in risk between continuing and discontinued clients than between continuing and newly accepted clients. Third, we find that audit risk factors are more important in audit firm portfolio management decisions than are financial risk factors. Finally, we find no evidence that audit pricing affects the client acceptance and continuance decisions of this firm, controlling for risk and other client characteristics.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00153.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit firm portfolio management and risk avoidance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We also examine an alternative proxy for disclosure quality that captures the degree of segment disaggregation and document a positive association between this measure and excess value. Our results are robust to controls for firm performance and information environment.

For example, inflation creates an earnings illusion as an artifact of the mismatching of expenses based on allocations of historical costs with current revenues in determining earnings. This mismatching distorts mappings of aggregate earnings and book values into equity value such that value-relevant information is lost. In this article we consider the consequences of inflation and foreign exchange accounting policies, including those contained in accounting standards, on the value relevance of bottom-line accounting numbers. Policies are identified that achieve efficient accounting in the sense that aggregate (comprehensive) earnings and book values are sufficient for an accounting representation of equity value. The linear relations that emerge provide predictions on capitalization coefficients that help explain results of empirical inquiries. As well, our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for policies contained in accounting standards that contributes to the resolution of controversies such as that concerning foreign exchange accounting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00155.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to inflation and foreign exchange without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We predict that U.S. investors exhibit home bias in their preference for accounting methods conforming to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) because such methods are more familiar, reduce information processing costs, and are perceived as higher quality. We find that firms exhibiting higher levels (changes) of U.S. GAAP conformity have greater levels (changes) of U.S. institutional ownership. Lead-lag regressions suggest that increases in U.S. GAAP conformity precede increases in U.S. investment, but changes in U.S. institutional holdings do not precede changes in accounting methods. We also find that the positive relation between U.S. GAAP conformity and U.S. investment holds regardless of a firm's visibility to U.S. investors (e.g., American Depositary Receipt listing, stock index membership, analyst following, firm size). However, we find that U.S. GAAP conformity has a significantly greater impact among firms already visible to U.S. investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2004.00157.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting choices and investment behaviors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Specifically, information that is mainly useful for predicting future events and of little use for evaluating past actions should only be made available to the public through management's self-interested disclosures.

These two hypotheses predict that an effective repetition strategy should encourage incidental processing during one presentation of the material and intentional processing during the other presentation of the material, but the hypotheses differ about the optimal order of these two types of processing.

Smart agents screen through a universe of alternatives, recommending only a handful well-matched to the customer's quality preferences. In this research, we ask and answer the following questions: In markets in which price and quality are uncorrelated, will the use of screening agents increase or decrease prices paid compared to searching from an unordered list of options? Will increasing the size of the store's underlying assortment increase or decrease prices paid when options have been screened on quality? In markets where higher priced goods have higher quality, will the use of screening agents increase or decrease prices paid and quality selected? Experiments 1 and 2 test the effect of quality screening when price and quality are uncorrelated. We then present an analytic model for markets in which price and quality are correlated. We deduce that ordering can cause price and quality to increase or decrease depending on the slope of the price-quality relationship in comparison with the relative importance of price in the utility function. We find support for this model in experiment 3.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/1/56/1801769","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of consumer behavior and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The Case of the Material Values ScaleGet access","Most measures of consumer behavior have been developed and employed in the United States. Thus, relatively little is known about the cross-cultural applicability of these measures. Using Richins and Dawson's (1992) Material Values Scale (MVS) as an exemplar, this article focuses on the problems researchers are likely to encounter when employing domestic mixed-worded scales (i.e., scales that contain both positive- and reverse-worded items) in cross-cultural applications. Through an initial study among over 800 adults from the United States, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, and Korea, we show that the cross-cultural measurement equivalence and construct validity of the MVS is challenged by its mixed-worded Likert format. Through a second study among approximately 400 Americans and East Asians, we find that other mixed-worded scales produce similar problems and that the cross-cultural applicability of such scales may be enhanced by replacing items posed as statements with items framed as questions.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/1/72/1801777","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['cross-cultural', 'consumer behavior', 'validity', 'measurement']","The article discusses cross-cultural applicability and measurement validity in consumer research, indicating an awareness of diversity in consumer behavior.

To understand the effects of time constraints (time pressure), a conceptual framework incorporating both the motivational and the resource effects of time constraints on consumers' information processing is developed. Using price as the attribute information to be evaluated, specific hypotheses about the effects of time constraints on the relationship between price and consumers' perceptions of quality and monetary sacrifice are proposed. The results of a replicated experiment show that perceptions of quality and monetary sacrifice exhibit different response patterns depending on the time constraints, price levels, and subjects' motivations to process information.

However, what is most effective for creating favorable product attitudes is not necessarily most effective in raising purchase intentions. This is because imagery processing should play a more prominent role in affecting purchase intentions because, when estimating their own behavior, people likely run a mental simulation of themselves performing that behavior.

In these situations, the contents of a consideration set depend on a combination of two motives. First, consumers prefer to create a consideration set of easy-to-compare alternatives. It is easier to compare alternatives that have alignable attributes or alternatives that have overlapping features. Second, consumers prefer to create consideration sets that have a high likelihood of containing their optimal alternative. For example, when the set of available alternatives requires the consumer to make trade-offs between benefits (i.e., to be compensatory), the consumer often delays making a decision about which benefits are preferable, and the consideration set tends to contain a more diverse set of alternatives. We document several factors that influence the relative importance of one or the other motive in consideration set formation and discuss implications for brand managers.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/2/244/1831669","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['diverse', 'consideration set', 'alternatives']","The article discusses the formation of consideration sets that include a 'more diverse set of alternatives,' indicating a moderate awareness of diversity in consumer choices.

We examine the links between embodiment, movement, and multisensory experience insofar as they help to elucidate the contours of art appreciation in a museum. We argue that embodiment can be identified at two levels: the phenomenological and the cognitive unconscious. At the first level, individuals are conscious of their feelings and actions while, at the second level, sensorimotor and other bodily oriented inference mechanisms inform their processes of abstract thought and reasoning. We analyze the consumption stories of 30 museum goers in order to understand how people move through museum spaces and feel, touch, hear, smell, and taste art. Further, through an analysis of metaphors and the use of conceptual blending, we tap into the participants' unconscious minds, gleaning important embodiment processes that shape their reasoning.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/2/259/1831677","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['embodiment', 'experience', 'aesthetic']","The article discusses the concept of embodiment and sensory experiences related to art appreciation, which touches on themes of individual experience and perception.

We combine these household panel purchase data with consumer questionnaire data, retail scanner data, data on advertising expenditure, and expert ratings. We find support for most hypotheses.

Specifically, the issues of interest include why consumers create personal Web sites, what consumers want to communicate, what strategies they devise to achieve their goal of self-presentation, and how those Web space strategies compare to the self-presentation strategies of real life (RL). The data reveal insights into the strategies behind constructing a digital self, projecting a digital likeness, digitally associating as a new form of possession, and reorganizing linear narrative structures.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/3/385/1790595","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-presentation', 'identity', 'digital', 'consumer']","The article discusses consumer identity construction in digital spaces, which touches on themes of self-presentation and identity.

The information cost structure is conceptualized as a trade-off of initial setup costs and ongoing usage costs. Lock-in is defined as consumers' decreased propensity to search and switch after an initial investment, which is determined both by a preference to minimize immediate costs and by an inability to anticipate the impact of future switching costs. The results of three experiments support the proposed mechanism. Experiment 1 shows that a small initial investment is sufficient to produce lock-in. Experiment 2 shows that the results of a prior investment on lock-in are not due to psychological commitment but to a shift in relative costs of incumbent and new options.

Moreover, consumers' estimated time and distance judgments showed inflated correlations regardless of underlying actual correlations, which may approach zero in urban environments.

A spreading activation network model of memory is used to predict the results of an experiment where the usage situations were varied at encoding and repeated recall sessions. The results of the study indicate that lower knowledge consumers tend to learn only the brand information that is appropriate for a usage situation at encoding and do not organize brands by subcategory in memory. Consequently, lower knowledge consumers tend to retrieve the same set of brands regardless of the usage situation at retrieval. Alternatively, higher knowledge consumers learn brand information appropriate for different usage situations and organize this information by product subcategories. This allows higher knowledge consumers to retrieve the brands appropriate for the usage situation at retrieval, and to vary the set of retrieved brands as the usage situation changes.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/30/3/443/1790632","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and brand information retrieval without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The degree of adverse selection and hence the liquidity of these assets is determined endogenously by the amount of trade for reasons other than private information. I find that higher productivity leads to increased liquidity. Moreover, liquidity magnifies the effects of changes in productivity on investment and volume. High productivity implies that investors initiate larger scale risky projects which increases the riskiness of their incomes. Riskier incomes induce more sales of claims to high-quality projects, causing liquidity to increase.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00625.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of liquidity and adverse selection in financial markets without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

We find considerable support for the existence of price pressure around mergers caused by uninformed shifts in excess demand, but that these effects are short-lived, consistent with the notion that short-run demand curves for stocks are not perfectly elastic. We estimate that nearly half of the negative announcement period stock price reaction for acquirers in stock-financed mergers reflects downward price pressure caused by merger arbitrage short selling, suggesting that previous estimates of merger wealth effects are biased downward.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00626.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading behavior and price pressure related to mergers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with a coinsurance effect, below investment grade target bonds earn significantly positive announcement period returns. By contrast, acquiring firm bonds earn negative announcement period returns. Additionally, target bonds have significantly larger returns when the target's rating is below the acquirer's, when the combination is anticipated to decrease target risk or leverage, and when the target's maturity is shorter than the acquirer's. Finally, we find that target and acquirer announcement period bond returns are significantly larger in the 1990s.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00628.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis related to mergers and acquisitions without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

I first develop a test to detect jump-induced misspecification and, using Treasury bill rates, find evidence for the presence of jumps. Second, I specify and estimate a nonparametric jump-diffusion model. Results indicate that jumps play an important statistical role. Estimates of jump times and sizes indicate that unexpected news about the macroeconomy generates the jumps. Finally, I investigate the pricing implications of jumps. Jumps generally have a minor impact on yields, but they are important for pricing interest rate options.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6321.2004.00632.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial models without addressing any social or ethical themes.

New Evidence from the Business Information Tracking Series","I use the Business Information Tracking Series (BITS), a new census database that covers the whole U.S. economy at the establishment level, to examine whether the finding of a diversification discount is an artifact of segment data. BITS data allow me to construct business units that are more consistently and objectively defined than segments, and thus more comparable across firms. Using these data on a sample that yields a discount according to segment data, I find a diversification premium. The premium is robust to variations in the sample, business unit definition, and measures of excess value and diversification.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00640.x","original articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of diversification in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2004","59","2","Joao Gomes,\u00a0\n                     Joao GomesSearch for more papers by this authorDmitry Livdan,\u00a0\n                     Dmitry Livdan\n                     The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and Bauer College of Business, University of Houston.

Further, consistent with the free cash-flow hypothesis, we find that the market reaction to share repurchase announcements is more positive among those firms that are more likely to overinvest.

There is less than 1/20 as many trades per unit time after hours as during the trading day. The reduced trading activity results in substantially higher trading costs: quoted and effective spreads are three to four times larger than during the trading day. The higher spreads reflect greater adverse selection and order persistence, but not higher dealer profits. Because liquidity provision remains competitive after hours, the greater adverse selection and higher trading costs provide a direct measure of the magnitude of the liquidity externalities generated during the trading day.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00646.x","original articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and liquidity without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The conditional variance of returns is a combination of jumps and smoothly changing components. A heterogeneous Poisson process with a time-varying conditional intensity parameter governs the likelihood of jumps. Unlike typical jump models with stochastic volatility, previous realizations of both jump and normal innovations can feed back asymmetrically into expected volatility. This model improves forecasts of volatility, particularly after large changes in stock returns. We provide empirical evidence of the impact and feedback effects of jump versus normal return innovations, leverage effects, and the time-series dynamics of jump clustering.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00648.x","original articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of stock return dynamics without any reference to socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

In bullish markets, institutional purchases have a bigger price impact than sells; however, in the bearish markets, sells have a higher price impact. This differs from previous findings on price impact asymmetry.

Here, the Monty Hall problem is used to detect probability judgment errors both in a cohort of individuals and in a market setting. When all subjects in a cohort made probability judgment errors, market prices also reflected the error. However, competition among two bias-free subjects was sufficient to drive prices to error-free levels. Thus, heterogeneity in behavior can be an important factor in asset pricing, and further, it may take few bias-free traders to make asset prices bias-free.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00654.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on experimental analysis of judgment errors in market settings without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We show a strong preference for holding taxable bonds in the tax-deferred account and equity in the taxable account, reflecting the higher tax burden on taxable bonds relative to equity. For most investors, the optimal asset location policy is robust to the introduction of tax-exempt bonds and liquidity shocks. Numerical results illustrate optimal portfolio decisions as a function of age and tax-deferred wealth. Interestingly, the proportion of total wealth allocated to equity is inversely related to the fraction of total wealth in tax-deferred accounts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00655.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset allocation and investment strategies without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Intraday data are used to estimate alternative measures of proportional and non-proportional (price impact) trading costs. The price impact models imply that abnormal returns to portfolio strategies decline with portfolio size. We calculate break-even fund sizes that lead to zero abnormal returns. In addition to equal- and value-weighted momentum strategies, we derive a liquidity-weighted strategy designed to reduce the cost of trades. Equal-weighted strategies perform the best before trading costs and the worst after trading costs. Liquidity-weighted and hybrid liquidity/value-weighted strategies have the largest break-even fund sizes: $5 billion or more (relative to December 1999 market capitalization) may be invested in these momentum strategies before the apparent profit opportunities vanish.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00656.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of trading strategies and market frictions without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpayers. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00658.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on investor demand and dividend payment strategies without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion, which are necessary for a higher woke score."],["2004","59","3","Mark A.

The informational role of trading is greater after announcements with a larger initial price impact, and the relation is associated with the surprise component of the announcement and the precision of the public information.

These dynamics, for which we provide empirical support, in conjunction with Epstein and Zin's (1989) preferences, can explain key asset markets phenomena. In our economy, financial markets dislike economic uncertainty and better long-run growth prospects raise equity prices. The model can justify the equity premium, the risk-free rate, and the volatility of the market return, risk-free rate, and the price\u2013dividend ratio. As in the data, dividend yields predict returns and the volatility of returns is time-varying.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00670.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and economic uncertainty without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The time period spanned allows a broader study not only of the disciplinary role of the takeover market in general, but also of the interaction between the takeover market and alternative governance mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the view of the corporate takeover market as a \u201ccourt of last resort,\u201d that is, it is an external source of discipline that intercedes when internal control mechanisms are relatively weak or ineffective.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00671.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of corporate takeovers and their disciplinary role in governance without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We show that differences in the composition of information between public and private information affect the cost of capital, with investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private information. This higher return arises because informed investors are better able to shift their portfolio to incorporate new information, and uninformed investors are thus disadvantaged. In equilibrium, the quantity and quality of information affect asset prices. We show firms can influence their cost of capital by choosing features like accounting treatments, analyst coverage, and market microstructure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00672.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the role of information in determining a firm's cost of capital, without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations."],["2004","59","4","John R.

In addition, repricing dates tend to either precede the release of good news or follow the release of bad news in the quarterly earnings announcements.

The relationship then follows from a general options-pricing result: For a levered firm, expected returns should always decrease with the level of idiosyncratic asset risk.

A proportional hazards model shows that there are observable shareholder characteristics that enable the fund to predict reliably on the day each account is opened whether the account will be short term or long term. Simulations show that the liquidity costs imposed on the fund by the expected short-term shareholders are significantly greater than those imposed by the expected long-term shareholders. Combining these results, the analysis argues that mutual funds do not provide equitable liquidity-risk insurance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00689.x","original articles","JF","Finance","3","['equitable', 'liquidity-risk', 'shareholders']","The article discusses the concept of 'equitable liquidity-risk insurance,' indicating a moderate awareness of fairness in financial practices.

The findings show that hybrid underwriting issues are more challenging to float. Compared to pure investment bank syndicates, hybrid syndicates serve clients that are smaller, have lower common stock rankings and less prior access to the capital markets, rely more on bank loans, and invest less capital but issue larger amounts, which indicates that commercial banks' participation enhances hybrid services.

Ten percent higher local tax rates are associated with 2.8% higher debt/asset ratios, with internal borrowing being particularly sensitive to taxes. Multinational affiliates are financed with less external debt in countries with underdeveloped capital markets or weak creditor rights, reflecting significantly higher local borrowing costs. Instrumental variable analysis indicates that greater borrowing from parent companies substitutes for three-quarters of reduced external borrowing induced by capital market conditions. Multinational firms appear to employ internal capital markets opportunistically to overcome imperfections in external capital markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00706.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital structure and internal capital markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a model to consistently value cashflows with changing risk-free rates, predictable risk premiums, and conditional betas in the context of a conditional CAPM. Practical valuation is accomplished with an analytic term structure of discount rates, with different discount rates applied to expected cashflows at different horizons. Using constant discount rates can produce large misvaluations, which, in portfolio data, are mostly driven at short horizons by market risk premiums and at long horizons by time variation in risk-free rates and factor loadings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00715.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling and valuation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that underpricing is, in part, compensation for expected post-IPO analyst coverage from highly ranked analysts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00719.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO underpricing and analyst coverage without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, making it purely profit-focused."],["2004","59","6","CAROLA SCHENONE,\u00a0\n                     CAROLA SCHENONE\n                     Schenone is with the Finance Department, University of Minnesota.

Using a new and unique data set, which compares the firm's pre-IPO banking relationships to the underwriters managing the firm's new issue, I test whether banking relationships established before the firm's IPO ameliorate asymmetric informa tion problems behind high IPO underpricing. The results show that firms with a pre-IPO banking relationship with a prospective underwriter face about 17% lower underpricing than firms without such banking relationships. These results are robust to controlling for the firm's endogenous selection of the pre-IPO banking institution.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00720.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of banking relationships and IPO underpricing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Thus, liquid investors can reduce the manager's cost of capital in future fundraising. We test the assumptions and predictions of our model in the context of the private equity industry.

We show that a spin-off increases the incumbent's chance of losing control to such a rival. This, in turn, motivates the incumbent either to work harder at managing the firm (in order to avoid any loss of control), or to relinquish control of one of the firms resulting from the spin-off (either immediately following the spin-off, or subsequently in a control contest).

For example, the 25 firms that paid the largest dividends in 2000 account for a majority of the aggregate dividends and earnings of industrial firms.

The evidence indicates that whole ownership is most common when firms coordinate integrated production activities across different locations, transfer technology, and benefit from worldwide tax planning. Because operations and ownership levels are jointly determined, it is helpful to use the liberalization of ownership restrictions by host countries and the imposition of joint venture tax penalties in the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 as instruments for ownership levels to identify these effects. Firms responded to these regulatory and tax changes by using wholly owned affiliates instead of joint ventures and expanding intrafirm trade and technology transfer. The implied complementarity of whole ownership and intrafirm trade suggests that the reduced costs of engaging in integrated global operations contributed substantially to the sharply declining propensity of American firms to organize their foreign operations as joint ventures over the last two decades. Estimates imply that as much as one-fifth to three-fifths of the decline in the use of joint ventures by multinational firms is attributable to the increased importance of intrafirm transactions.

This paper examines globalisation in terms of conflicts between markets and economic management, and suggests that the differential pace of globalisation across markets presents a number of challenges to policy makers in local, national and regional governments, and in international institutions. In examining the changing location and ownership strategies of MNEs, it shows that the increasingly sophisticated decision making of managers in MNEs is slicing the activities of firms more finely and in finding optimum locations for each closely defined activity, they are deepening the international division of labour. Ownership strategies, too, are becoming increasingly complex, leading to a control matrix that runs from wholly owned units via FDI through market relationships such as subcontracting, including joint ventures as options on subsequent decisions in a dynamic pattern. The input of lessons from economic geography is thus becoming more important in understanding the key developments in international business. The consequences of the globalisation of production and consumption represent political challenges, and reaction against these changes has led to a questioning of the effects of global capitalism as well as to its moral basis. These four issues are closely intertwined and present a formidable research agenda to which the international business research community is uniquely fitted to respond.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400076","perspective","JIBS","Management & Organizations","5","['globalisation', 'political challenges', 'moral basis', 'economic geography']","The article discusses the political challenges and moral basis of global capitalism, indicating a moderate engagement with social justice themes.

Second, differences in the development of intermediary markets in a particular place influence firm positioning and industry structure in that place, but their impact also crosses different places, and it is endogenous to the ecology of places and firms in a systemic, integrative way that makes simplifications extremely risky in the design of competitive strategy in an international context.

Second, IB scholars must pay more attention to topics that are not mainstream within the field but are of great importance to developing countries.

In the interest of expanding our understanding of the organizational mechanisms that both hinder and facilitate learning, the concept of LC is refined into three distinct components: resource-, incentive-, and cognitive-based LC. Further, the strength of the relationships between these theoretical constructs and knowledge transfer is examined in light of the possible moderating effects of organizational culture, firm size, and the form and competitive regime of the alliance. Consistently, learning intent (as a driver) and knowledge ambiguity (as an impediment) emerge as the most significant determinants of knowledge transfer. Moreover, the effects of partner protectiveness and LC on the learning outcome are moderated by the firm's own culture towards learning, the size of the firm, the structural form of the alliance, and the fact that partners may or may not be competitors.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400091","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge transfer', 'organizational learning', 'cultural', 'alliances']","The article primarily focuses on organizational learning and knowledge transfer in strategic alliances without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Knowledge flows, subsidiary power and rent-seeking within MNCs","In recent years, as multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries have become more closely linked to international networks, their knowledge intensity has risen, and some of their R&D has gained a more creative role. Simultaneously, and often connectedly, many subsidiaries have acquired considerable strategic independence in all aspects of their operations, and therefore are able to exercise considerable intra-firm bargaining power to influence the distribution of the firm's resources. In this context, we suggest that intra-MNC knowledge flows are a key determinant of subsidiary bargaining power. We argue that subsidiary managers can exploit such power to pursue their own ends. Such rent-seeking behavior is implicit in much of the literature on managerialism, but our analysis suggests that such behavior can now occur in headquarters\u2013subsidiary and subsidiary\u2013subsidiary relations. Thus subsidiary strategic independence, designed to enhance the competitiveness of outputs (market knowledge) and inputs (asset-seeking and learning), can be corroded when the pursuit of subsidiary objectives encourages rent-seeking.

An exploratory analysis, involving interviews with MNC managers, original case studies, and archival material, indicates that the transnational model of national responsiveness, global efficiency and worldwide learning may not be sufficient. Results suggest that the success of initiatives targeting low-income markets is enhanced by recognizing that Western-style patterns of economic development may not occur in these business environments.

However, arguments to date have examined the effect of adaptation primarily on a subsidiary's long-term performance. A necessary precursor is to understand the effect of adaptation on the transfer process itself, as transfer difficulty, or stickiness, may preclude the reuse of an organizational practice in the first place. In this paper, we explore how the adaptation of organizational practices affects the stickiness of cross-border transfers.

The dominant logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['cocreation', 'relationships', 'intangible resources']","The article discusses a shift in marketing logic towards cocreation and relationships, which hints at a more socially aware approach.

The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers\u2019 lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers\u2019 performance with that of competitors\u2019 drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.68.1.109.24030","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['corporate citizenship', 'customer equity', 'social perceptions']","The article discusses corporate citizenship and its impact on customer perceptions, indicating a moderate awareness of social responsibility.

In contrast to structure\u2013conduct\u2013performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance.

The results reveal a dynamic system in which some aspects of market knowledge diffusion propel innovation, whereas satisfaction with past performance hinders innovation effort.

Drawing on the helping behavior and boycott literature, the authors take a cost\u2013benefit approach to the decision to boycott and present a conceptualization of motivations for boycott participation. The authors tested their framework during an actual boycott of a multinational firm that was prompted by factory closings. Consumers who viewed the closures as egregious were more likely to boycott the firm, though only a minority did so. Four factors are found to predict boycott participation: the desire to make a difference, the scope for self-enhancement, counterarguments that inhibit boycotting, and the cost to the boycotter of constrained consumption. Furthermore, self-enhancement and constrained consumption are significant moderators of the relationship between the perceived egregiousness of the firm's actions and boycott participation.

These strategies differ in their essential structure and in their potential costs and benefits to the firm. Prior research has failed to understand how these branding strategies are related to the intangible value of the firm. The authors investigate this relationship using five-year data for a sample of 113 U.S. firms. They find that corporate branding strategy is associated with higher values of Tobin's q, and mixed branding strategy is associated with lower values of Tobin's q, after controlling for the effects of several important and relevant factors. The relationships of the control variables are consistent with prior expectations. In addition, most of the firms would have been able to improve their Tobin's q had they adopted a branding strategy different from the one their brand portfolios revealed.

The authors apply multivariate time-series models to the automobile industry, in which both new product introductions and promotional incentives are considered important performance drivers. Notably, whereas both marketing actions increase top-line firm performance, their long-term effects strongly differ for the bottom line. First, new product introductions increase long-term financial performance and firm value, but promotions do not. Second, investor reaction to new product introduction grows over time, indicating that useful information unfolds in the first two months after product launch.

The authors develop a theoretical framework to understand the relationships among (1) strategic responses to new technologies, (2) organizational resources, and (3) firm performance. Specifically, they theorize that a strategic response can be categorized according to the dimensions of magnitude, domain, and speed, and they conceptualize organizational resources as tangible and intangible. The authors operationalize this framework for the adoption of the Internet by traditional store-based retailers, for which they posit strategic responses as the speed of (1) adopting the Internet as a communications channel, (2) adopting the Internet as a sales channel, and (3) forming e-alliances. In addition, they use resource slack to represent organizational resources. Results from nine years (1992\u20132000) of data on 106 firms establish the influence of strategic responses on firm performance (i.e., market valuation of the firm, operationalized as Tobin's q). Specifically, the results show that both the adoption of the Internet as a communications channel and e-alliance formation positively influence firm performance. The positive effect of communications channel adoption on firm performance is enhanced further by the use of slack resources. Post hoc analysis reveals that the adoption of the Internet as a sales channel seems to matter only to firms that have preexisting catalog operations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.68.4.157.42730","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of strategic responses to technology adoption and firm performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They vary magnitude (response accuracy), respondent heterogeneity estimation method, and question-design method in a 4 \u00d7 23 experiment. The estimation methods are hierarchical Bayes and analytic center. The latter is a new individual-level estimation procedure that is a by-product of polyhedral question design.

The authors assert that customer winback should also be an important part of a customer relationship management strategy. Customer winback focuses on the reinitiation and management of relationships with customers who have lapsed or defected from a firm. In some cases, firms engage in extensive efforts to reacquire lapsed customers or defectors, and a common tactic is lowering the price to reacquire a customer. This investigation goes beyond the reacquisition pricing strategy and also examines the optimal pricing strategy when the customer has decided to reinitiate the relationship. By simultaneously modeling reacquisition and duration of the second tenure with the firm, the authors determine that the optimal pricing strategy for their application involves a low reacquisition price and higher prices when customers have been reacquired.

The authors define the value of a customer as the expected sum of discounted future earnings. They demonstrate their valuation method by using publicly available data for five firms.

For example, to target consumers for a coupon mailing, a retail chain may want to predict whether a prospective customer's grocery expenditures exceed a predetermined threshold. The current approach to this prediction problem is to model the response variable and then apply the discretizing function to the predicted value of the response variable. In contrast with this \u201cindirect\u201d approach, the authors propose a \u201cdirect\u201d approach in which they model discretized values of the response variable. They show theoretically that the direct approach achieves better predictive performance than the commonly used indirect approach when the response model is misspecified and the sample size is large. These two conditions are commonly met in direct marketing situations. This result is counterintuitive because the direct approach entails \u201cthrowing away\u201d information. However, although both the discretized response data and the continuous data provide biased predictions when a misspecified model is used, the lower information content of the discretized variable helps the bias be smaller. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation experiment, a retail targeting application, and a customer satisfaction application. The key managerial implication of the result is that the current practice of restricting attention to models based on the indirect approach may be suboptimal. Target marketers should expand the set of candidate models to include models based on the proposed direct approach.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.1.73.25081","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to improving predictive performance in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As innovations affect markets, there is a pressing need to develop market response models that can adapt to such changes. The authors' model copes with the challenges that dynamic environments entail: nonstationarity, changes in parameters over time, missing data, and cross-sectional heterogeneity. They use this approach to model sales response in the frozen pizza category, in which the introduction of rising-crust pizza brands represents a major innovation. The model is directly applicable to other domains in which market structure might be nonstationary, such as changes in promotion strategy, shifts in the retail environment, and movements in macroeconomic factors. The authors find that innovation (1) makes the existing brands appear more similar, as indicated by increasing cross-brand price elasticities; (2) decreases brand differentiation for the existing brands, as indicated by an increase in the magnitude of own-brand price elasticities; and (3) increases the variance of the sales response equations temporarily around the time of the introduction of the innovation, indicating increased uncertainty in sales response. The authors discuss the managerial implications by presenting maps of how clout and vulnerability evolve over time, assessing the effect of new brands on cannibalization, and considering the strategic implications of the introduction of a flanker innovation to facilitate an extant brand's ability to attack an incumbent leader.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.2.166.28669","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product innovation and market response models without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This practice can be problematic if there are unobservable factors that affect the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. When such a correlation exists, it is important to model simultaneously the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. The authors propose a model suitable for scanner-panel data in which the no-purchase decision depends on the price, feature, and display of each brand in the category and on household stock of inventory. They link the no-purchase model to the brand-choice outcome through marketing-mix covariates and through unobservables that affect both outcomes. The authors assume that model parameters are heterogeneous across households and allow for a flexible correlation structure between the coefficients in the no-purchase model and those in the brand-choice model. The model formulation is more general than what is possible from either a nested logit model or a translog utility model and from models in which the no-purchase outcome is an additional outcome with the deterministic component of its utility set equal to zero. The authors estimate the proposed model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods.

The authors show how their model generalizes the LCM by the mere addition of S + 1 parameters, where S refers to the number of segments. Because a limitation of the traditional LCM is that it does not adequately account for heterogeneity in responses across households, the authors' model mitigates this criticism leveled at the LCM.

Most of the proposed methodologies in the marketing literature require household panel data, which can be difficult to obtain. There is a growing stream of work in marketing and in empirical industrial organization that estimates segmentation structure with aggregate data. This article is a careful attempt to understand the extent to which disaggregate structure in the form of a latent-class model can be recovered from aggregate data. The authors show that under specific assumptions and when the household-level model is correctly specified, most of a latent-class segmentation structure is identifiable even if only store-level aggregate data are available. Therefore, the store data-based estimates for the latent-class model are consistent. In other words, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the estimates goes to zero with infinite sample size. To assess how well latent-class structure can be estimated from store data sets of sample sizes that are comparable to those in real life, the authors simulate more than 60,000 store data sets and compute the consequent model estimates and their estimation errors. The results show that the MAD of the latent-class estimates diminishes much more slowly with store data than with household data. Moreover, the rate is so slow that obtaining estimates with reasonably small MADs often requires unreasonably large sample sizes. The authors' simulations offer guidance on conditions that favor obtaining more accurate estimates from store-level data.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.3.351.35988","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for estimating consumer response segments using aggregate data, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, the authors provide an empirical demonstration of their approach and test whether learning in conjoint studies occurs; to what extent; and in what manner it affects responses, partworths, and the relative importance of attributes. They show that the relative importance of attribute partworths can shift when subjects evaluate partial profiles, which suggests that consumers may construct rather than retrieve partworths and are sensitive to the order in which the profiles are presented. Finally, the results show that consumers' imputation processes can be influenced by manipulating their prior information about a product category. This research is of both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this research sheds light on how customers integrate different sources of information in evaluating products with incomplete attribute information; practically, it highlights the potential pitfalls of imputing missing attribute levels using simple rules and develops a better behavioral model for describing and predicting customers' ratings for partial conjoint profiles.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.369.47018","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for imputing missing data in conjoint analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2004","41","4","Eric T.

Results from the model offer predictions on the relationships among coupon redemptions, shelf price, and coupon face value. The authors test these predictions on a large data set of hundreds of coupon events across six packaged goods categories. The data show that when a small coupon face value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory. When a firm moves from uniform pricing (e.g., no coupons) to second-degree price discrimination (e.g., coupons), all consumers may face a lower price.

Prior research on choice deferral has presented the no-choice option as just another response option (i.e., an unconditional brand-choice response mode), which has its primary focus on the selection decision. However, consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and choice deferral for the two response modes.

In this article, the authors adapt the SPC framework to accommodate characteristics of business markets, specifically the complex decision-making unit, strategic supplier selection, and resource allocation at the individual customer level. They also extend the SPC framework to allow for a richer description of the complex linkages between vendor effort and account profitability, namely, nonlinear linkages and differential responsiveness occasioned by customer-specific factors such as competitive context. Controlling for such factors illuminates, to some degree, why similar levels of customer management effort and/or performance can yield quite different customer profitability outcomes. The authors present an application that demonstrates how adaptation and extension of the SPC to business markets can provide vendors with (1) insights into the process that culminates in individual customer profitability and (2) useful guidelines for adapting their customer management efforts at the individual account level with an aim to improve account profitability.

Previous cross-category studies have typically assumed that the cross-category effects are the same across brands or items because the potential number of price effects to be estimated is large. The authors address this problem by decomposing the variability of cross-category price effects into two components: variability across items and across stores. They capture the variability across items by representing the item-level parameters as draws from distributions with category-level means. They account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen, and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than that of store brands on national brands. In addition, the model supports the implementation of price zones at a more granular level than the current practice.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.448.47017","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical sales model for analyzing brand competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-driven approach."],["2004","41","4","Joseph C.

Response models condition on the observed marketing-mix variables and focus on the specification of the distribution of observed sales given marketing-mix activities. The models usually fail to recognize that the levels of the marketing-mix variables are often chosen with at least partial knowledge of the response parameters in the conditional model. This means that contrary to standard assumptions, the marginal distribution of the marketing-mix variables is not independent of response parameters. The authors expand on the standard conditional model to include a model for the determination of the marketing-mix variables. They apply this modeling approach to the problem of gauging the effectiveness of sales calls (details) to induce greater prescribing of drugs by individual physicians. They do not assume a priori that details are set optimally, but instead they infer the extent to which sales force managers have knowledge of responsiveness, and they use this knowledge to set the level of sales force contact. The authors find that their modeling approach improves the precision of the physician-specific response parameters significantly. They also find that physicians are not detailed optimally; high-volume physicians are detailed to a greater extent than low-volume physicians without regard to responsiveness to detailing. It appears that unresponsive but high-volume physicians are detailed the most.

Using social network theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in previous research.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.479.47015","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing systems and buyer-supplier relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Guided by a selection of difficult instances from MIPLIB and real instances obtained from brain-tumor research, various strategies of cut synchronization are considered, and their influence on speedup, communication overhead, load balance, and effectiveness in closing the integrality gap are studied. The parallel cutting-plane algorithm is coupled with an LP-based heuristic to assist in returning a good quality integer feasible solution upon termination of the parallel process. The parallel implementation is sufficiently coarse-grained to yield an average of less than 6% of the total time performing tasks associated with communication overhead, and it provides reasonable speedup when executing in parallel. Noticeable differences in load-balance scores are observed, depending on the number of processors used, the synchronization scheme used, and the structure of the MIP problem instance. Nevertheless, the synergism of the combined collection of cuts generated locally on each processor is effective in closing the integrality gap in all cases, and there is minimal variability in the amount of the gap closed as the number of processors varies. In particular, the degree of decentralization, as governed by the synchronization schemes, has little effect on the overall quality of the cuts generated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0027","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of algorithm implementation in a computing environment without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The preemptive variant of the scheduling problem with irregular cost functions corresponds to the one-dimensional continuous assignment problem and a lower bound for the non-preemptive variant can be derived. It is computationally tested in a branch-and-bound algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0034","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in scheduling and cost minimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2004","16","2","Mutsunori YagiuraMutsunori Yagiurayagiura@i.kyoto-u.ac.jpDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.Search for more papers by this author, Toshihide IbarakiToshihide Ibarakiibaraki@i.kyoto-u.ac.jpDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.Search for more papers by this author, Fred GloverFred Gloverfred.glover@colorado.eduLeeds School of Business, University of Colorado at Boulder, Campus Box 419, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0419, USA.Search for more papers by this author","An Ejection Chain Approach for the Generalized Assignment Problem","We propose a tabu search algorithm for the generalized assignment problem, which is one of the representative combinatorial optimization problems known to be NP-hard.

In a WDM wavelength-routed network, end users communicate with one another using all-optical channels called lightpaths. Such lightpaths are used to support point-to-point connections and may span multiple fiber links. In the absence of wavelength translators, a lightpath must use the same wavelengths from origin to destination along each fiber span. Translators located at nodes permit wavelength translation within a lightpath. This investigation presents an empirical study comparing solutions that forbid translation with those that permit translation. For our 20 test problems, the extreme cases of no translation and translation at every node are solvable using CPLEX. For the more difficult intermediate cases, a special tabu search heuristic was developed. For those difficult cases, the tabu search procedure ran approximately 25 times faster than CPLEX using the default settings and in 78% of the problem instances found solutions that were as good as or better than those found by CPLEX.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0038","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization models in telecommunications without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

In particular, Internet and insurance risk problems may involve heavy-tailed distributions. A difficulty with heavy-tailed distributions is that they may not have closed-form, analytic Laplace transforms. This makes numerical methods, which use the Laplace transform, challenging. In this paper, we develop a method for approximating Laplace transforms. Using the approximation, we give algorithms to compute the steady state probability distribution of the waiting time of an M/G/1 queue to a desired accuracy. We give several numerical examples, and we validate the approximation with known results where possible or with simulations otherwise. We also give convergence proofs for the methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0045","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of queueing theory and numerical methods without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The characteristics of the servers involved as well as the specific requirements of the rides may vary. Problems are defined on some metric space, and the goal is to find a feasible solution that minimizes a certain objective function. The structure of these problems allows for a notation similar to the standard notation for scheduling and queueing problems. We introduce such a notation and show how a class of 7,930 dial-a-ride problem types arises from this approach. In examining their computational complexity, we define a partial ordering on the problem class and incorporate it in the computer program DARCLASS. As input DARCLASS uses lists of problems whose complexity is known. The output is a classification of all problems into one of three complexity classes: solvable in polynomial time, NP-hard, or open. For a selection of the problems that form the input for DARCLASS, we exhibit a proof of polynomial-time solvability or NP-hardness.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0052","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of computational complexity in dial-a-ride problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One aspect of this is our growing repository of Online Supplements housed permanently on our website. As I write this, there are some 17 supplements supporting 18 papers, and several more are in development. I invite you to peruse them for a flavor of the kinds of things that we\u2019re able to do in JOC. They include voluminous material for which we don\u2019t have room in the papers themselves, as well as a wide variety of other information in forms not amenable to inclusion in the papers, like downloadable code, data sets, and links to other sites. And as a purely practical budgetary matter, the Online Supplements allow us to shorten some papers, thus making room for more research to appear closer to the completion of the actual work, without impeding access. (It\u2019s hard to imagine any JOC readers at all without ready Internet access.) If you\u2019re an author, you might also think about creative ways to enhance your papers via this medium . . . we\u2019re certainly game to try out new ideas. The Summer 2004 and Fall 2004 issues will focus our attention on the growing and critically important field of biology and on what our community has to offer the exciting prospects there. The Summer 2004 issue will begin with a state-ofthe- art survey on the topic, and the Fall 2004 issue will be a Special Issue devoted entirely to biology. Founding Editor-in-Chief Harvey Greenberg has been the driving force behind both of these efforts. Also in development is a special issue on OR in electrical and computer engineering, guest-edited by John Chinneck. And a special cluster of papers on computation in music will be guest-edited by Elaine Chew. So, running the gamut from electrical engineering to biology to music, we are definitely charting new directions in OR and CS, as our tag line claims.

As the order of the MRG increases, the number of possible sets of multipliers to be examined grows exponentially. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm for designing good MRGs. The set of multipliers associated with the MRG is encoded as a binary string. Via the operations of reproduction, crossover, and mutation, new sets of multipliers are generated. The spectral values of the MRGs are calculated to guide the search process. As an illustration, the proposed algorithm is employed to find good sets of multipliers for MRGs of orders three and four. The results are better than those derived from other studies. To conclude, this paper not only finds better MRGs of orders three and four, but also develops an algorithm for designing MRGs of higher orders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0039","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of random number generation and algorithm design without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

An adaptive penalty approach is used that exploits the short-term memory structure of the tabu list along with the long-term memory of the search results. It is shown to be effective on a variety of combinatorial problems with different degrees and numbers of constraints. The approach requires few parameters, is robust to their setting, and encourages search in promising regions of the feasible and infeasible regions before converging to a final feasible solution. The method is tested on three diverse NP-hard problems, facility layout, system reliability optimization, and orienteering, and is compared with two other penalty approaches developed explicitly for tabu search. The proposed memory-based approach shows consistent strong performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0040","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization method for constrained problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Since finding a feasible solution of such problems is in general NP-complete, the classical approaches have been the use of heuristics to find good feasible solutions on the one hand, or branch and cut on the other hand. In the case of the former, a dual bound is not available, and there is no guarantee of solution quality. For the latter, the accent has been on improving the dual bound and only the simplest schemes have been used to find good feasible solutions. Here we first show that such simple schemes may run into trouble, even when applied to very simple problems. This motivates the proposed heuristic, IPE, which is designed to be used within a branch-and-cut approach. We test the performance of the heuristic on various published lot-sizing and network-design problems, with and without tightened reformulations. We compare these results with other heuristics and with time truncated branch-and-bound searches.

In this paper, we study the collective counts of palindromes in the SARS genome along with all the completely sequenced coronaviruses. Based on a Markov-chain model for the genome sequence, the mean and standard deviation for the number of palindromes at or above a given length are derived. These theoretical results are complemented by extensive simulations to provide empirical estimates. Using a z score obtained from these mathematical and empirical means and standard deviations, we have observed that palindromes of length four are significantly underrepresented in all the coronaviruses in our data set. In contrast, length-six palindromes are significantly underrepresented only in the SARS coronavirus. Two other features are unique to the SARS sequence. First, there is a length-22 palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA spanning positions 25962\u201325983.

On simulated data, our blocks resemble the true partition more than the blocks generated by the LD-based algorithm of Gabriel et al (2002).

The side chain positioning problem takes a fixed backbone and a protein sequence and predicts the lowest energy conformation of the protein's side chains on this backbone. We study a widely used version of the problem where the side chain positioning procedure uses a rotamer library and an energy function that can be expressed as a sum of pairwise terms. The problem is NP-complete; we show that it cannot even be approximated. In practice, it is tackled by a variety of general search techniques and specialized heuristics. Here, we propose formulating the side chain positioning problem as an instance of semidefinite programming (SDP). We introduce two novel rounding schemes and provide theoretical justification for their effectiveness under various conditions. We apply our method on simulated data, as well as on the computational redesign of two naturally occurring protein cores, and show that our SDP approach generally finds good solutions. Beyond the context of side chain positioning, our very general rounding schemes should be applicable elsewhere.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0096","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in protein structure prediction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a survey of approximation algorithms for various alignment problems with constraints, and several new approximation algorithms. These approximations are in two distinct senses: In one the constraints are satisfied but the score computed is within a prescribed tolerance of the optimum instead of the exact optimum. In another, the alignment returned is assured to have at least the optimum score with respect to the given constraints, but the length constraints are satisfied to within a prescribed tolerance from the required values.

With the growth of genomic data, much of which does not fit ideal tree models, there is greater need to understand the algorithmics and combinatorics of phylogenetic networks (Posada and Crandall 2001, Schierup and Hein 2000). Wang et al. (2001) studied the problem of constructing a phylogenetic network for a set of n binary sequences derived from the all-zero ancestral sequence, when each site in the sequence can mutate from zero to one at most once in the network, and recombination between sequences is allowed. They showed that the problem of minimizing the number of recombinations in such networks is NP-hard, but introduced a special case of the problem, i.e., to determine whether the sequences could be derived on a phylogenetic network where the recombination cycles are node-disjoint. Wang et al. (2001) provide a sufficient, but not a necessary test, for such solutions. Gusfield et al. (2003, 2004) gave a polynomial-time algorithm that is both a necessary and sufficient test. In this paper, we study in much more detail the fine combinatorial structure of node-disjoint cycles in phylogenetic networks, both for purposes of insight into phylogenetic networks and to speed up parts of the previous algorithm. We explicitly characterize all the ways in which mutations can be arranged on a disjoint cycle, and prove a strong necessary condition for a set of mutations to be on a disjoint cycle. The main contribution here is to show how structure in the phylogenetic network is reflected in the structure of an efficiently-computable graph, called the conflict graph. The success of this approach suggests that additional insight into the structure of phylogenetic networks can be obtained by exploring structural properties of the conflict graph.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0099","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of phylogenetic networks and algorithmic challenges without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In this study, we present a discrete event simulation model inspired by and validated in an actual manufacturing setting that includes short product life cycles, mid-volume production quantities, and a production environment consisting of assembly, inspection and testing.\n            \n            The effect of worker skill dynamics is analyzed using a factorial experimental design that contrasts the use of temporary versus permanent workers on manufacturing cost performance. The manufacturing costs assessed include labor, inspection and testing. The cost of reworking a defect is captured as an increase in the labor consumption. Materials costs are not assessed. At the core of the analysis, it is assumed that temporary workers have relatively less skill and therefore have higher average production times, higher average defect rates associated with their assembly activity, and lower rates of learning. In addition, the variance of the production time is higher for the temporary workers.

Other transaction-level conditions and firm-level attributes also affect PDS quality, as measured by availability, timeliness, and reliability. Most notably, when the net price of products transacted increases, PDS reliability and availability decline. Furthermore, Internet-retailer size is found to favor PDS availability whereas, surprisingly, newer Internet retailers exhibit a higher level of PDS availability than many of their incumbent competitors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2003.11.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of physical distribution service quality without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

At the same time, regulatory agencies, industry experts, and consumers increasingly demand that health care organizations learn from prior failures to prevent recurrence. Building on the notion that learning from operational failures requires an accurate understanding of their nature, this paper reports on an in-depth study of operational failures encountered by hospital nurses. Data analysis suggests that in this context (1) most operational failures stem from breakdowns in the supply of materials and information across organizational boundaries and (2) employees quickly compensate for most failures. We propose that these two conditions\u2014lack of control of processes that create failures and the ease with which employees restore functioning\u2014make it difficult for organizations to recognize these incidents as learning opportunities, and if they do, to capitalize on the opportunity. This has an important implication for efforts to generate organizational learning and improvement from employees\u2019 experiences with failures. Highly interdependent front-line workers do not control organizational processes responsible for the majority of failures they encounter and have a difficult task convincing powerful associates that these obstacles warrant solution efforts, making it likely operational failures will persist.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2003.12.006","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['operational failures', 'organizational learning', 'employees', 'quality of care']","The article discusses operational failures and their impact on employees and patient care, which touches on themes of workplace conditions and organizational learning.

Consequently in this paper, we address the issue of manufacturing flexibility measurement, and then use these measures to better understand flexibility. Churchill\u2019s [J. Market. Res. 16 (1979) 64] paradigm is used to develop psychometrically sound measures for six oft-used dimensions of manufacturing flexibility: machine, labor, material handling, mix, new product, and modification. Previous research shows that each of these dimensions, in turn, is comprised of four elements. The resulting 24 scales (6 dimensions\u00d74 elements) demonstrate the desired properties of unidimensionality, reliability, and validity. We show further that the four elements of any given manufacturing flexibility dimension can be grouped into two conceptually separate factors representing \u201cScope\u201d and \u201cAchievability\u201d of flexible responses. Scope and achievability factor scores can be used to compare a subset of firms with respect to their flexibility choices, and observe the trade-offs firms make both within and across flexibility dimensions. Along with scale development, establishing scope versus achievability relationships between flexibility elements provides a better basis for measuring and creating a holistic understanding of this complex concept.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.01.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of manufacturing flexibility without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of 'woke' themes."],["2004","22","3","Mikko A Ketokivi,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Mikko A Ketokivi\n                     \n                        mikko.ketokivi@hut.fi\n                     \n                     Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, P.O.

Especially needed are examinations of systematic informant bias and the related method variance and method bias, which are not captured by conventional methods used in operations management to assess construct reliability and validity. We conduct a multitrait\u2013multimethod analysis of perceptual performance measures to investigate item-specific trait, method and error variance. Data from 164 factories with three informants per factory is analyzed.

The findings show that most of previously inefficient JMSs, on average, have become relative more efficient through DEA recommendation remedial actions. Three JMSs increased their technical and pure technical efficiencies; and one JMS increased its scale efficiency. Few JMSs were operating at increasing returns to scale, indicating a potential to expand.

As a developing country, China has to balance economic and environmental performance. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is emerging to be an important approach for Chinese enterprises to improve performance, possibly on both these dimensions. Using empirical results from 186 respondents on GSCM practice in Chinese manufacturing enterprises, we examine the relationships between GSCM practice and environmental and economic performance. Using moderated hierarchical regression analysis, we evaluate the general relationships between specific GSCM practices and performance. We then investigate how two primary types of management operations philosophies, quality management and just-in-time (or lean) manufacturing principles, influence the relationship between GSCM practices and performance. Significant findings were determined for a number of relationships. Managerial implications are also identified.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.01.005","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['green supply chain management', 'environmental performance', 'sustainability']","The article discusses green supply chain management and its impact on environmental performance, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical practices in operations management.

Advocates of TQM have suggested that there should be a positive relationship between implementing TQM practices and financial performance measures. The empirical evidence supporting this assertion, however, is limited at best. Most of the research has been limited to surveys of managers\u2019 perceptions of the effect of TQM on financial performance. A few empirical studies using financial performance measures have been done, and have shown that TQM firms have better financial performance than other firms. However, better performing companies may be more likely to adopt TQM, so that rather than being a path to improved financial success (causation), TQM merely \u201ccomes along for the ride\u201d (covariation). This study examined the relationship between TQM and financial performance, using a sample of Baldrige Award winners and replicated with a second sample of state quality award winning companies, and three different sets of financial performance measures. Both Baldrige and state quality award winners generally had better financial performance than their peers after winning a quality award, and before.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.02.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the relationship between Total Quality Management (TQM) and financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Highly technical industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and service industries like banking are relying on fewer but more skilled workers. In these systems, productivity depends on worker availability and organization; therefore, modeling system performance may require accurate representations of individual worker behavior. This paper examines the tradeoffs in including information about the demographics and personalities of workers in system performance simulation models. A series of actual and simulated experiments in which personality and demographic data are used in different ways to model the performance of a team of workers is reported. Significant differences are found in predicted system performance demonstrating that model validity depends on the methodology used for modeling workers. These results have practical implication for the managerial processes of recruiting and selecting individual workers, as well as organizing teams of workers and assigning them to tasks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.05.003","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['demographic', 'personality', 'modeling', 'workers']","The article discusses the inclusion of demographic and personality information in modeling worker performance, which touches on themes of diversity and representation.

Using a model of a manually-paced assembly area, we examine three workforce management practices\u2014the configuration of work teams, the extent of cross training, and the deployment of workers\u2014that have the potential to enhance the level of manufacturing flexibility. We examine the effects of these practices at the level of the individual operation and individual worker, with the goal of maximizing overall system performance in a variety of manufacturing environments. Our results indicate that the value of workforce flexibility is contingent upon characteristics of the operating environment. Environments having high levels of product variety call for the use of a larger number of parallel work teams, while environments with highly complex tasks tend to require a smaller number of parallel teams. Further, the value of cross training and worker task sharing is diminished as work tasks become more complex, due to learning and forgetting effects on the workforce. The overall implication is that more worker flexibility does not always yield improved system performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.05.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of workforce management and manufacturing flexibility without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Driving this project was recognition that the current process, initially designed to accommodate a single customer group, was ill equipped to handle a changing customer mix now consisting of three disparate groups. The resulting mismatch between the process and users created long delays and an increase in the overall level of dissatisfaction with the existing process. To improve overall performance, this study turned to process analysis and computer simulation to stimulate a critical analysis of the process. As part of this approach, the study investigated three layouts: the existing worker paced assembly line, a modified assembly line, and service cells. The study examined the relationship between layout, customer mix and system performance.

These guided vehicles can be routed with a variety of vehicle dispatching rules in an attempt to meet performance criteria such as minimizing the average load waiting times. In this research, we use simulation models of three companies to evaluate the performance of several real-time vehicle dispatching rules, in part described in the literature. It appears that there is a clear difference in average load waiting time between the different dispatching rules in the different environments. Simple rules, based on load and vehicle proximity (distance-based) perform best for all cases. The penalty for this is a relatively high maximum load waiting time. A distance-based rule with time truncation, giving more priority to loads that have to wait longer than a time threshold, appears to yield the best possible overall performance. A rule that particularly considers load-waiting time performs poor overall. We also show that using little pre-arrival information of loads leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the dispatching rules without changing their performance ranking.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.05.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical performance metrics related to vehicle dispatching rules without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The findings indicate substantial differences in patterns of cumulative capabilities between countries and limited evidence of industry differences. Cumulative capabilities were found to be related to plant performance, with no difference in this relationship by industry. Support for sequential progression of cumulative capabilities was not evident, leading to the notion that development of cumulative capabilities is a complex endeavor, affected by many interrelated contingencies, not limited to sequence of development.

Yet, claims of the strategic role of purchasing have not been fully subjected to rigorous theoretical and empirical scrutiny.

In this paper, we examine the links among strategic purchasing, supply management, and firm performance.\n            \n            We argue that strategic purchasing can engender sustainable competitive advantage by enabling firms to: (a) foster close working relationships with a limited number of suppliers; (b) promote open communication among supply-chain partners; and (c) develop long-term strategic relationship orientation to achieve mutual gains. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically test a number of hypothesized relationships based on a sample of 221 United States manufacturing firms. Our results provide robust support for the links between strategic purchasing, supply management, customer responsiveness, and financial performance of the buying firm.

For example, Deming proposed The Deming System of Profound Knowledge\u2122 that dealt explicitly with knowledge. However, various authors in the quality field diverge considerably when contemplating knowledge. We propose an integrated view of quality and knowledge using Nonaka's theory of knowledge creation. This integrated view helps illuminate how quality practices can lead to knowledge creation and retention. The knowledge perspective also provides insight into what it means to effectively deploy quality management practices. Previous empirical research noted the importance of effective deployment, but provided little insight into what effective deployment means. This research argues that quality management practices create knowledge, which leads to organizational performance. Taking a knowledge-based view (KBV) of the firm provides a deeper understanding of why some organizations are more successful at deploying quality management practices than others.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['quality management', 'knowledge creation', 'organizational performance']","The article primarily focuses on quality management practices and knowledge creation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Integration practices are grouped into two categories: (1) external strategic design integration, which reaches across firm boundaries to involve suppliers and customers and (2) internal design-process integration, which comprises more tactically oriented, integration practices that match design requirements and process capabilities. First, regression results show that both internal and external integration are related to time-based performance, which in turn is related to firm performance. Thus, two indirect routes to firm performance are identified. Second, hierarchical regression reveals that integration directly affects firm performance even after time-based performance is accounted for. Finally, we found that the interaction of internal and external integration is significantly related to both market share and financial performance (after controlling for all other effects). This latter result suggests that the joint use of external and internal integration practices has a synergistic effect on firm performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of integration practices and their impact on performance metrics, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2004","22","6","John G.

We further investigate contingency relationships between the development of a QMS and its organizational contexts. Based on cluster analyses of quality management practices measured by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) criteria, we found four patterns of service quality management practices: undeveloped, accommodating, strategic, and soft quality systems. Our research indicates that the type of quality system adopted by an organization is highly associated with organizational contextual factors. Our results indicate that environmental uncertainty shapes the development of a QMS in the early stage, while the perceived importance of quality induces the further development of a QMS to a strategic quality system. The results also show that small service firms that compete locally can achieve very good performance results using a soft quality system, a QMS with no formal process management systems. This research provides empirical evidence on contingent relationships among quality management practices, organizational context, and business performance, thus contributing to contingency theory in quality management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['quality management', 'organizational context', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on empirical analysis of quality management systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Both subjective and objective data were collected. Some elements of labor and machine flexibility mediated the relationship between an emphasis on competitive priorities and mix flexibility. The interactive effects of machine and labor flexibility on mix flexibility confirmed prior findings that the pursuit of total flexibility is not desirable. For low levels of labor flexibility, increasing machine flexibility yields at the most a very moderate improvement in mix flexibility. When labor flexibility is high, increasing machine flexibility proves to be counter-productive. These results may suggest that the traditional forms of labor flexibility need to evolve when technological capabilities are more fully exploited.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.005","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['labor flexibility', 'machine flexibility', 'competitive priorities']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of operations management without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This paper presents arguments that users may not be primarily concerned with the number of ideas generated when planning a brainstorming session, but rather may equally desire group well being and member support.  We present theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggesting that electronic brainstorming is not as effective as verbal brainstorming at providing group well being and member support. We believe that these arguments may also apply to other group and individual research areas and may also call for a reevaluation of the technology acceptance model (TAM).

While prior studies have examined the benefits to network leaders from these systems, little attention has been paid to the benefits to supplier firms.  This study draws from organizational theories of learning and action and transaction cost theory to propose a model relating suppliers\u2019 use of SCMS to benefits.  It proposes that two patterns of SCMS use by suppliers\u2014exploitation and exploration\u2014create contexts for suppliers to make relationship-specific investments in business processes and domain knowledge.  These, in turn, enable suppliers to both create value and retain a portion of the value created by the use of these systems in interfirm relationships.\n\nData from 131 suppliers using an SCMS implemented by one large retailer support hypotheses that relationship-specific intangible investments play a mediating role linking SCMS use to benefits.  Evidence that patterns of information technology use are significant determinants of relationship-specific investments in business processes and domain expertise provides a finer-grained explanation of the logic of IT-enabled electronic integration. The results support the vendors-to-partners thesis that IT deployments in supply chains lead to closer buyer-supplier relationships (Bakos and Brynjyolfsson 1993). The results also suggest the complementarity of the transaction-cost and resource-based views, elaborating the logic by which specialized assets can also be strategic assets.","https://misq.umn.edu/how-do-suppliers-benefit-from-information-technology-use-in-supply-chain-relationships.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['supply chain', 'value', 'relationships']","The article primarily focuses on the technical and economic aspects of supply chain management systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Our analysis indicates significant heterogeneity exists in the user base of these representative electronic markets.  Using online auction data from 1999 and 2000, we find a stable taxonomy of bidder behavior containing five types of bidding strategies. Bidders pursue different bidding strategies that, in aggregate, realize different winning likelihoods and consumer surplus.  We find that technological evolution has an impact on bidders\u2019 strategies.  We demonstrate how the taxonomy of bidder behavior can be used to enhance the design of some types of information systems.

Four types of interpersonal trust\u2014calculative, competence, relational, and integrated\u2014are identified and operationalized as a single construct.  We found support for an association between calculative, competence, and relational interpersonal trust and performance.  Our finding of a positive association between integrated interpersonal trust and performance not only yields the strongest support for a relationship between trust and VCR performance but also contradicts prior research.  Our findings indicate that the different types of trust are interrelated in that positive assessments of all three types of trust are necessary if VCRs are to have strongly positive performance.  The study also established that if any one type of trust is negative, then it is very likely that VCR performance will not be positive.  Our findings indicate that integrated types of interpersonal trust are interdependent, and the various patterns of interaction among them are such that they are mutually reinforcing.

Recognizing the difficulty that a practitioner and a scientific researcher can have in communicating across the world of science and the world of practice, dialogical action research offers, as its centerpiece, reflective one-on-one dialogues between the practitioner and the scientific researcher, taking place periodically in a setting removed from the practitioner\u2019s organization.  The dialogue itself serves as the interface between the world of science, marked by theoria and the scientific attitude, and the world of the practitioner, marked by praxis and the natural attitude of everyday life.  The dialogue attempts to address knowledge heterogeneity, which refers to the different forms that knowledge takes in the world of science and the world of practice, and knowledge contextuality, which refers to the dependence of the meaning of knowledge, such as a scientific theory or professional expertise, on its context.  In successive dialogues, the scientific researcher and the practitioner build a mutual understanding, including an understanding of the organization and its problems.  The scientific researcher, based on one or more of the scientific theories in her discipline, formulates and suggests one or more actions for the practitioner to take in order to solve or remedy a problem in his organization.  Dialogical action research recognizes that the practitioner\u2019s experience, expertise, and tacit knowledge, or praxis, largely shapes how he understands the suggested actions and appropriates them as his own.  Upon returning to his organization, he takes one or more of the suggested actions, depending on his reading of the situation at hand.  The reactions or responses of the problem to the actions or stimuli of the practitioner would embody, in the practitioner\u2019s eyes, success or failure in solving or remedying the problem and, in the scientific researcher\u2019s eyes, evidence confirming or disconfirming the theory on which the action was based.

The analysis suggests that while most firms are lagging in their supplier-side initiatives relative to the customer-side, supplier-side digitization has a strong positive impact on customer-side digitization, which, in turn, leads to better financial performance.  Further, both customer and supplier readiness to engage in digital interactions are shown to be as important as a firm\u2019s internal digitization initiatives, implying that a firm\u2019s transformation-related decisions should include its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 resources and incentives.","https://misq.umn.edu/an-empirical-investigation-of-net-enabled-business-value.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of business value creation through digital transformation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A mindful firm attends to an IT innovation with reasoning grounded in its own organizational facts and specifics.  We contrast this with mindless innovation, where a firm\u2019s actions betray an absence of such attention and grounding.  We develop these concepts by drawing on the recent appearance of the idea of mindfulness in the organizational literature, and adapting it for application to IT innovation.  We then bring mindfulness and mindlessness together in a larger theoretical synthesis in which these apparent opposites are seen to interact in ways that help to shape the overall landscape of opportunity for organizational innovation with IT.

The current challenge is to view this as a plateau and not an endpoint, and to seek ways of improving EBS performance.  In this study, we apply theory from cognitive psychology and adopt the individual, rather than the group, as the unit of analysis.  We present a model of idea generation cognition based on Hintzman\u2019s MINERVA2 global matching model of memory cognition and additional literature from cognitive psychology on cueing and categorization.  Based on this model, we present a technique called cause cueing, which directs subjects\u2019 attention to the causes of the target problem that they themselves have identified, and hypothesize that this will increase the number of ideas that an individual generates.  Also based on the model\u2014 and consistent with current views on production blocking\u2014we hypothesize that receiving input from others during brainstorming will reduce the number of ideas that an individual generates.  Following is an EBS-based study that offers an empirical examination of (1) the effects of cueing attention to natural categories (causes) during idea generation and (2) the effects of cueing attention to ad hoc categories, represented by input from others, during idea generation.  A total of 82 subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design ANOVA experiment.  Results indicate strong support for our model of idea generation as memory cognition.  Cueing participant attention to natural self-generated search categories via the cause cueing technique greatly increased the generation of ideas and high quality ideas, whether or not participants were also cued to attend to ad hoc categories (input from others).  Cueing attention to input from others was detrimental to the generation of ideas and the number of high quality ideas, clearly diminishing the positive effects of cueing to natural categories.  We explain how our theorizing and results are consistent with and extend earlier production blocking orientations in EBS research.  We also examine limitations of current EBS designs and suggest how prevailing methodologies can be modified to better support idea generation cognition.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-role-of-individual-memory-and-attention-processes-during-electronic-brainstorming.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive psychology and individual performance in electronic brainstorming without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When quantities are discrete, there is no guarantee that derivatives of the utility function are equal to derivatives of the budget constraint. Moreover, when prices are nonlinear, as in the case of quantity discounts, first-order conditions can be associated with the minimum rather than the maximum value of utility. In these cases, the utility function must be directly evaluated to determine its maximum. This evaluation can be computationally challenging when there exist many offerings and when stochastic elements are introduced into the utility function. In this paper, we provide an economic model of demand for substitute brands that is flexible, parsimonious, and easy to implement. The methodology is demonstrated with a scanner panel data set of light-beer purchases. The model is used to explore the effects of price promotions on primary and secondary demand, and the utility of product assortment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0022","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on economic models of choice and utility maximization without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper we re-examine situations where information asymmetry exists and analyze its effect on the decision of the firm to set a price or delegate pricing responsibility to the salesforce. Using contract theory, we find that when the salesperson's private information can be revealed to the firm through contracting, centralized pricing performs at least as well as price delegation.

Contingent pricing can be useful in mitigating these problems. In contingent pricing arrangements, price is contingent on whether the seller succeeds in obtaining a higher price within a specified period. We show that if the probability of obtaining the high price is not too high, sellers profit from using contingent pricing while economic efficiency increases. The optimal contingent pricing structure depends on the buyer's risk attitude\u2014a deep discount is most profitable if buyers are risk prone. A consolation reward is most profitable if buyers are risk averse. To motivate buyers to participate in a contingent pricing arrangement, the seller must provide sufficient incentives. Consequently, buyers also benefit from contingent pricing. In addition, because the buyers with the highest willingness-to-pay get the product, contingent pricing increases the efficiency of resource allocation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0030","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on contingent pricing strategies to optimize seller profits and economic efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0033","","MKS","Marketing","2","['recommendations', 'consumer response', 'behavioral backlash']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior in response to unsolicited advice, lacking significant engagement with social justice or ethical themes.

It finds that competitor factors explain the most variance in retailer pricing strategy. Only in the cases of price-promotion coordination and relative brand price do category and chain factors explain much variance in retailer pricing. These findings are derived from a simultaneous equation model of how underlying dimensions of retailers' pricing strategies are influenced by variables representing the market, chain, store, category, brand, customer, and competition. The optical scanner data base describes 1,364 brand-store combinations from six categories of consumer packaged goods in five U.S. markets over a two-year time period. Our study classifies retailers' pricing strategies based on four underlying dimensions: price consistency, price-promotion intensity, price-promotion coordination, and relative brand price. These four pricing dimensions are statistically related to: (1) competitor price and deal frequency (competitor factors), (2) storability and necessity (category factors), (3) chain positioning and size (chain factors), (4) store size and assortment (store factors), (5) brand preference and advertising (brand factors), and (6) own-price and deal elasticities (customer factors).

Because advertising policies settle into effective ranges through early trial and error, thresholds cannot be observed directly, and arguments for their existence must be based primarily on a \"statistical footprint,\" that is, on relative fits of a range of model types. To detect possible threshold effects, we formulate a switching regression model with two \"regimes,\" in only one of which advertising is effective. Mediating the switch between the two regimes is a logistic function of category-specific dynamic variables (e.g., order of entry, time in market, number of competitors) and advertising levels, nesting a variety of alternative formulations, among them both standard concave and S-shaped responses. A sequence of comparisons among parametrically related models strongly suggests: that threshold effects exist; that market share response to advertising is not necessarily globally concave; that superior fit cannot be attributed to model flexibility alone; and that dynamic, environmental, competitive, and brand-specific factors can influence advertising effectiveness. These effects are evident in two evolving durables categories (SUVs and minivans), although not in the one mature, nondurable category (liquid detergent) studied.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0035","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and statistical modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While most previous studies have focused on packaged goods sold in grocery stores, we consider durable goods sold through a direct mail catalog. The findings reveal different effects for first-time and established customers. Deeper price discounts in the current period increased future purchases by first-time customers (a positive long-run effect) but reduced future purchases by established customers (a negative long-run effect). Overall, the results show evidence of several long-run effects: forward buying, selection, customer learning, and increased deal sensitivity. Short-run metrics that ignore these effects overstate the overall change in demand for established customers. The implication is that if prices are set based on short-run elasticity, then they will be too low. Among first-time customers, the short-run metrics underestimate the total increase in demand.

Specifically, broadcasters compete by selecting both the \"type\" and quality level of a program to offer, but do not compete on price. We obtain five major results. First, a comparison of monopoly and duopoly markets indicates that broadcasters in an industry with a larger number of competitors may provide programs of lower quality compared to broadcasters in an industry with a smaller number. Second, in terms of viewer welfare, having more channels available is not necessarily \"better.\" Third, broadcasters tend to choose an intermediate level of differentiation in terms of the types of programs they provide, resulting in a \"counterprogramming\" strategy. In other words, avoidance of price competition is not required for competitors to differentiate themselves from each other. Fourth, if one broadcaster starts the evening with a higher-quality (higher-rated) program than its competitor, its second program should also be of higher quality.

Our proposed model also allows habit persistence to be a function of lagged marketing variables, while accommodating the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in household choice parameters. This model is more flexible than existing state-dependence models in marketing and labor econometrics. Using scanner panel data, we find structural state dependence to be the most important source of state dependence. Marketing-mix elasticities are systematically understated if state-dependence effects are incompletely accounted for. The Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998) model is shown to recover spurious variety-seeking effects while overstating habit-persistence effects. Ignoring habit persistence type 1 leads to an underestimation, while ignoring habit persistence type 2 leads to an overestimation of structural state-dependence effects. We find lagged promotions to have carryover effects on habit persistence. Ignoring one or more sources of state dependence underestimates the total incremental impact of a sales promotion.

In this paper, we explore the implications of haggling and fixed prices as pricing policies in a competitive market. We develop a model in which two competing retailers choose between offering either a fixed price or haggling over prices with customers. There are two consumer segments in our analysis. One segment, the hagglers, has a lower opportunity cost of time and a lower haggling cost than the other segment, the nonhagglers. When both retailers follow the same pricing policy, then a haggling policy is more profitable than a fixed-price policy only when the proportion of nonhagglers is sufficiently high. We find two kinds of prisoners' dilemma: under some conditions, a more profitable haggling policy can be broken by a fixed-price policy, and under other conditions, a fixed-price policy can be broken by a haggling policy. Surprisingly, we show that under some conditions, an asymmetric outcome with one retailer haggling and the other offering a fixed price is also an equilibrium.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0045","","MKS","Marketing","2","['haggling', 'pricing policy', 'consumer segments']","The article primarily focuses on pricing strategies and market dynamics without addressing social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Consumers, on the other hand, can use the information service to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the information service from an information service provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any information service. The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing information service for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an information service provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the information service market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide information service. It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0047","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market dynamics and consumer behavior in e-commerce without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

We address three questions. First, what factors affect the attractiveness of each of the four product strategies? Second, under what conditions will any particular strategy dominate the others? Third, what is the impact of licensing fees on the profitability of a licensing strategy? We show that offering a product line utilizes consumer heterogeneity to increase the total user base and is superior to free licensing when the innovator's cost of producing a low-quality product is low and network effects are weak. However, because of the advantage of licensing in generating a larger installed base, free licensing can dominate line extension when network effects are strong, even if the innovator suffers no cost disadvantage compared to the competitor. We also show that paid licensing trumps free licensing when the clone product has a high quality or a low cost, regardless of network effect. Finally, strong network effects make a lump-sum fee more profitable than a royalty fee (or a combination of both) because a royalty fee reduces the licensee's production.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0058","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on product strategies and profitability in markets with network effects, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

With DMLM alone, Rhenania, a German direct mail order company, turned its catalog mailing practices around and consequently rose from the number 5 to the number 2 market position. The DMLM approach was so effective that two major competitors could be bought out. Improvements provided by DMDM were threefold: more efficient resource allocation across all catalog brands, more accurate customer microsegmentation, and more effective reactivation. Presently, the company's target is to transform single-brand customer relationships into two- or three-brand relationships with higher revenue per customer.

Based on their multivariate time-series analysis, the authors demonstrate permanent performance effects of store brand entry, typically benefiting the retailer, the consumers, and premium-brand manufacturers, while harming second-tier brand manufacturers. For the retailer, they consistently find two beneficial effects of store brand entry: high unit margins on the store brand itself and higher unit margins on the national brands. This increase in unit margins implies that the retailer strengthens its bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis national brand manufacturers. However, store brand entry only rarely yields category expansion and does not create store traffic or revenue benefits. Second, consumers do not obtain lower prices on all national brands, only on some second-tier brands. However, they benefit from enlarged product assortment and intensified promotional activity that lowers average price paid for two out of four categories. For the manufacturers, store brand entry is typically beneficial for premium-price national brands, but not for second-tier national brands. Often, premium brands experience lower long-term price sensitivity and higher revenues, whereas second-tier brands experience higher long-term price sensitivity and lower revenues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0036","","MKS","Marketing","2","['store brand', 'performance', 'consumers', 'market players']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of store brand entry and its effects on market dynamics, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper examines the effects of a reduction in such consumer transaction costs caused by market-level technological advances. Using a model in which consumers are simultaneously heterogeneous in their transaction costs and in their marginal valuations of product quality, this paper highlights two mechanisms that can cause such reductions in consumer transaction costs to lower consumer surplus and reduce consumer share of the total social surplus. Specifically, market-level technological advances reduce different consumers' transaction costs by different amounts and increase their reservation prices by different amounts, which can lead to: (i) product design changes that many current consumers do not like and (ii) homogenization in consumer reservation prices that allows a seller to extract more surplus through its pricing policy. This paper also shows that consumers may be better off with seller-induced higher consumer transaction costs. Finally, the paper shows how, depending on the nature of the quality production process, such reductions in consumer transaction costs can either lower or raise product qualities and consumer prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0038","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer welfare', 'transaction costs', 'market-level technological advances']","The article focuses primarily on economic mechanisms and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

This may affect the product line design in general, and which products or services are offered in particular. The problem is that firms have to communicate to consumers, possibly through advertising, to make them consider buying the products that firms are selling. This results in the firm offering a smaller number of products than is optimal when advertising has no costs. This effect is greater the extent of consumer confusion about the advertising messages, and is reduced by a greater ability to target advertising. When offering vertically differentiated products (second-degree price discrimination), under general conditions it is optimal to advertise so that one has a greater proportion of sales of a lower-quality product than if advertising had no cost. This situation also allows the firm to charge a lower price for the high-quality product and offer a higher quality of the low-quality product than it would if advertising were without cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0048","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing and product line design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2004","23","3","Kapil BawaKapil Bawakapil_bawa@baruch.cuny.eduZicklin School of Business, Baruch College, One Baruch Way, New York, New York 10010Search for more papers by this author, Robert ShoemakerRobert Shoemakerrshoemak@stern.nyu.eduStern School of Business, New York University, 44 West 4th St., New York, New York 10012Search for more papers by this author","The Effects of Free Sample Promotions on Incremental Brand Sales","The authors present a model of free sample effects and evidence from two field experiments on free samples.

To address this issue, a static model is developed to examine two settings. The manufacturer uses exclusive distributors in the first setting and nonexclusive distributors in the second. The analysis indicates that the choice of distribution rests critically on whether the manufacturer can effectively extract surplus from the distributors. Due to a variety of institutional reasons, the distributors' liability is often limited in performing on behalf of the manufacturer; such limited liability restricts how much of the distributors' surplus can be extracted. When the distributors' surplus cannot be fully extracted, the manufacturer may prefer nonexclusive distribution even when distributors can free-ride on each other's efforts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0049","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of intrabrand competition and distribution strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2004","23","3","Young-Hoon ParkYoung-Hoon Parkyp34@cornell.eduJohnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, 330 Sage Hall, Ithaca, New York 14853-6201Search for more papers by this author, Peter S.

Using simulations we find that GA and Sequential Search-Based-Nonlinear Least Squares (SSB-NLS) provide comparable parameter estimates when the data including peak sales are being used, for a range of error variances, and true parameter values commonly encountered in the literature. From empirical analyses we find that the forecasting performance of the GA estimates is better than that of SSB-NLS, Augmented Filter, Hierarchical Bayes, and Kalman Filter when only pre-peak sales data is available for estimation. When sales data until the peak time period are available for estimation, SSB-NLS is able to obtain parameter estimates when the starting values provided are the estimates from using GA. The estimates from GA are not biased and do not change in a systematic fashion when post-peak sales data are used, whereas the estimates from SSB-NLS are biased and change in a systematic fashion. Summarizing, we find that GA may be better suited for diffusion model estimation under the three conditions where SSB-NLS has been found to have problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0056","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of genetic algorithms and their application in macro-level diffusion models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To determine whether the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross-period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find that each of these three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0061","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sales promotions and their effects on sales without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Focusing on how to optimally structure such market interactions, I ask whether it is more profitable to restrict individuals to a single bid, as is currently done by Priceline, or conversely, to allow consumers to continue bidding if the previous offer was rejected. I find that both market structures yield the same expected profit. In practice, a single-bid policy may not be perfectly enforceable, especially in the Internet environment, because a sophisticated user can circumvent such a policy by camouflaging one's identity or otherwise manipulating the bidding procedure. Thus, Priceline's single-bid restriction is likely to result in Partial-Repeat-Bidding, the case in which some consumers are limited to a single bid while other, sophisticated users may rebid. I ask whether such surreptitious bidding is detrimental to the NYOP firm and find that profits are lower than if such opportunistic behavior were absent. Surprisingly, I find that the impact of the number of repeat bidders on profits is not monotonic. Thus, if it is prohibitively costly or logistically infeasible for the NYOP firm to eliminate surreptitious rebidding behavior, the firm may, in fact, benefit from encouraging, rather than discouraging, users to rebid. The direction that increases profits depends on the percentage of sophisticated bidders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0062","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on a technical examination of a business model without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

They reach that result through a problematic method to solve the game. Particularly, in the game where the manufacturer accepts returns, they unreasonably assume the retailers would never face stock constraints, thus changing the retail competition from a Cournot-like competition to a Bertrand one. Actually, in a game where retailers first order stocks and then compete by choosing prices, even if a manufacturer offers full return policies, the retailers can still use \u201cinsufficient\u201d stocks as quantities precommitment in order to uphold retail prices. Hence, the retailers still face stock constraints at the final stage of the game. The nature of the game is essentially unaffected by returns policies when demand is certain. This note shows that returns policies do not intensify retail competition in the model proposed by Padmanabhan and Png (1997).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1030.0025","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail competition and returns policies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Moreover, there is increasing skepticism about the importance of contagion and, as has long been known, S-shaped diffusion curves can also result from heterogeneity in the propensity to adopt. We present hypotheses about conditions under which specific contagion mechanisms and income heterogeneity are more pronounced, and test these hypotheses using a meta-analysis of the q/p ratio in applications of the Bass diffusion model. The ratio is positively associated with the Gini index of income inequality in a country, supporting the heterogeneity-in-thresholds interpretation. The ratio also varies as predicted by the Gamma-Shifted Gompertz diffusion model, but the evidence vanishes after controlling for national culture. As to contagion, the q/p ratio varies with the four Hofstede dimensions of national culture\u2014for three of them in a direction consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Furthermore, products with competing standards have a higher q/p ratio, which is again consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Finally, we find effects of national culture only for products without competing standards, suggesting that technological effects and culturally moderated social contagion effects might not operate independently from each other.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0054","","MKS","Marketing","4","['income inequality', 'social contagion', 'national culture']","The article discusses income heterogeneity and its relationship with social contagion, indicating a moderate focus on social issues like income inequality.

Two Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that multicollinearity can cause problems under certain conditions, specifically: (1) when multicollinearity is extreme, Type II error rates are generally unacceptably high (over 80%), (2) when multicollinearity is between 0.6 and 0.8, Type II error rates can be substantial (greater than 50% and frequently above 80%) if composite reliability is weak, explained variance (R2) is low, and sample size is relatively small. However, as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), explained variance R2 reaches 0.75, and sample becomes relatively large, Type II error rates become negligible. (3) When multicollinearity is between 0.4 and 0.5, Type II error rates tend to be quite small, except when reliability is weak, R2 is low, and sample size is small, in which case error rates can still be high (greater than 50%). Methods for detecting and correcting multicollinearity are briefly discussed.

However, there are at least three significant challenges associated with measuring word of mouth. First, how does one gather the data? Because the information is exchanged in private conversations, direct observation traditionally has been difficult. Second, what aspect of these conversations should one measure? The third challenge comes from the fact that word of mouth is not exogenous. While the mapping from word of mouth to future sales is of great interest to the firm, we must also recognize that word of mouth is an outcome of past sales. Our primary objective is to address these challenges. As a context for our study, we have chosen new television (TV) shows during the 1999\u20132000 seasons. Our source of word-of-mouth conversations is Usenet, a collection of thousands of newsgroups with diverse topics. We find that online conversations may offer an easy and cost-effective opportunity to measure word of mouth.

The distribution model postulates separate processes for local market entry by manufacturers, and adoption by retailers given entry. Of special interest is whether retail adoption occurs along a competitive network with retailers as nodes and overlapping trade areas of these retailers as links. The model is calibrated on data covering the introduction of two very successful new brands in the frozen pizza category. For these brands, manufacturers sequentially enter markets based on spatial proximity to markets already entered (spatial evolution), and on whether chains in these markets adopted previously elsewhere (market selection). A retail chain adopts new brands based on the adoption timing of competing chains within its trade territory (competitive contagion) and on the fraction of its trade area in which the new brand is available (trade area coverage). The effects of market selection and of trade area coverage create dependencies between market entry and retail adoption. Because of these dependencies the attraction of a particular market as a lead market depends on its location in the geographic structure of the U.S. retail trade.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0072","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a descriptive model of retail distribution without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion.

However, if product design is a decision variable, lower search costs for price may also lead to higher product differentiation, which decreases price competition. In this case, the overall effect of lower buyer search costs for price may even be higher prices, lower social welfare, and higher industry profits.

Franchisees claim that their revenues have substantially decreased as a result of encroaching same-brand entry. The topic of encroachment has not only dominated franchisee association agendas and trade journal headlines but has also become a hot topic for politicians and policymakers. Yet, until now, evidence of encroachment has been strictly anecdotal. This paper provides the first systematic evidence of encroachment. Using revenue data from the Texas lodging industry in the 1990s, I find that when franchisors approve new same-brand units in the vicinity of incumbent units, these new units cannibalize the incumbents' revenues. In contrast to the result for franchisors, the addition of a new unit by company-owned brands in the vicinity of same-brand units is associated with an increase in the incumbents' revenues. This contrast suggests that encroaching behavior is caused by incentives that result from the governance form of franchising and is not simply an outcome that accompanies all expansion. This finding informs theory on governance forms and exclusive territories. Implications for practitioners and policy are also discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0082","","MKS","Marketing","2","['franchisees', 'encroachment', 'revenues', 'governance']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of territorial encroachment within franchising, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Conventional wisdom also suggests that, all else being equal, retailers will be able to obtain better terms of trade from manufacturers the more substitutable are the manufacturers' products. It follows that retailers should be opposed to advertising that has the effect of reducing cross-price elasticities and thus that manufacturer advertising can be a source of channel conflict. We show that these conventional wisdoms need not hold when only some consumers are exposed to the advertising messages. Using a Hotelling model of demand, we show that (1) manufacturers can be worse off from advertising that reduces the cross-price elasticities between their products, (2) channel conflict need not arise, even when the sole purpose of advertising is to affect cross-price elasticities, and (3) depending on its bargaining power, a retailer can be better off when the manufacturers' products are perceived to be less substitutable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0084","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on conventional marketing strategies and economic models without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that returns policies do increase manufacturer profitability by attenuating retailer price competition when demand is low and intensifying competition when demand is high. Importantly, this effect holds only in the presence of demand uncertainty. Further, the conditions under which a returns policy raises the manufacturer's profit are weaker when retailing is a duopoly than when retailing is a monopoly.

Yet most revenue management methodologies ignore this phenomenon\u2014or at best approximate it in a heuristic way. In this paper, we provide an exact and quite general analysis of this problem. Specifically, we analyze a single-leg reserve management problem in which the buyers' choice behavior is modeled explicitly. The choice model is very general, simply specifying the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered. The control problem is to decide which subset of fare products to offer at each point in time. We show that the optimal policy for this problem has a quite simple form. Namely, it consists of identifying an ordered family of \u201cefficient\u201c subsets S1, \u2026, Sm, and at each point in time opening one of these sets Sk, where the optimal index k is increasing in the remaining capacity x and decreasing in the remaining time. That is, the more capacity (or less time) available, the further the optimal set is along this sequence. We also show that the optimal policy is a nested allocation policy if and only if the sequence of efficient sets is nested, that is S1 \u2286 S2 \u2286 \u2026 \u2286Sm. Moreover, we give a characterization of when nesting by fare order is optimal. We also develop an estimation procedure for this setting based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method that jointly estimates arrival rates and choice model parameters when no-purchase outcomes are unobservable. Numerical results are given to illustrate both the model and estimation procedure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0147","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and consumer choice behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product.

Product demands in each period are integer-valued correlated random variables, with each product being assembled from multiple units of a subset of components. The system quotes a prespecified response time window for each product and receives a reward if the demand for that product is filled within its response time window. We formulate a two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse to determine the optimal base-stock policy and the optimal component allocation policy for the ATO system. We show that the component allocation problem is a general multidimensional knapsack problem (MDKP) and is NP-hard. We propose a simple, order-based component allocation rule and show that it can be solved in either polynomial or pseudopolynomial time.

In this paper we show that, under such a contract, both the overall channel performance and the performance of individual firms depend critically on demand price elasticity and on the retailer's share of channel cost. In particular, the (expected) channel profit loss, compared with that of a centralized system, increases with demand price elasticity and decreases with retailer's cost share, while the profit share extracted by the retailer decreases with price elasticity and increases with retailer's cost share. With an iso-price-elastic demand model, we show that the channel profit loss cannot exceed 26.4%, and that the retailer's profit share cannot be below 50%. When price elasticity is low, or when the retailer's cost share approaches 100%, or both, the retailer can extract nearly all the channel profit that is almost equal to the centralized channel profit.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0168","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of channel performance and profit-sharing mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop models and solution procedures to determine the optimal allocation of demand to facilities and the optimal inventory level for products at each facility. We consider two types of demand allocation, one in which we allow the demand for a product to be split among multiple facilities and the other in which demand from each product must be entirely satisfied by a single facility. We also consider two forms of inventory warehousing, one in which inventory locations are factory based and one in which they are centralized. For each case, we offer a solution procedure to obtain optimal demand allocations and optimal inventory base-stock levels. For systems with multiple customer classes, we also determine optimal inventory rationing levels for each class for each product.

We show that group market share has an inverted-U impact on innovation in industrial sectors of both Korea and Taiwan during the 1981\u20131995 period.

Learning in such settings poses the challenge of credit assignment (Minsky 1961), that is, how to assign credit for the overall outcome of a sequence of actions to each of the antecedent actions. To explore the process of learning in such contexts, we create a formal model in which the actors develop a mental model of the value of stage-setting actions as a complex problem-solving task is repeated. Partial knowledge, either of particular states in the problem space or inefficient and circuitous routines through the space, is shown to be quite valuable. Because of the interdependence of intelligent action when a sequence of actions must be identified, however, organizational knowledge is relatively fragile. As a consequence, while turnover may stimulate search and have largely benign implications in less interdependent task settings, it is very destructive of the organization's near-term performance when the learning problem requires a complementarity among the actors' knowledge.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0271","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational learning and credit assignment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There are two fundamental strategies to manage innovation with unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity: trial and error learning and selectionism. Trial and error learning involves a flexible (unplanned) adjustment of the considered actions and targets to new information about the relevant environment as it emerges. Selectionism involves pursuing several approaches independently of one another and picking the best one ex post. Neither strategy nor project management literatures have compared the relative advantages of the two approaches in the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity. We build a model of a complex project with unforeseeable uncertainty, simulating problem solving as a local search on a rugged landscape. We compare the project payoff performance under trial and error learning and selectionism, based on a priori identifiable project characteristics: whether unforeseeable uncertainty is present, how high the complexity is, and how much trial and error learning and parallel trials cost. We find that if unforeseeable uncertainty is present and the team cannot run trials in a realistic user environment (indicating the project's true market performance), trial and error learning is preferred over selectionism. Moreover, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty can reverse an established result from computational optimization: Without unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal number of parallel trials increases in complexity. But with unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal number of trials might decrease because the unforeseeable factors make the trials less and less informative as complexity grows.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0274","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['uncertainty', 'complexity', 'innovation']","The article primarily focuses on technical strategies for managing innovation under uncertainty and complexity, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Attention is focused on the M/M/s/r + M model, having a Poisson arrival process, exponential service times, s servers, r extra waiting spaces, exponential abandon times (the final +M), and the first-come\u2013first-served service discipline. Both the number of servers and the arrival rate are allowed to increase, while the individual service and abandonment rates are held fixed. The key is how the two limits are related: In the now common quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) or Halfin-Whitt limiting regime, the probability of initially being delayed approaches a limit strictly between 0 and 1, while the probability of eventually being served (not abandoning) approaches 1. In contrast, in the ED limiting regime, the probability of eventually being served approaches a limit strictly between 0 and 1, while the probability of initially being delayed approaches 1. To obtain the ED regime, it suffices to let the arrival rate and the number of servers increase with the traffic intensity \u03c1 held fixed with \u03c1 > 1 (so that the arrival rate exceeds the maximum possible service rate). The ED regime can be realistic because with the abandonments, the delays need not be extraordinarily large. When the ED appropriations are appropriate, they are appealing because they are remarkably simple.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0279","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service-oriented call centers without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that jump bidding is more likely earlier in an auction, when jumping has a larger strategic value, and that the incentives to jump bid increase as competition increases.

Using data on all recalls experienced by automakers that sold passenger cars in the United States during the 1966\u20131999 period, we follow the learning-curve tradition in investigating the effects of voluntary and involuntary recalls on subsequent recall rates. We find that voluntary recalls result in more learning than mandated recalls when learning is measured as a reduction in subsequent involuntary recalls. This effect is at least partly because of shallower learning processes that result from involuntary recalls. The effect of volition, however, is different for generalist and specialist automakers. The results of this study suggest an important, yet understudied, determinant of the rate and effectiveness of learning\u2014volition. The results also add to our knowledge of the different learning processes of generalist and specialist organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0219","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['volition', 'learning', 'mandates']","The article primarily focuses on organizational learning and the impact of volition versus mandates in the context of product recalls, with no strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that firms with more units that scan areas of opportunity are more likely to enter a market, while firms with more units that scan nonfocal areas are less likely to enter the market. We also find that personnel links between units and the corporate level of the firm often constrain entry to new markets by dampening a unit's appetite for risk. Personnel links between operating units, on the other hand, can make a firm more likely to enter new markets, particularly when the cooperating units combine different sets of information.

At the manufacturing plant level, we focus on three repositories of knowledge that drive performance. First, the physical production or information systems represent knowledge embedded in the plant's technical systems. Second, the plant's workforce has knowledge, including diverse scientific information and skills, to effectively operate the technical systems. Third, the firm's managerial systems embody knowledge in the form of goals, reward systems, and control and coordination systems. Taken together, we consider the technical systems, workforce knowledge, and the managerial systems as the plant's knowledge-based resource capability. Two normative models are introduced offering insight on how plant performance is impacted by investments in workforce knowledge (training) or the technical systems (process change). The models explicitly recognize that the outcome of investments in knowledge-based change is uncertain due to factors including technical problems, worker resistance, and limited financial resources. Also, we recognize that workforce knowledge may be deployed to mitigate the outcome uncertainty encountered with process change. Investments in knowledge-based change cannot be fully understood in isolation of the managerial systems. In one model, the plant manager is motivated by an incentive system that rewards the realization of a threshold goal, whereas in the other model the incentive system emphasizes the realization of meeting a particular target goal. We also investigate the impact of the manager's view of uncertainty (her willingness to absorb risk), which is influenced by the managerial systems. Results show that different characterizations of the managerial systems have a profound effect on managerial behavior and plant-level performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0234","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['workforce', 'knowledge', 'managerial systems']","The article discusses the importance of workforce knowledge and managerial systems, which hints at considerations of employee development and organizational behavior.

Findings suggest that teams with initially distributed expertise and familiar members are more likely to develop a TMS. Frequent face-to-face communication also led to TMS emergence, but communication via other means had no effect. Teams with more established TMSs later benefited from face-to-face communication, but they were less helped by frequent communication via other means, suggesting that transactive retrieval processes may have been triggered during face-to-face communication and suppressed during other types of communication.

Further, the franchisor's local experience reduced failure rates. Contrary to one hypothesis, franchisors' distant experience did not prove beneficial.

Making use of a dynamic fixed-effects distributed lag regression model, we empirically assess the role that two central components of pharmaceutical marketing practices (namely, detailing and sampling) have on physician prescribing behavior. Key differentiating features of our model include its ability to (i) capture persistence in the prescribing process and decompose it into own-growth and competitive-stealing effects, (ii) estimate an unrestricted decay structure of the promotional effects over time, and (iii) control for physician-specific effects that, if not taken into account, induce biased coefficient estimates of detailing and sampling effects. Based on pooled time series cross-sectional data involving three drugs, 24 monthly observations, and 74,075 individual physicians (more than 2 million observations in total), we find that detailing and free drug samples have positive and statistically significant effects on the number of new prescriptions issued by a physician.

Conversely, others claim that advertising serves a purely informational role. Here, higher levels of advertising lead to better-informed consumers and this should increase competition and stimulate lower prices. The objective of this study is to neither confirm nor refute either of these perspectives. It is rather to show that increases in informative advertising alone can lead to both higher or lower prices. I further show that the direction of this relationship depends on the level of differentiation between competing firms. Similar to Grossman and Shapiro (1984), I examine conditions where the differences between competing products are small, but I also examine conditions where the differences are significant. The role of advertising is to inform consumers about individual products and higher advertising for a product means that more of the potential market knows about it. Higher levels of advertising increase the relative importance of fully informed consumers compared to partially informed consumers. This dynamic is the basis for explaining why informative advertising can push prices either up or down in a uniformly distributed spatial market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0288","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['informative', 'advertising', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of advertising and consumer information without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our research integrates these viewpoints with a structured approach to study how design interfaces in the product architecture map onto communication patterns within the development organization. We investigate how organizational and system boundaries, design interface strength, indirect interactions, and system modularity impact the alignment of design interfaces and team interactions. We hypothesize and test how these factors explain the existence of the following cases: (1) known design interfaces not addressed by team interactions, and (2) observed team interactions not predicted by design interfaces. Our results offer important insights to managers dealing with interdependences across organizational and functional boundaries.

It is shown that offering fixed-fee pricing in addition to a nonlinear usage-based pricing scheme is always profit improving in the presence of nonzero transaction costs, and there may be markets in which a pure fixed-fee is optimal. This implies that the optimal pricing strategy for information goods is almost never fully revealing. Moreover, it is proved that the optimal usage-based pricing schedule is independent of the value of the fixed fee, a result that simplifies the simultaneous design of pricing schedules considerably and provides a simple procedure for determining the optimal combination of fixed-fee and nonlinear usage-based pricing. The introduction of fixed-fee pricing is shown to increase both consumer surplus and total surplus. The differential effects of setup costs, fixed transaction costs, and variable transaction costs on pricing policy are described. These results suggest a number of managerial guidelines for designing pricing schedules. For instance, in nascent information markets, firms may profit from low fixed-fee penetration pricing, but as these markets mature, the optimal pricing mix should expand to include a wider range of usage-based pricing options. Minimum fees, quantity discounts, and adoption levels across the different pricing schemes are characterized, strategic pricing responses to changes in market characteristics are described, and the implications of the paper's results for bundling and vertical differentiation of information goods are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0291","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies for information goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show, however, that if the objective function depends only on the maximum travel time, this \u201cnew\u201d model is essentially the same as the classical model that ignores the transient times. Our result implies that two of the three versions of the latest arrival hub location problem proposed by Kara and Tansel, including the one to which they devote most of their paper, are equivalent to their classical counterparts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0312","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in cargo delivery modeling without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

When component suppliers have random capacity and end-product demand is uncertain, we characterize the system's inventory dynamics. We show that components and the end product play convex complementary roles in providing customer service. We propose a decomposition approach that uses an internal service level to independently determine near-optimal stock levels for each component. Compared with the optimal, the average error of the decomposition approach is 0.66% across the tested instances. Compared with current practice, this approach has the potential to reduce the safety-stock cost by as much as 30%. Our computational analysis on two-echelon systems also illustrates several managerial insights: We observe that the cost reduction from improving supply performance is high when demand variability or the number of components or target customer service is high, or when the end product is more expensive relative to components. On average, (i) reducing the lead time of the more expensive component yielded higher benefit than reducing the lead time for the less expensive component, and (ii) the benefit of improving one of the supply parameters (service level or lead time) was higher when the value of the other parameter was already more favorable (lower lead time or higher service level, respectively). Finally, we analytically show how a multi-echelon pure assembly system may be converted into an equivalent two-echelon assembly system to which all our results apply.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0314","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and supply performance without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One of the most computationally useful ideas of the 1970s is the observation that many hard integer programming problems can be viewed as easy problems complicated by a relatively small set of side constraints. Dualizing the side constraints produces a Lagrangian problem that is easy to solve and whose optimal value is a lower bound (for minimization problems) on the optimal value of the original problem. The Lagrangian problem can thus be used in place of a linear programming relaxation to provide bounds in a branch and bound algorithm. This approach has led to dramatically improved algorithms for a number of important problems in the areas of routing, location, scheduling, assignment and set covering. This paper is a review of Lagrangian relaxation based on what has been learned in the last decade.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0263","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to solving integer programming problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2004","50","12_supplement","Frank M.

Consider a series of companies in a supply chain, each of whom orders from its immediate upstream member. In this setting, inbound orders from a downstream member serve as a valuable informational input to upstream production and inventory decisions. This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of \u201corders\u201d tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and distortion tends to increase as one moves upstream\u2014a phenomenon termed \u201cbullwhip effect.\u201d This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations.

A manager tries to put together the various resources under his control into an activity that achieves his objectives. A model of his operation can assist him but probably will not unless it meets certain requirements. A model that is to be used by a manager should be simple, robust, easy to control, adaptive, as complete as possible, and easy to communicate with. By simple is meant easy to understand; by robust, hard to get absurd answers from; by easy to control, that the user knows what input data would be required to produce desired output answers; adaptive means that the model can be adjusted as new information is acquired; completeness implies that important phenomena will be included even if they require judgmental estimates of their effect; and, finally, easy to communicate with means that the manager can quickly and easily change inputs and obtain and understand the outputs. Such a model consists of a set of numerical procedures for processing data and judgments to assist managerial decision making and so will be called a decision calculus. An example from marketing is described. It is an on-line model for use by product managers on advertising budgeting questions. The model is currently in trial use by several product managers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0267","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The Basic Model","(This article originally appeared in Management Science, November 1967, Volume 14, Number 3, pp. 159\u2013182, published by The Institute of Management Sciences.) The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities. In most of the paper it is assumed that these probability distributions entertained by the different players are mutually \u201cconsistent,\u201d in the sense that they can be regarded as conditional probability distributions derived from a certain \u201cbasic probability distribution\u201d over the parameters unknown to the various players. But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption. In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probability distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the \u201cbasic probability distribution\u201d governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield \u201cBayesian equilibrium points\u201d for the original game. Finally, Part III considers the main properties of the \u201cbasic probability distribution.\u201d","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0270","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of game theory without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The overview starts by tracing the trends and ideas of the 1960s into the 1970s. The 1970s blend easily into the era of decision support systems (DSS). Starting late in the decade and still continuing, DSSs have evolved rapidly due to an explosion of data, increased computer power, and advances in modeling methods. I review highlights of this evolution from the point of view of managerial models, giving special emphasis to marketing, since that has been my window on this world. The good news is that more managers than ever are using models. The bad news is that many managers do not even realize they are using models! (But we should ask whether this is really bad.)

Findings include (1) the need for an insurmountable gap in performance to stimulate the decision to reuse others' knowledge; (2) the critical importance of an adapter to bridge the idea source and recipient; (3) three layers of search-and-evaluate activities in which the first layer of scanning to find ideas to reuse and the last layer of detailed analysis of ideas are bridged by a layer of brief evaluations of ideas assessing the presence (or absence) of targeted information about each idea; and (4) the differential use of metaknowledge about each idea to facilitate proceeding through each search-and-evaluate layer. In addition, reusers in the more (versus less) innovative cases redefined problems at the outset in nontraditional ways using analogies and extensions, rather than accepting the preexisting problem definition; used a substantially broader search strategy with a greater variety of search methods; and worked more closely with adapters during the latter stages of the reuse process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0116","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['innovation', 'knowledge reuse', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on the technical process of knowledge reuse in the context of innovation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, little attention has been paid to the problem of identifying what constitutes an appropriate  modularization of a complex system. We develop a formal simulation model that allows us to carefully examine the dynamics of innovation and performance in complex systems. The model points to the trade-off between the destabilizing effects of overly refined modularization and the modest levels of search and a premature fixation on inferior designs that can result from excessive levels of integration. The analysis highlights an asymmetry in this trade-off, with excessively refined modules leading to cycling behavior and a lack of performance improvement.

Other costs incurred include ordering costs associated with each replenishment and holding costs related to capital tied up in inventory and physical stock holding. The net present value (NPV) principle is applied. Explicit expressions for the development of the optimal order quantities over time are presented. It is shown that three cases may be distinguished: (i) when the price change is very small, (ii) when an essential price increase occurs, and (iii) when there is an essential price decrease. Although the optimal last-order quantity before a price increase is similar in magnitude to what has been presented in other articles applying average cost approaches, in certain respects, this paper offers novel results contradictory to those suggested by other authors. Analysis shows that the average-cost model solutions are first-order approximations in the discount rate. Numerical evaluations of a range of price increases and times to the price increase suggest that, with certain important caveats, the average-cost formulae are likely to be acceptable for most practical situations for the infinite horizon situation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0150","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These shopbots automatically search a large number of vendors for price and availability. Typically a shopbot searches a predefined set of vendors and reports all results, which can result in time-consuming searches that provide redundant or dominated alternatives. Our research demonstrates analytically how shopbot designs can be improved by developing a utility model of consumer purchasing behavior. This utility model considers the intrinsic value of the product and its attributes, the disutility from waiting, and the cognitive costs associated with evaluating the offers retrieved. We focus on the operational decisions made by the shopbot: which stores to search, how long to wait, and which offers to present to the user.

As customers are frequently unable to accurately articulate their needs, designers typically create one or several prototypes, which they then present to the customer. This process, which we call collaborative prototyping, allows both parties to anticipate the outcome of the design process. Prototypes have two advantages: They help the customer to evaluate the unknown customized product, and they guide both parties in the search for the ideal product specification. Collaborative prototyping involves two economic agents, with different information structures and different\u2014and potentially conflicting\u2014objective functions. This raises several interesting questions: how many prototypes should be built, who should pay for them, and how should they and the customized product be priced. We show that, depending on the design problem and the market characteristics, the designer should offer prototypes at a profit, at cost, or even for free.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0178","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of collaborative prototyping and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we address the problem of choosing the appropriate reverse channel structure for the collection of used products from customers. Specifically, we consider a manufacturer who has three options for collecting such products: (1) she can collect them herself directly from the customers, (2) she can provide suitable incentives to an existing retailer (who already has a distribution channel) to induce the collection, or (3) she can subcontract the collection activity to a third party. Based on our observations in the industry, we model the three options described above as decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. When considering decentralized channels, we find that ceteris paribus, the agent, who is closer to the customer (i.e., the retailer), is the most effective undertaker of product collection activity for the manufacturer. In addition, we show that simple coordination mechanisms can be designed such that the collection effort of the retailer and the supply chain profits are attained at the same level as in a centrally coordinated system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0186","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['remanufacturing', 'sustainability', 'reverse channel']","The article discusses remanufacturing and supply chain structures, which touches on sustainability themes; however, it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity.

With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain's inventory risk. A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain's inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain's profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of implementing coordinating contracts (i.e., contracts that achieve 100% efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinating contracts are compared against an inappropriate benchmark (often just a push contract). Furthermore, if firms also consider advance-purchase discounts, which are also simple to administer, then the coordination of the supply chain and the arbitrary allocation of its profit is possible. Several limitations of advance-purchase discounts are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0190","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory risk allocation and supply chain efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper argues that the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse.

However, for influence diagrams having many variables, the state space of all variables grows exponentially, and the sample sizes required for good estimates may be too large to be practical. In this paper, we develop a MMC method, which samples only a small set of chance variables for each decision node in the influence diagram. MMC is akin to methods developed for exact solution of influence diagrams in that we limit the number of chance variables sampled at any time.

The formulation of the constraints is general and can be extended to different personnel management problems where staff members must cover shifts, and management must assign a fixed number of days off per week. The model maximizes staff satisfaction, expressed by positive weights for pairs of shifts in consecutive days. We consider the associated polytope and study its structure, determining some classes of inequalities that are facet inducing for special subproblems and other valid classes. We also identify a particular subproblem whose solution can be used to determine strong cuts for the complete problem. In addition, we design special branching rules that break the symmetries that arise in the solution space and have a large impact in the efficiency of the method. The validity of this approach has been ascertained by extensive computational tests; moreover, the operations research (OR) department of an airline has implemented the method to solve ground staff management problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0142","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['staff satisfaction', 'workload balancing', 'shift compatibility']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of staff scheduling and operational efficiency, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Firms are assumed to reorganize workplaces if the productivity gains arising from workplace reorganization exceed the associated reorganization costs. Two different types of organizational change are considered: enhancement group work and flattening of hierarchies. Empirical evidence is provided for a sample of 411 firms from the German business-related services sector. We develop and estimate a model for labor productivity and firms' decision to reorganize workplaces that allows workplace reorganization to affect any parameter of the labor productivity equation. Our general and flexible methodology allows us to properly take account of strategic complementarities between the input factors and workplace reorganization. The estimation results show that changes in human resources practices do not significantly affect firms' output elasticities with respect to ICT, non-ICT capital, and labor, although most of the point estimates of the individual output elasticities and of the control variables for observable firm heterogeneity are larger if workplace reorganization is realized. We therefore apply the Kernel density-estimation technique and demonstrate that for firms with organizational change, the entire labor productivity distribution shifts significantly out to the right if workplace reorganization takes place, indicating that workplace reorganization induces an increase in labor productivity that is attributable to complementarities between the various input factors and workplace reorganization. By contrast, firms without organizational change would not have realized significant productivity gains if they had reorganized workplaces.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0195","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['organizational change', 'workplace reorganization', 'human resources']","The article primarily focuses on productivity and organizational change without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This significant simplification provides the first general, closed-form condition for commonality adoption and identifies its value drivers. Commonality is optimal even for perfectly correlated demands if products have sufficiently different margins.

We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying online buyer behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0153","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for predicting customer behavior in e-commerce without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By analyzing panel data from over 10,000 Internet households and three commodity-like products (books, compact discs (CDs), and air travel services), we show that the amount of online search is actually quite limited. On average, households visit only 1.2 book sites, 1.3 CD sites, and 1.8 travel sites during a typical active month in each category. Using probabilistic models, we characterize search behavior at the individual level in terms of (1) depth of search, (2) dynamics of search, and (3) activity of search. We model an individual's tendency to search as a logarithmic process, finding that shoppers search across very few sites in a given shopping month. We extend the logarithmic model of search to allow for time-varying dynamics that may cause the consumer to evolve and, perhaps, learn to search over time. We find that for two of the three product categories studied, search propensity does not change from month to month. However, in the third product category we find mild evidence of time-varying dynamics, where search decreases over time from already low levels. Finally, we model the level of a household's shopping activity and integrate it into our model of search. The results suggest that more-active online shoppers tend also to search across more sites. This consumer characteristic largely drives the dynamics of search that can easily be mistaken as increases from experience at the individual level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0194","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online search behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We explicitly model market demand uncertainty, a firm's internal cost structure, and competition, using an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on a large-scale numerical analysis, we find that more frequent new-product introductions are optimal under faster clockspeed conditions. In addition, we find that a firm's optimal product-quality decision is governed by a firm's relative costs of introducing new products with incremental versus more substantial improvements. We show that a time-pacing product introduction strategy results in a production policy with a simple base-stock form and performs well relative to the optimal policy. Our results thus provide analytical support for the managerial belief that industry clockspeed and time to market are closely related.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0172","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of new-product strategy and industry dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We use the bilateral monopoly setting to analyze six scenarios: three increasingly general contracts (wholesale-pricing schemes, two-part linear schemes, and twopart nonlinear schemes), each under full and incomplete information about the buyer's cost structure. We allow both sides to refuse to trade by explicitly including reservation profit levels for both; for the supplier, this is implemented through a cutoff policy. We derive the supplier's optimal contracts and profits for all six scenarios and examine the value of information and of more general contracts. Our key findings are as follows: First, the value of information is higher under two-part contracts; second, the value of offering two-part contracts is higher under full information; and third, the proportion of buyers the supplier will choose to exclude can be substantial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0173","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply contracts and information asymmetry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Transfer of inventory monitoring and other overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers might be interested in VMI. We show that VMI intensifies the competition between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch to another brand if their \u201cpreferred\u201d brand is out of stock. The manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand, not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock. When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMI restores the competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0174","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In these service industries, firms face demand uncertainty and strict short-term capacity constraint. When the market demand is low, firms hold excess capacities that would lead to intense price competition. In this paper we study the adoption and design of reward programs in the context of capacity management. We demonstrate that it is optimal for firms to offer capacity rewards when the market demand varies from one period to the other. By offering the reward programs, firms can effectively reduce available capacities when the market demand is low, and hence credibly show their unwillingness to undersell. Such a commitment can encourage their competitors to set their prices high. When firms provide reward programs, if a firm sets a higher price than the other and sells less today, in the future the firm can benefit from the other firm's larger reduction in available capacity through rewards. Thus, reward programs also provide additional incentives for firms to set higher current prices. Finally, since reward programs can add flexibility in adjusting the available capacities to the market demand, firms increase the size of regular capacities with reward programs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0175","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity management and reward programs without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These managers bargain with each other before arriving at compromise decisions regarding price and quality.

This paper develops a conceptual framework that relates information-integration initiatives to manufacturer profitability. The framework allows such initiatives to impact inventory management and revenue-enhancing measures that, in turn, increase manufacturer profit margins, or affect profit margins directly. Through an extensive survey in the food and consumer packaged goods industry, we empirically examine this framework. The analysis reveals that the various integration techniques are differentially associated with manufacturer performance. Collaborative planning on replenishment, in the form of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is directly and positively related to manufacturer margins, while collaboration on new products and services is positively related to intermediate performance measures. Specifically, this latter form of collaboration allows the manufacturer to charge higher wholesale prices and, interestingly, is associated with lower retailer, and consequently manufacturer, stockouts. In contrast, collaboration on the handling of excess and defective retailer inventory (i.e., reverse logistics) results in higher manufacturer stockout levels, on average. Solely sharing information on either inventory levels or customer needs is associated with higher manufacturer performance measures up to a certain point; sharing this information is prevalent among manufacturers that achieve industry-average profitability relative to those that achieve below industry-average profitability. The paper explains these results in the context of the conceptual framework developed and discusses the managerial implications for effective coordination between supply chain partners.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0182","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['information integration', 'collaboration', 'supply chain']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance and profitability, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

A market share model is developed to capture (1) the impact of delivery-time commitment and delivery quality on the firm's market share and (2) the impact of the firm's market share and process variability on delivery quality when there is a congestion effect. We show that the choice of the delivery-time commitment requires a proper balance between the level of service capacity and customer sensitivities to delivery-time expectation and delivery quality.

In the case of the manufacturer being a price setter, we characterize the Stackelberg game that arises, and provide several insights into how the game dynamics are affected by transshipments. Specifically, we find that risk pooling makes retailers\u2019 order quantities less sensitive to the wholesale price set by the manufacturer; hence, in general, the manufacturer benefits from retailers\u2019 transshipments by charging a higher wholesale price, while retailers are often worse off.

In these contexts the resource was assumed to exhibit complete flexibility. This research explores the extent to which the operational benefits associated with resource flexibility can be achieved in a flow shop environment using a partially flexible resource. Focusing on labor flexibility, we propose corresponding metrics for partial flexibility and formulate a model for flow shop scheduling with partial resource flexibility. On the basis of computational experiments, we explore properties pertaining to the relative amounts as well as the allocation of partial resource flexibility as it is distributed across the workforce. The conclusions drawn from this research provide significant insight into the management of flow shops with a workforce that is crosstrained to achieve partial flexibility.

Which brand, category, and market conditions influence promotional benefits and their allocation across manufacturers and retailers? To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale econometric investigation of the effects of price promotions on manufacturer revenues, retailer revenues, and total profits (margins). A first major finding is that a price promotion typically does not have permanent monetary effects for either party. Second, price promotions have a predominantly positive impact on manufacturer revenues, but their effects on retailer revenues are mixed. Moreover, retailer category margins are typically reduced by price promotions. Even when accounting for cross-category and store-traffic effects, we still find evidence that price promotions are typically not beneficial to the retailer. Third, our results indicate that manufacturer revenue elasticities are higher for promotions of small-share brands, for frequently promoted brands and for national brands in impulse product categories with a low degree of brand proliferation and low private-label shares. Retailer revenue elasticities are higher for brands with frequent and shallow promotions, for impulse products, and in categories with a low degree of brand proliferation. Finally, retailer margin elasticities are higher for promotions of small-share brands and for brands with infrequent and shallow promotions.

We specify an individual-level discrete-choice model of demand and derive the supply side assuming manufacturers compete in prices. The proposed estimation method considers price endogeneity through simultaneous estimation of demand and supply, allows for consumer heterogeneity, and incorporates a pricing rule consistent with economic theory. The basic idea behind the proposed estimation procedure is to simulate prices and choice probabilities by solving for the market equilibrium. By repeating this many times, we obtain an empirical distribution of equilibrium prices and probabilities. The empirical distribution is then smoothed and used in a likelihood procedure to estimate the parameters of the model. The advantage of this method is that it avoids the need to perform a transformation of variables. If the tastes of consumers are independent across market periods, our approach yields maximum likelihood estimates; otherwise, it yields consistent but not fully efficient partial likelihood estimates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0227","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for estimating market models without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For products having demand rates that increase with inventory levels, we analyze the effect of stocking decisions on firm profitability to develop managerial insights regarding the structure of the optimal inventory policy, and to understand how this policy differs from traditional approaches. When inventories stimulate demand, iteratively applying the standard economic order quantity (EOQ) model\u2013by setting the demand rate parameter equal to the observed average demand rate in prior cycles\u2013yields an equilibrium order quantity that is robust to demand parameter misestimation, but is suboptimal. The profit-maximizing policy orders larger quantities, and can replenish inventory even before on-hand stock fully depletes. Using an extension of a standard inventory-dependent demand model from the literature, we first provide a convenient characterization of products that require early replenishment. We demonstrate that the optimal cycle time is largely governed by the conventional trade-off between ordering and holding costs, whereas the reorder point relates to a promotions-oriented cost-benefit perspective. We show that the optimal policy yields significantly higher profits than cost-based inventory policies, underscoring the importance of profit-driven inventory management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0228","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on inventory management and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A common type of outcome prediction is binary or discrete outcome prediction, as found in medical diagnosis and firm bankruptcy prediction. The prediction problem studied in this paper is outcome time prediction, or prognosis. Prognosis in medicine refers to a prediction of probable outcome of a disease for a patient. Patient data used as the basis for disease prognosis are usually censored because some of the patients have not experienced the outcome of the disease at the time of prognosis. A mathematical-programming approach, called isotonic prediction, is developed for the purpose of such prognosis tasks. The proposed technique is different from well-known statistical survival analysis methods, such as Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation and Cox's regression, in that it predicts individual patients' survival time frame.

Most airlines also depend on voluntary and involuntary flying by regular crews to cover trips that fall out of work schedules due to conflicts and disruptions (open time trips). These open time trips, combined with expected levels of voluntary and involuntary flying, affect reserve staffing levels; airlines must plan crew staffing in advance to meet resulting training and new-hire requirements.

We formulate a model of capacity expansion for uncertain exponential demand growth and deterministic expansion lead times when there is an obligation to provide a specified level of service. The service level, defined in terms of the ratio of expected lead-time shortage to installed capacity, is guaranteed by timing each expansion to begin when demand reaches a fixed proportion of the capacity position. Under this timing rule, the optimal facilities to install can be determined by solving an equivalent deterministic problem without lead times. Numerical results show the effects of the demand parameters and lead-time length on the expansion timing. The interaction of timing with expansion size is explored for the case when continuous facility sizes are available with economies of scale.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0187","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity expansion and demand management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A general model of knowledge sourcing, including contextual and dispositional antecedents and learning outcomes, is proposed and validated using survey data from a global organization. Knowledge sourcing explains a significant proportion of individuals' learning outcomes, but the strength of this effect is moderated both by the strength of individuals' learning orientations and the degree to which they find their jobs to be intellectually demanding.

In this paper, we investigate how best to apply a new branch-and-cut quadratic programming algorithm to solve the pooling problem. To this effect, we consider two standard models: One is based primarily on flow variables, and the other relies on the proportion of flows entering pools. A hybrid of these two models is proposed for general pooling problems. Comparison of the computational properties of flow and proportion models is made on several problem instances taken from the literature.

In particular, for variations of the objective function coefficients, the approach gives a maximum-tolerance percentage within which selected coefficients may vary from their estimated values (within a priori limits) while still retaining the same optimal basic feasible solution. Although an optimal solution may cease being optimal for variations beyond the maximum-tolerance percentage, it may still be close to optimal.

This paper examines the conditions under which firms expand their own portfolios of patents in response to potential hold-up problems in markets for technology. Combining insights from transactions cost theory with recent scholarship on intellectual property and its exchange, I predict firms will patent more aggressively than otherwise expected when markets for technology are highly fragmented (i.e., ownership rights to external technologies are widely distributed); this effect should be more pronounced for firms with large investments in technology-specific assets and under a strong legal appropriability regime. Although these characteristics of firms and their external environments have been highlighted in the theoretical literature, prior research has not explored the extent to which such factors interact to shape the patenting behavior of firms. To empirically test these hypotheses, I develop a citations-based \u201cfragmentation index\u201d and estimate the determinants of patenting for 67 U.S. semiconductor firms between 1980 and 1994.

Firms that adopt a science-oriented research approach (i.e., \u201cscience\u201d) allow their researchers to pursue and publish an individual research agenda. The adoption of science may be associated with a \u201ctaste\u201d for science on the part of researchers (a preference effect) and/or as a \u201cticket of admission\u201d to gain earlier access to scientific discoveries with commercial application (a productivity effect). These two effects differ in their impact on wages. Whereas the preference effect contributes to a negative compensating differential, the productivity effect may result in rent sharing. However, because science may be adopted by firms employing higher-quality researchers, cross-sectional evaluations of wages and science may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity. To overcome this bias, this paper introduces a novel empirical approach. Specifically, prior to accepting a given job, many scientists receive multiple job offers, allowing for the calculation of the wage-science relationship and controlling for differences in salary levels offered to individual researchers. Using a dataset composed of multiple job offers to postdoctoral biologists, the results suggest a negative relationship between wages and science. These findings are robust to restricting the sample to nonacademic job offers, but the findings depend critically on the inclusion of researcher fixed effects.

A Cournot model in which costs follow a random walk shows that such a process could produce evidence of substantial persistence of profitability. The results suggest that persistent profitability does not necessarily provide strong evidence for systematic a priori differences among firms. Nevertheless, since the phenomenon of long leads is highly unrepresentative of intuitive notions of random sequences, such evidence may still be persuasive.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0143","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of strategy and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose a generalized delay cost structure that augments the standard additive model with a multiplicative component, capturing the interdependence between delay cost and values. We derive and compare the revenue-maximizing and socially optimal equilibria under uniform pricing, preemptive, and nonpreemptive priority auctions with an admission price. We find that the delay cost structure has a paramount effect on system behavior. The classical result that the revenue-maximizing admission price is higher and the utilization lower than is socially optimal can be reversed under our generalized structure, and we identify the conditions driving this reversal under each mechanism. We show that the conditional bid equilibria are unique and induce the socially optimal allocations. The auctions yield gains in system net value and provider profit over uniform pricing, which are dramatically larger for the preemptive mechanism. Both auctions perform better under multiplicative compared to additive delay costs. The highest-value customers always gain under the preemptive, but may lose under the nonpreemptive auction. The lowest-value customers always gain in either auction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0156","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and auction mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This global crisis has spurred development of innovative management strategies to rebuild depleted fisheries and marine ecosystems. One highly touted strategy involves the design and creation of marine reserves (areas off limits to extractive uses) to rebuild fisheries and conserve marine biodiversity. In this paper, we propose an integrated sequence of methodologies that provides an objective, quantitative framework for the design of marine reserves in spatially heterogeneous coastal ocean environments. The marine reserve designs proposed here satisfy the multiple, often-conflicting criteria of disparate resource user groups. This research is the first attempt to explicitly explore the trade-off between the conservation goals of fishery management and coral reef protection and the consumptive interests of commercial and recreational fishing fleets. The spatial distribution and size abundance of reef fish stocks throughout the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem were estimated from a database consisting of more than 18,000 visual samples taken from 1979 to 2002. These distributions of multispecies abundance and biomass, in conjunction with a geographic database of coral reef habitats, are used to demonstrate an integer goal programming methodology for the design of networks of marine reserves, called plans. Once multiple plans are proposed, a simulation model is used to assess the effects of reserve size and shape on select Florida Keys reef fish populations under dynamic spatial and temporal conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0222","","MS","Multidisciplinary","6","['conservation', 'biodiversity', 'sustainability', 'resource management']","The article addresses the urgent need for conservation and sustainable management of marine ecosystems, highlighting the conflict between ecological goals and commercial interests.

We refer to this as state-dependent behavior, in contrast to the state-independent behavior of machines. In this paper, we develop several models for the state-dependent behavior of production workers. We then use these models to analyze the relation of line length to throughput in these systems. We find that state-dependent behavior makes serial lines more efficient and reduces the detrimental effects that longer line lengths have on throughput. In some cases, line efficiency can actually increase with length. This is a result of a higher percentage of workers having two buffers to provide feedback on the state of the line. Further, we show that workers who both speed up when they are likely to cause idle time for others and slow down when they are likely to become idle themselves improve the overall efficiency of the line.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0233","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production-line efficiency and worker behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A Strategic and Operational Assessment of Inspection Practices in Biotechnology","This paper theoretically and empirically examines the conventional wisdom in procurement management that often portrays supply inspections and supplier plant inspections as substitutes. We develop a theoretical model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however, may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a) external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which depends on the level of buffer inventory, (b) when knowledge sharing between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c) when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers. We empirically evaluate our model with a new data set drawn from a large biotechnology manufacturer. Empirical results provide broad support for theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational and strategic use of inspection practices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0235","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['quality', 'inspection', 'procurement']","The article primarily focuses on procurement management and inspection practices without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This paper examines how heterogeneity in the operating condition of firms' plant and equipment, which cannot be observed by policy makers, can affect the choice between incentives to encourage conversion to a cleaner technology. By relating different conditions of firms' plant and equipment to production costs, extent of environmental damage, and cost of conversion to a cleaner technology, we show when a perfectly discriminating incentive to encourage conversion is not feasible. In addition, we show that firms with plant and equipment in better condition will convert their technology to mitigate their environmental damage, and firms with plant and equipment in poorer condition will not. This and a series of additional results lead to conditions under which an administratively simple uniform lump-sum incentive to switch to cleaner technology is preferable to one based on output. These results and conditions extend to cases where there are network externalities in conversion, and where there is strategic timing in firms' choice of when to convert.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0238","","MS","Multidisciplinary","7","['environment', 'cleaner technology', 'mitigate', 'incentives']","The article focuses on the conversion to cleaner technology and the environmental impact of production practices, indicating a strong emphasis on sustainability and ethical considerations in business operations.

The demand processes experienced by the systems have different variabilities. The two decentralized systems consider an agreement to pool their production capacities.

We examine this issue using an analytical model that integrates base-stock inventory models with queuing models for the production capacity. The higher-variability demand is modeled as a hyperexponential renewal process, and the lower-variability demand is modeled as a Poisson process. In case of pooled capacity, the arrival process at the production queue is the superposition of the two processes. We prove conditions under which the first-come\u2013first-served operating rule will fail to achieve a Pareto improvement over the separate systems because it would increase inventory cost at the lower-variability warehouse. We then show cases under which the high-variability warehouse will see a reduction in inventory cost over the split system even if it accepts lower priority.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0245","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of production and inventory systems without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The context is the third-party logistics industry, in which a customer firm allows a service provider to assume responsibility for all or part of a critical business process. This business-to-business service environment is characterized by high levels of complexity (uncertainty, variability, equivocality) and network interdependence, key contextual attributes that enhance media richness' impact. We found a direct effect of media richness on relational performance and through it, indirect effects on satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, we found a direct effect of media richness on loyalty, which suggests that service firms in networked relationships provide loyalty-inducing benefits the genesis of which is not in the satisfaction created by the service itself. While past studies have examined the relationship of richness-related constructs and performance, no significant link was found.

More importantly, many of these papers led to the implementation of substantially new policies and practices, particularly in policing and firefighting. Much of this work originated in New York City, though many other cities subsequently adopted the resulting models and strategies. In this paper, we look at the context, content, and nature of the research and the factors that led to these early implementation successes. We then track the extent to which these original models are still affecting decision making in emergency response systems. We also examine the pace of development of new OR/MS models and applications in the area.

The wealth of information in these databases can be useful in identifying those customers most likely to purchase a new product and in predicting when this adoption may take place. This can assist database marketers in determining when individuals should be targeted for the promotion of a new product, which may increase the efficiency of manufacturing and distribution, and assure a faster return on investments. For this purpose, we propose a model that considers the timing of past purchases across multiple product categories and produces estimates of each customer's propensity of ever purchasing in a particular product category and of the timing of their purchases. The model is designed to help managers identify the best prospects for a new offer in one of multiple categories based on generalizations obtained from past offers. The proposed model also provides projections of aggregate penetration for new brands within the database, based on sample estimates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0256","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer database utilization for marketing efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The method is termed the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method, and although it has become widely used, not much is known about the properties of the estimator. This paper corrects this shortcoming using theory from the literature on seminonparametric series estimators. A central part of the LSM method is the approximation of a set of conditional expectation functions. We show that the approximations converge to the true expectation functions under general assumptions in a multiperiod, multidimensional setting. We obtain convergence rates in the two-period, multidimensional case, and we discuss the relation between the optimal rate of convergence and the properties of the conditional expectation. Furthermore, we show that the actual price estimates converge to the true price. This provides the mathematical foundation for the use of the LSM method in derivatives research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0155","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for option valuation without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that for a given confidence level, a CVaR constraint is tighter than a VaR constraint if the CVaR and VaR bounds coincide. Consequently, a CVaR constraint is more effective than a VaR constraint as a tool to control slightly risk-averse agents, but in the absence of a risk-free security, has a perverse effect in that it is more likely to force highly risk-averse agents to select portfolios with larger standard deviations. However, when the CVaR bound is appropriately larger than the VaR bound or when a risk-free security is present, a CVaR constraint \u201cdominates\u201d a VaR constraint as a risk management tool.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0201","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio selection and risk management without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The existing literature on GARCH models favors some rather complex volatility specifications whose relative performance is usually assessed through their likelihood based on a time series of asset returns. This paper compares a range of GARCH models along a different dimension, using option prices and returns under the risk-neutral as well as the physical probability measure. We judge the relative performance of various models by evaluating an objective function based on option prices. In contrast with returns-based inference, we find that our option-based objective function favors a relatively parsimonious model.

This paper is the first attempt to incorporate asset-based financing into production decisions. Instead of setting a known, exogenously determined budgetary constraint as most existing models suggest, we model the available cash in each period as a function of assets and liabilities that may be updated periodically according to the dynamics of the production activities. Furthermore, our models allow different interest rates on cash balance and outstanding loans, which is an enhancement over most traditional models in that inventory financed by a loan may be more expensive than that by out-of-pocket cash. We demonstrate the importance of joint consideration of production and financing decisions in a start-up setting in which the ability to grow the firm is mainly constrained by its limited capital and dependence on bank financing. We then explain the motivation for asset-based financing by examining the decision making at a bank and a set of retailers in a newsvendor setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0278","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and financial decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We approach this problem in a novel way by formulating a dynamic optimization model in which the demand function is isoelastic but the random demand process is quite general. Ultimately, what we find is a strong parallel between the dynamic pricing problem and dynamic inventory models. This parallel leads to a reinterpretation of the dynamic pricing problem as a price-setting newsvendor problem with recourse, which is useful not only because it yields insights into the optimal solution, but also because it leads to additional insights into how pricing recourse affects the actions and profits of a price-setting newsvendor. We make contributions in three areas: First, we develop structural properties that define an optimal pricing strategy over a finite horizon and investigate how that policy impacts a newsvendor's optimal procurement policy and optimal expected profit. Second, we establish a practical and efficient algorithm for computing the optimal prices. Third, we examine how market parameters affect the optimal solution through a series of numerical experiments that utilize the algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0026","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Agents find congestion costly and, hence, try to arrive when the system is underutilized. Working in discrete time, we characterize pure-strategy Nash equilibria for the case of ample service capacity. In this case, agents try to spread themselves out as much as possible and their self-interested actions will lead to a socially optimal outcome if all agents have the same well-behaved delay cost function. For even modest sized problems, the set of possible pure-strategy Nash equilibria is quite large, making implementation potentially cumbersome. We consequently examine mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and show that there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. Not only is this equilibrium independent of the number of agents and their individual delay cost functions, the arrival pattern it generates approaches a discrete-time Poisson process as the number of agents and arrival points gets large. Our results extend to the case of time varying preferences. With an appropriate initialization, the results also extend to a system with limited capacity. Our model lends support to the traditional literature on managing service systems. This work has generally ignored customers strategically choosing arrival times. Rather it is commonly assumed that customers seek service according to some well-behaved process (e.g., that interarrival times follow a renewal process). We show that assuming Poisson arrivals is an acceptable assumption even with strategic customers if the population is large and the horizon is long.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0030","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of strategic behavior in service systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Acting independently, supply chain partners fail to weigh the cost burden they impose on upstream suppliers when their replenishment order quantities vary from period to period. This paper explores a new approach to coordinate multiple stages in the supply chain by controlling, through appropriate downstream inventory management, the demand variability that is propagated to upstream stages. We propose and analyze a coordinated inventory replenishment policy that uses \"order smoothing\" to reduce order-size variability and thus reduce overall system costs, including both inventory and transportation costs. We characterize the optimal parameter values for smoothing alternatives (such as exponential smoothing and moving weighted average policies), assess their economic benefits, and develop insights regarding supply chain contexts that might benefit most significantly from reducing the variability of orders to upstream stages. Using the distribution network for specialty brand appliances as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the potential cost savings that order-smoothing strategies can yield compared to the uncoordinated case when individual firms separately minimize their costs. The magnitude of savings depends on several factors, including the variability in consumer demand, level of product variety, and degree of inventory aggregation in the distribution system. Based on our analytical results, we develop a framework to assess cost reduction opportunities through variability control for different supply chain scenarios.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0031","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The study of the cell's production technology provides us with insights that are potentially useful in industrial manufacturing. When comparing cell metabolism with manufacturing techniques in industry, we find some striking commonalities, but also some important differences. Like today's well-run factories, the cell operates a very lean production system, assures quality at the source, and uses component commonality to simplify production. While we can certainly learn from how the cell accomplishes these parallels, it is even more interesting to look at how the cell operates differently. In biological cells, all products and machines are built from a small set of common building blocks that circulate in local recycling loops. Production equipment is added, removed, or renewed instantly when needed. The cell's manufacturing unit is highly autonomous and reacts quickly to a wide range of changes in the local environment. Although this \"organic production system\" is very different from existing manufacturing systems, some of its principles are applicable to manufacturing, and indeed, a few can even be seen emerging today. Thus, the organic production system can be viewed as a possible scenario for the future of manufacturing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0033","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['production systems', 'biological cells', 'manufacturing']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of manufacturing and biological systems without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can make it more difficult for the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large fluctuations in supplier production levels from period to period. Using \"stale\" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the fluctuations in production levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the fluctuations in production levels compared to that of using current information. We also study a cooperative supply chain setting and, surprisingly, we find in numerical examples that our proposed policy results in very small increases in the expected systemwide inventory and shortage costs compared to a systemwide optimal policy, while reducing the fluctuations in production levels.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0034","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is a departure from previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior can be observed in various industries (e.g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. Production of olive oil is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its olives for olive oil production and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total production of olive oil changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1030.0024","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production planning in the olive oil industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The rate to harvest crops and the corresponding capital investment are critical strategic decisions in situations where poor weather conditions present a risk of crop loss. In this article, we discuss a case study of the Concord grape harvest and develop a mathematical model to control harvest risk. The model involves differentiation of a joint probability distribution that represents risks associated with the length of the harvest season and the size of the crop. This approach is becoming popular as a means of dealing with complex problems involving operational and supply chain risk. Significant cost avoidance, in the millions of dollars, results from practical implementation of the Harvest Model. Using real data, we found that the Harvest Model provides lower-cost solutions in situations involving moderate variability in both the length of season and the crop size as compared to solutions based on imposed risk policies determined by management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1040.0035","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management in agricultural operations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The present study applies portfolio theory to determine an efficient combination of advisory programs using a nonlinear integer programming framework. The optimization results provide some evidence that an efficient portfolio provides significantly greater risk and return benefits compared to individual programs and external benchmarks.

However, based on a review of the theoretical literature using an activity-based costing framework and distinguishing between cost-driver and cost-rate effects, I conclude that the cost picture is more subtle. In other words, it is too early to make any general statement about the effect of increasing commonality on total costs.

The paper provides a general modelling framework to analyze the ties between market segmentation decisions, incentives, and process performance in such service-delivery systems. The firm is modelled as a single-server queue, in a principal-agent framework. Customers have different value-generation potentials whose realizations are observed by the server but not by the manager of the firm. The manager determines a market segmentation scheme given an overall customer value-generation profile, which divides customers into two groups (high and low), and also determines a service level for each segment. The server decides which of the two available service levels (high and low) to provide for each customer, given a compensation scheme offered by the manager. The optimal market segmentation decision, optimal service-level choice, and a set of optimal linear incentive contracts that enable their implementation are characterized. The robustness of these strategies is explored with respect to model parameters and assumptions. It is shown that a market segmentation scheme that combines revenue generation concerns with their process implications is essential for success.

In addition, unlike the standard M/M/1 model, each service instance is associated with a variable reward that reflects the quality of the transplant organ, and patients have the option to refuse an organ (service) offer if they expect future offers to be better. Under an assumption of perfect and complete information, it is demonstrated that the queueing discipline is a potent instrument that can be used to maximize social welfare. In particular, first-come-first-serve (FCFS) amplifies patients' desire to refuse offers of marginal quality, and generates excessive organ wastage. By contrast, last-come-first-serve (LCFS) contains the inefficiencies engendered by patient choice and achieves optimal organ utilization.

We show that information cost and demand correlation are important factors for determining the optimal extent of FDI sharing. For a simplified version of the problem where only a single customer is contacted, we analyze how the optimal solution is affected by nonidentically distributed or nonuniformly correlated demands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0061","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0065","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of linear optimization and does not engage with socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

Focusing on a particular class of robot move sequences, we identify all potentially optimal robot move sequences for the part-sequencing problem in a two-machine dual-gripper robot cell. In the case when the gripper switching time is sufficiently small, we specify the best robot move sequence in the class. We prove the problem of finding an optimal part sequence to be strongly NP-hard, even when the robot move sequence is specified. We provide a heuristic approach to solve the general two-machine problem and evaluate its performance on the set of randomly generated problem instances.

The problem is to jointly determine overbooking levels for the reservation classes, taking into account the substitution options. Such problems arise in a variety of revenue management contexts, including multicabin aircraft, back-to-back scheduled flights on the same leg, hotels with multiple room types, and mixed-vehicle car rental fleets. We model this problem as a two-period optimization problem. In the first period, reservations are accepted given only probabilistic knowledge of cancellations. In the second period, cancellations are realized and surviving customers are assigned to the various inventory classes to maximize the net benefit of assignments (e.g., minimize penalties). For this formulation, we show that the expected revenue function is submodular in the overbooking levels, which implies the natural property that the optimal overbooking level in one reservation class decreases with the number of reservations held in the other reservation classes. We then propose a stochastic gradient algorithm to find the joint optimal overbooking levels. We compare the decisions of the model to those produced by more naive heuristics on some examples motivated by airline applications. The results show that accounting for substitution when setting overbooking levels has a small, but still significant, impact on revenues and costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0079","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to revenue management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

All problem data are allowed to vary across periods, including demand distributions, costs, and revenues. A forecast horizon, when it exists, is a finite problem horizon with the property that the corresponding first-period optimal production decision remains optimal regardless of demand and cost projections beyond this horizon. Thus, a forecast horizon allows us to reduce the amount of future data we need to forecast to solve for an optimal first decision for the infinite horizon problem. In this paper, we establish the existence of a forecast horizon under the assumptions that (1) costs and revenues are time-varying linear, and (2) demand is never eventually zero. A key result for establishing the existence and computation of forecast horizons is the monotonicity, and hence convergence, of optimal first-period policies as the horizon increases of finite horizon versions of the infinite horizon problem. A closed-form formula is provided for computing a forecast horizon that depends only on the discount factor and uniform upper and lower bounds on demand and unit production and inventory holding costs. In particular, its value is independent of, and determined in advance of, forecasting the demand distribution. We show that the effect of uncertainty in demand is to increase the forecast horizon associated with a deterministic problem by a constant plus a factor equal to one plus the ratio of these upper to lower bounds on per-period demand. The associated forecast horizon can be surprisingly short, even a few days, when the inventory costs are high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0080","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production scheduling and stochastic demand without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The motivation is the staffing problem of large call centers, which we have modeled as M/M/N queues with N, the number of agents, being large. Within our framework, we determine the asymptotically optimal staffing level N* that trades off agents' costs with service quality: the higher the latter, the more expensive is the former. As an alternative to this optimization, we also develop a constraint satisfaction approach where one chooses the least N* that adheres to a given constraint on waiting cost. Either way, the analysis gives rise to three regimes of operation: quality-driven, where the focus is on service quality; efficiency-driven, which emphasizes agents' costs; and a rationalized regime that balances, and in fact unifies, the other two. Numerical experiments reveal remarkable accuracy of our asymptotic approximations: over a wide range of parameters, from the very small to the extremely large, N* is exactly optimal, or it is accurate to within a single agent. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by revisiting the square-root safety staffing principle, which is a long-existing rule of thumb for staffing the M/M/N queue. In its simplest form, our rule is as follows: if c is the hourly cost of an agent, and a is the hourly cost of customers' delay, then N* = R + y* (a/c)\u221aR, where R is the offered load, and y*(\u00b7) is a function that is easily computable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0081","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization of staffing in call centers without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

The main practical contribution of this paper is a general algorithm for constructing upper and lower bounds on the true price of the option using any approximation to the option price. We show that our bounds are tight, so that if the initial approximation is close to the true price of the option, the bounds are also guaranteed to be close. We also explicitly characterize the worst-case performance of the pricing bounds. The computation of the lower bound is straightforward and relies on simulating the suboptimal exercise strategy implied by the approximate option price. The upper bound is also computed using Monte Carlo simulation. This is made feasible by the representation of the American option price as a solution of a properly defined dual minimization problem, which is the main theoretical result of this paper. Our algorithm proves to be accurate on a set of sample problems where we price call options on the maximum and the geometric mean of a collection of stocks.

When some outputs and inputs are unknown decision variables, such as bounded and ordinal data, the DEA model becomes a nonlinear programming problem and is called imprecise DEA (IDEA). The nonlinear IDEA program can be converted into a linear program by an algorithm based upon scale transformations and variable alterations. Such an algorithm requires a set of special computational codes for each evaluation, because a different objective function and a different constraint with a set of new variables are present for each unit under evaluation. The current paper revisits a published Korean telecommunication analysis, and, by so doing, presents a new and simple approach to execute the IDEA through the standard linear DEA models. This greatly enhances the applicability of IDEA in applications, and the IDEA analysis is no longer limited to obtaining the efficiency scores. The key to the new approach lies in the finding that imprecise data can be easily converted into exact data. Based upon the exact data, models can be developed to determine all possible multiple optimal solutions in imprecise data, and to perform efficiency sensitivity analysis in IDEA.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0072","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Customers waiting to be served may abandon the queue, and there is a cost penalty associated with such abandonments. Service rates, abandonment rates, and abandonment penalties are generally different for the different classes. The problem studied is that of dynamically scheduling the various classes. We consider the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime, where the total arrival rate and the number of servers both become large in such a way that the system's traffic intensity parameter approaches one. An approximating diffusion control problem is described and justified as a purely formal (that is, nonrigorous) heavy traffic limit. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the limiting diffusion control problem is shown to have a smooth (classical) solution, and optimal controls are shown to have an extremal or \u201cbang-bang\u201d character. Several useful qualitative insights are derived from the mathematical analysis, including a \u201csquare-root rule\u201d for sizing large systems and a sharp contrast between system behavior in the Halfin-Whitt regime versus that observed in the \u201cconventional\u201d heavy traffic regime.

The manufacturer\u2019s production facility is modeled as an exponential single-server queue with two classes of customers that differ in price sensitivity and delay sensitivity. The manufacturer chooses the service rate and a static price for each class of customer, and then dynamically quotes leadtimes to potential customers and decides the order in which customers are processed. The arrival rate for each class decreases linearly with price and leadtime. The manufacturer\u2019s objective is to maximize profit, subject to the constraint that each customer must be processed within the promised leadtime. Assuming that some customers will tolerate a long delivery leadtime, we show that this problem has a simple near-optimal solution. Under our proposed policy, capacity utilization is near 100%. Impatient customers pay a premium for immediate delivery and receive priority in scheduling, whereas patient customers are quoted a leadtime proportional to the current queue length. Queue length and leadtime can be closely approximated by a reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process. Hence, we have a closed form expression for profit, and choose prices and capacity to optimize this. In case customers may choose either the class 1 deal or the class 2 deal, the proposed policy is made incentive compatible by quoting a leadtime for the class 2 (patient) customers that is longer than the actual queueing delay.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0089","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of leadtime differentiation and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each agent wants to minimize a certain objective function, which depends on the completion times of its jobs only. The objective functions we consider in this paper are maximum of regular functions (associated with each job), number of late jobs, and total weighted completion times. We obtain different scenarios, depending on the objective function of each agent, and on the structure of the processing system (single machine or shop). For each scenario, we address the complexity of various problems, namely, finding the optimal solution for one agent with a constraint on the other agent's cost function, finding single nondominated schedules (i.e., such that a better schedule for one of the two agents necessarily results in a worse schedule for the other agent), and generating all nondominated schedules.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0092","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical scheduling problems and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The first discovery led to a new age in genetics, and the second event marked the beginning of a new era that uses the genome in medicine. The international efforts to determine the human DNA sequence and assess its ethical, legal, and social implications started in 1990. Since then, the data from the project has been available in public databases for researchers and scientists around the world. The vast increase in biological data led to increasing interest in computational biology and an emerging multidisciplinary research area known as bioinformatics. Most people working in this area have mathematics, biology, biochemistry, or computer science backgrounds and have learned about the field by using tools from another discipline to answer questions in biology. The current challenge is to utilize the genome data to its full extent and to develop tools that improve our understanding of biological pathways and accelerate drug discovery. Many of the algorithms needed to solve these problems have management science and operations research aspects. This paper introduces some of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics to an operations research audience and demonstrates the application of management science tools in their formulation and solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0095","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['ethical', 'social implications']","The article mentions 'ethical' and 'social implications' in the context of bioinformatics and management science, indicating a slight awareness of ethical considerations.

The networks determine the exact location in the show that a commercial will air at a later stage, usually close to the airdate of the show. There are several criteria the networks must meet in scheduling commercials in a show. The schedule should be such that no two commercials promoting competing products from different clients air in the same break. The audience ratings tend to be higher at the start and end of a commercial break than during the middle of the break. Therefore, advertisers generally prefer the first and last positions in a commercial segment, to those in the middle. TV networks normally promise their clients an equitable rotation of commercials among the positions within a commercial break. The scheduling of commercials on shows is traditionally done manually and is a cumbersome, time-intensive, and error-prone process. We formulate the commercial scheduling problem as an integer program and develop near-optimal heuristics for automatically scheduling the commercials to meet all the requirements. We implemented our algorithm at the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). In addition to reducing sales personnel costs by automating the scheduling of commercials, our work has increased customer satisfaction by minimizing errors in meeting customer requirements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0083","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of scheduling commercials and improving operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The objective is to minimize the total multiechelon inventory, transportation, and facility location costs.

The pricing subproblem that arises from the column generation algorithm gives rise to a new class of the submodular function minimization problem.

Special attention is paid to winner-take-all contests, which we define as contests with relatively few winners receiving relatively large awards, but we consider the full range of values of the proportion of winners. If a contestant has the opportunity to modify the distribution of her performance, what strategy is advantageous? When the proportion of winners is less than one-half, a riskier performance distribution is preferred; when this proportion is greater than one-half, it is better to choose a less risky distribution. Using a multinormal model, we consider modifications in the variability of the distribution and in correlations with the performance of other contestants. Increasing variability and decreasing correlations lead to improved chances of winning when the proportion of winners is less than one-half, and the opposite directions should be taken for proportions greater than one-half. Thus, it is better to take chances and to attempt to distance oneself from the other contestants (i.e., to break away from the herd) when there are few winners; a more conservative, herding strategy makes sense when there are many winners. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that the probability of winning can change substantially as variability and/or correlations are modified. Furthermore, in a game-theoretic setting in which all contestants can make modifications, choosing a riskier (less risky) performance distribution when the proportion of winners is low (high) is the dominant best-response strategy. We briefly consider some practical issues related to the recommended strategies and some possible extensions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0098","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on game-theoretic strategies in contests without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The decision maker needs to insert the new jobs into the existing schedule without excessively disrupting it. Two classes of models are considered. First, we minimize the scheduling cost of all the jobs, subject to a limit on the disruption caused to the original schedule, where this disruption is measured in various ways. In the second class, a total cost objective, which includes both the original cost measure and the cost of disruption, is minimized. For both classes and various costs based on classical scheduling objectives, and for almost all problems, we provide either an efficient algorithm or a proof that such an algorithm is unlikely to exist. We also show how to extend both classes of models to deal with multiple disruptions in the form of repeated arrivals of new jobs. Our work refocuses the extensive literature on scheduling problems towards issues of rescheduling, which are important because of the frequency with which disruptions occur in manufacturing practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0101","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical scheduling problems and cost minimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The combinatorial aspect can be explicit, e.g., through the use of \u201cmax,\u201d \u201cmin,\u201d or \u201cif\u201d statements in a model; or implicit, as in the case of bilevel optimization, where the combinatorial structure arises from the possible choices of active constraints in the lower-level problem. In analyzing such problems, it is desirable to decouple the combinatorial aspect from the nonlinear aspect and deal with them separately. This paper suggests a problem formulation that explicitly decouples the two aspects. A suitable generalization of the traditional Lagrangian framework allows an extension of the popular sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methodology to such structurally nonconvex nonlinear programs. We show that the favorable local convergence properties of SQP are retained in this setting and illustrate the potential of the approach in the context of optimization problems with max-min constraints that arise, for example, in robust optimization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0102","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

External demand could occur at each node. When inventory is insufficient to meet requirements at a node, a portion of this demand is backordered and the remaining is lost. External demands, as well as lead times for inventory purchase, assembly, and transportation, are stochastic. In each period, linear sales revenues and the following costs, all linear, are charged at each node: (a) inventory purchase/assembly/transfer cost to receive inventory, (b) holding cost, (c) backorder cost, and (d) lost sales cost. When the objective function of interest is a discounted sum of profits over a finite planning horizon, it is shown that the sales prices and the inventory purchase/assembly/transfer cost parameters can be assumed to be zero without loss of generality. The result is proved for every realization of demands and lead times. Some extensions to these results are discussed.

Theories have been established for various basic constructs of the system of either finite or infinite horizon, except for the case where production capacity is finite and production cost contains a fixed (as well as a variable) component. It was conjectured in earlier research papers that the modified (s, S) policy would be optimal to the finite-capacity, fixed-cost model in infinite horizon. This paper studies the long-run limiting behavior of such systems. It proves that the limiting cost function exists, and there exist stationary policies that are optimal in the long run. The optimal policy, however, is not of the modified (s, S) type in general, but continues to exhibit the X-Y band structure: Whenever the inventory level drops below X, order up to capacity; when the inventory level is above Y, do nothing. When the inventory level is between X and Y, however, the ordering pattern seems to be changing from problem to problem. Nevertheless, based on a concept called (C, K)-convexity, introduced in this paper, the X-Y band is shown to be no more than one capacity of width. One calculation for the bounds on such X and Y boundaries that are tight in some cases is also provided. By exploring the X-Y band structure, a linear program model is proposed to find the optimal policy completely. Finally, an attempt is made to compare \u201cthe best modified (s, S) policy\u201d with the optimal one, and a numerical example indicates that the deviation may be more than 11% in cost performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1030.0104","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and optimal policy characterization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The special case of the car pooling problem where all cars are identical can be modeled as a Dial-a-Ride Problem. In this paper, we propose both an exact and a heuristic method for the car pooling problem, based on two integer programming formulations of the problem. The exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the problem.

The number of bidders in each period as well as the individual bidders' valuations are random but stationary over time. There is a holding cost for inventory and a unit cost for ordering more stock from an outside supplier. Backordering is not allowed. The firm must decide how to conduct its auctions and how to replenish its stock over time to maximize its profits. We show that the optimal auction and replenishment policy for this problem is quite simple, consisting of running a standard first-price or second-price auction with a fixed reserve price in each period and following an order-up-to (basestock) policy for replenishing inventory at the end of each period. Moreover, the optimal basestock level can be easily computed. We then compare this optimal basestock, reserve-price-auction policy to a traditional basestock, list-price policy. We prove that in the limiting case of one buyer per period and in the limiting case of a large number of buyers per period and linear holding cost, list pricing is optimal. List pricing also becomes optimal as the holding cost tends to zero. Numerical comparisons confirm these theoretical results and show that auctions provide significant benefits when: (1) the number of buyers is moderate, (2) holding costs are high, or (3) there is high variability in the number of buyers per period.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0105","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to inventory pricing and auction strategies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In the literature this problem is usually referred to as the airline crew rostering problem. It consists of constructing monthly schedules for crew members by assigning them pairings, rest periods, annual and sick leave, training periods, union activities, and so forth, so as to satisfy the collective agreements and security rules. We formulate the airline crew rostering problem as a 0\u20131 multicommodity flow problem where each employee corresponds to a commodity; determining a monthly schedule for an employee is the same as computing a path on a suitably defined graph while still satisfying union conventions. A preprocessing phase is performed that reduces the dimension of the graph.

It finds its origin in the printing of Tetra-bricks in the beverage industry. Combining different types of bricks in one printing pattern reduces the stock. With each brick, a number of colors are associated, and the total number of colors for the whole pattern cannot exceed a given limit. We develop a branch-and-price algorithm to obtain proven optimal solutions. After introducing a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation for the problem, we derive cutting planes to tighten the LP relaxation. We present heuristics and develop a branching scheme, avoiding complex pricing problem modifications. We present some further algorithmic enhancements, such as the implementation of dominance rules and a lower bound based on a combinatorial relaxation. Finally, we discuss computational results for real-life data sets. In addition to the introduction of a new bin-packing problem, this paper illustrates the complex balance in branch-and-price algorithms among using cutting planes, the branching scheme, and the tractability of the pricing problem. It also shows how dominance rules can be implemented in a branch-and-price framework, resulting in a substantial reduction in computation time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0112","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to algorithmic optimization in the beverage industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We obtain two such linear programs by formulating the control problem as a Markov decision process and then replacing the optimal value function with the sum of single-customer inventory value functions. The resulting approximation yields statewise lower bounds on optimal infinite-horizon discounted costs. We present a linear program that takes into account inventory dynamics and economics in allocating transportation costs for stochastic inventory routing. On test instances we find that these allocations do not introduce any error in the value function approximations relative to the best approximations that can be achieved without them. Also, unlike other approaches, we do not restrict the set of allowable vehicle itineraries in any way. Instead, we develop an efficient algorithm to both generate and eliminate itineraries during solution of the linear programs and control policy.

Real options theory is used to derive nonlinear partial-integro-differential equations (PIDEs) for the valuation and optimal operating strategies of both types of facilities. The equations are designed to incorporate a wide class of spot price models that can exhibit the same time-dependent, mean-reverting dynamics and price spikes as those observed in most electricity markets. Particular attention is paid to the operational characteristics of real power generators. For thermal power plants, these characteristics include variable start-up times and costs, control response time lags, minimum generating levels, nonlinear output functions, and structural limitations on ramp rates. For hydroelectric units, head effects and environmental constraints are addressed. We illustrate the models with numerical examples of a pump storage facility and a thermal power plant. This PIDE framework can achieve high levels of computational speed and accuracy while incorporating a wide range of spot price dynamics and operational characteristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0117","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of power plant valuation and operation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Several properties of the optimal solution are discussed. Based on these properties, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed. The efficiency of the dynamic program is further improved through the use of Monge matrices. Using the results developed for the first model, an O(n3log n) algorithm is developed to solve the second model, which has a general form of product acquisition cost structure, including a fixed charge for each acquisition, a variable unit production cost, and a freight cost with a truckload discount.

These devices can detect infiltrators that come within a given distance of them, and it is assumed that an infiltrator so detected can be apprehended before he can fulfill his mission. Previous work has concentrated on cases in which there is just one infiltrator and the infiltrator knows both the number of devices and their detection radii, but the emphasis in this paper is on situations in which the defender does not know the number of infiltrators and the infiltrators have only partial information about the devices. It is shown that the defender has a strategy that is optimal against any number of infiltrators when the detection radii satisfy certain conditions and, in particular, when the detection radii all lie in specific intervals. In the latter case, the infiltrators can also act optimally with only partial information concerning the detection devices. In addition, we obtain results giving the number of infiltrators that will ensure that at least one gets through undetected for various types of partial information available to the infiltrators.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0122","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to defense strategies against infiltrators without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We call this relation an invariance relation in the sense that it does not change for a variety of single-sever queues (with batch arrivals and batch services) and some multiserver queues (with batch arrivals and deterministic service times) that satisfy a certain set of assumptions. Making use of this relation, we also present a simple method of deriving the probability generating functions (PGFs) of the stationary numbers in queue and in system, as well as some of their properties. This is illustrated by several examples, which show that new simple derivations of old results as well as new results can be obtained in a unified manner. Furthermore, we show that the invariance relation and the method we are presenting are easily generalized to analyze queues with batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) arrivals. Most of the results are presented under the discrete-time setting. The corresponding continuous-time results, however, are covered as well because deriving the results for continuous-time queues runs exactly parallel to that for their discrete-time counterparts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0116","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Major advertisers purchase several slots to air commercials during a given time period on a broadcast network. We study the problem of scheduling advertiser's commercials in the slots it purchased when the same commercial is to be aired multiple times. Under such a situation, the advertisers typically want the airings of a commercial to be as evenly spaced as possible. Thus, our objective is to schedule a set of commercials in a set of available slots such that multiple airings of the same commercial are as evenly spaced as possible. A natural formulation of this problem is a mixed-integer program that can be solved using third-party solvers. We also develop a branch-and-bound algorithm based on a problem-specific bounding scheme. Both approaches fail to solve larger problem instances within a reasonable time frame. We present an alternative mixed-integer program that lends itself to an efficient solution.

It places replenishment orders to raise the inventory position\u2014that is, inventory on hand plus inventory in transit\u2014to exactly S at the beginning of every period. The lead time associated with each of these orders is random. However, the lead-time process is such that these orders do not cross. Demand that cannot be met with inventory available on hand is lost permanently. We state and prove some sample-path properties of lost sales, inventory on hand at the end of a period, and inventory position at the end of a period as functions of S. The main result is the convexity of the expected discounted sum of holding and lost-sales costs as a function of S. This result justifies the use of common search procedures or linear programming methods to determine optimal base-stock levels for inventory systems with lost sales and stochastic lead times. It should be noted that the class of base-stock policies is suboptimal for such systems, and we are primarily interested in them because of their widespread use.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0130","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and stochastic demand without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2004","52","5","Rodney P.

The factory's production capacity is finite, and there are transportation economies of scale in replenishing the retailer inventories.

We construct a Brownian approximation of the optimal control problem, assuming that the manufacturer uses a \u201cdual base-stock\u201d policy to control replenishment from the two sources and that her objective is to minimize average cost. A closed-form expression is obtained for one optimal base-stock policy and an analytical expression is derived from which the other optimal base stock can be computed numerically. We show conditions under which the objective is convex in capacity, and the unique globally optimal capacity can be computed numerically. We thus provide a tractable approximation to the two-source problem, which is generally intractable. We demonstrate the accuracy of this approximation for an M/M/1 model. We also draw managerial insight from the Brownian optimal base-stock results into how the optimal base-stock policies control the inventory distribution and under what conditions the contingent source is used to build inventory or to resolve backorders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0135","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical and mathematical approach to a production-inventory problem without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In some situations, the target-oriented preference conditions are analogous to reliability theory conditions for series or parallel failure modes in a system. In such cases, reinterpreting the conditions using reliability concepts can be useful in assessing the preference function. The target-oriented approach is also a generalization of common forms of goal programming.

This paper considers a dynamic VRPTW with stochastic customers, where the goal is to maximize the number of serviced customers. It presents a multiple scenario approach (MSA) that continuously generates routing plans for scenarios including known and future requests. Decisions during execution use a distinguished plan chosen, at each decision, by a consensus function. The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30% and 80%. They indicate that MSA exhibits dramatic improvements over approaches not exploiting stochastic information, that the use of consensus function improves the quality of the solutions significantly, and that the benefits of MSA increase with the (effective) degree of dynamism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0124","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in vehicle routing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When holding and shortage costs are high, carrying inventory could be even more expensive for a capacitated production system. Recent developments in information technology and sales strategies enabled firms to acquire, collect, or induce advance demand information. We address a periodic-review, stochastic, capacitated, finite and infinite horizon production system faced by a manufacturer who has the ability to obtain advance demand information. We establish optimal policies and characterize their behavior with respect to capacity, fixed costs, advance demand information, and the planning horizon. With a numerical study, we quantify the value of advance demand information and additional capacity for specific problem instances.

Demands in different periods are random variables that are independent of each other and their distributions depend on the product price. Pricing and ordering decisions are made at the beginning of each period and all shortages are backlogged. Ordering cost includes both a fixed cost and a variable cost proportional to the amount ordered. The objective is to find an inventory policy and a pricing strategy maximizing expected profit over the finite horizon. We show that when the demand model is additive, the profit-to-go functions are k-concave and hence an (s, S, p) policy is optimal. In such a policy, the period inventory is managed based on the classical (s, S) policy and price is determined based on the inventory position at the beginning of each period. For more general demand functions, i.e., multiplicative plus additive functions, we demonstrate that the profit-to-go function is not necessarily k-concave and an (s, S, p) policy is not necessarily optimal. We introduce a new concept, the symmetric k-concave functions, and apply it to provide a characterization of the optimal policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0127","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control and pricing strategies with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The firm has the option to invest in dedicated resources as well as a more expensive, flexible resource that can satisfy both products. While the resource investment decision is made under demand uncertainty, pricing and resource allocation decisions are postponed to the time when demand curves are realized. Our analysis provides the structure of the firm's optimal resource investment strategy as a function of demand parameters and investment costs, and shows that the flexible resource investment decision follows a threshold policy. We also show that it can be optimal for the firm to invest in the flexible resource even when demand patterns are perfectly positively correlated. The reason for flexible capacity investment in this case is financial rather than risk pooling. On the other hand, we show that it can be optimal for the firm not to invest in the flexible resource even when demand patterns are perfectly negatively correlated. The flexible resource investment decision in this case depends on the profitability of the two products.

Initially, we consider a contractual alliance doing multiple projects and argue that the critical organization decisions for any  project are whether one or both partners should be involved, whether the  partners should work with little or considerable interaction, and whether decision-making authority should reside in a project manager or be consensual. Based on the answers to these questions, we identify at least four viable project organization options. We next examine the option that would be selected under conditions involving the alliance's newness, whether a cooperative history exists, and the distribution of skills for the project. Under each condition, we compare the costs and benefits of the options with respect to the underlying transaction costs, potential for learning, and the ability to contribute to developing a social relations network. By allowing variations in time-to-market pressures, the tacit knowledge that a partner can obtain from the project, and the partners' need to work closely together on future  projects, we can determine the points at which costs and benefits indicate a switch from one organization option to another. Finally, we indicate how to adjust the theory for it to apply to a contractual alliance doing only one project and to an institutional alliance such as a joint venture.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1030.0052","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['alliance governance', 'social relations network', 'cooperative history']","The article primarily focuses on organizational structures and decision-making in strategic alliances without a significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

When the dominant nodes in an innovation network are committed to open regimes of information disclosure, the entire structure is characterized by less tightly monitored ties.

The first part of the article relates the concept of complexity to the production tasks of the organization by deriving measures of the complexity of production and planning tasks within the organization. This move allows us to analyze organizational activities in terms of the computational complexity of the tasks that the organization carries out. Drawing on concepts from theoretical computer science, the article introduces a taxonomy of production tasks based on their computational complexity and shows how to use the notion of computational complexity to analyze organizational phenomena such as vertical integration disintegration, the choice between markets and organizations as performers of particular production tasks, and the internal partitioning of organizational tasks and activities. The article then relates the complexity of the production function of the organization to the ways in which organizations structure themselves. It attempts to bring theorizing about organizational behavior based on complexity theory closer to the conceptual realm of \"mainstream\" organization theory and to make the concepts of complexity theory more useful to empirical examinations of firm dynamics and organizational behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1030.0058","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational complexity and computational tasks without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Based on work histories of a sample of urban residents drawn from 14 Chinese cities in six provinces, we assess the extent and direction of organizational transformation by analyzing changes in promotion patterns between the prereform era (1949\u20131979) and the reform era (1980\u20131994). We begin with Walder's dual-path model and examine distinctive mechanisms for promotion along two institutionalized\u2014administrative and professional\u2014career lines. We enrich Walder's model by considering the impact of macropolitical processes on career dynamics and the effect of emerging market mechanisms on different organizational sectors. Our findings show that there have been both continuity and significant changes in the criteria and opportunities of promotion in Chinese organizations across the two periods. In the reform era, more educated managers who were recently recruited into the organizations had the highest probability of being promoted. There were also significant variations in promotion patterns across career lines and organizational sectors, reflecting the impacts of both institutional  persistence and emerging market forces.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1030.0046","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['promotion', 'organizational transformation', 'career dynamics']","The article discusses changes in promotion patterns and organizational transformation in China, which touches on themes of equity in career advancement.

We studied the effects of ownership reform and individuals' collectivist values on rewards-allocation preferences of employees in Chinese state-owned enterprises, and how these relationships were mediated by employees' productivity goal  orientation. We predicted the effects of ownership reform and collectivism on rewards-allocation preferences based on the model of allocation goal priority and the conceptual distinctions of vertical and horizontal collectivism. With data from four pairs of public state-owned enterprises (i.e., listed on the stock market) versus pure state-owned enterprises, we found the following results. First, employees of enterprises that had experienced a greater degree of ownership reform expressed stronger preferences for differential allocation rules (e.g., job position and performance) but weaker preferences for equalitarian allocation rules (e.g., group and individual equality). Second, vertical collectivism was positively related to preferences for differential  allocation rules, but horizontal collectivism was positively related to preferences for equalitarian allocation rules. Third, the effects of both ownership reform and vertical collectivism on differential allocation preferences were mediated by productivity goal orientation.

In a sample of 605 matched cases of employees and their immediate supervisors from a large, reformed state-owned firm, organizational support was found to relate to affective commitment more strongly than to organizational citizenship behavior. Personal relations, however, were found to relate similarly to affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moderator effects are evident with the less-traditional Chinese employees manifesting greater citizenship behavior than do more-traditional Chinese, in response to a high-quality relationship with their supervisor. More-traditional Chinese contribute citizenship behavior that is moderately high, regardless of the quality of their relationship with their supervisor.

This paper draws on institutional and resource dependence theories to examine this fundamental transformation of firm capital structure during China's transition. I propose that managers borrowed from external sources even when internal funds were available because retained earnings were considered state assets. Firms used retained earnings to signal financial health but borrowed externally to reduce dependence on the state. Uncertainty during transformation produced interfirm imitation of borrowing strategies, particularly imitation of local and high status others. I argue that the dynamics of market development shaped firm borrowing strategies and that these strategies are best viewed as trajectories over time. Analysis of survey data on the 1980\u20131989 capital structure of formerly state-owned firms provides support for these arguments and highlights the importance of institutional context in understanding corporate borrowing and strategic decision making.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0043","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['financial dependence', 'state assets', 'borrowing strategies']","The article primarily focuses on financial strategies and capital structure during China's economic transition, with minimal emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

A conceptual distinction is made between inertia, the momentum associated with strategic persistence, and the momentum of strategic change. Building on this distinction, a theoretical framework is developed that examines the influence of various change-related events and social processes on momentum during the early stages of organizational change. The research reported in this manuscript was conducted over a 10-month period in an organization attempting to change its culture, employing both qualitative and longitudinal quantitative methods. This study provides validity evidence for the proposed momentum construct and identifies various factors that predict momentum.

Firm-Specific Uncertainty, Market Uncertainty, and Network Partner Selection","In this study, we address the topic of interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect the choice of alliance and interlock partners. While many studies have been devoted to investigating various factors driving network partner choice, there is also an interesting and unexplored tension in this body of work. On the one hand, much work emphasizes change in social structure\u2014showing that firms expand networks by forming new relationships with new partners. At the same time, other scholars emphasize stability of social structure\u2014showing that firms tend to choose past exchange partners. We seek to reconcile this tension by proposing that firms form new relationships with new partners as a form of exploration, and form additional relationships with existing partners as a form of exploitation (March 1991). Further, whether exploration or exploitation is chosen depends on the type of uncertainty that firms are facing: whether it is firm-specific or market-level uncertainty. We test our hypotheses using data on both interlock and alliance networks for the 300 largest U.S. firms during the 1988\u20131993 period. The results provide some evidence that whether networks are stable or changing depends on the type of uncertainty experienced by firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0065","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['network', 'partners', 'uncertainty']","The article primarily focuses on interorganizational network dynamics and does not address social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We revisit the debate, re-examine the traditional rationales, and develop a set of new arguments for why the preferred objective function for the corporation must unambiguously continue to be the one that says \u201cmaximize shareholder value.\u201d We trace the origins of the debates from the late nineteenth century, their implications for accepted law and practice of corporate governance in the United States, and their reflection in shareholder versus stakeholder views in the organization studies literature and contractarian versus communitarian views in the legal literature. We address in detail possible critiques of the shareholder value maximization view. Although we recognize certain boundary constraints to our arguments, we conclude that the issues raised by such critiques and constraints are not unique to the shareholder value maximization view, but will exist even if the firm is managed on behalf of nonshareowning stakeholders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0068","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['shareholder value', 'stakeholder', 'corporate governance']","The article primarily focuses on the traditional corporate objective of maximizing shareholder value, with only a brief mention of stakeholder views, which does not strongly emphasize social justice or progressive themes.

Among the theories reviewed, two\u2014social presence and media richness\u2014are identified as problematic and as posing obstacles to future theoretical development. While shortcomings of these theories have been identified in the past, some of these theories' predictions have been supported by empirical evidence. It is argued that this theoretical dilemma can be resolved based upon principles derived from a modern version of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and the application of those principles to the understanding of human evolution. A new theoretical model called the psychobiological model is developed, which predicts variations in cognitive effort in computer-mediated collaborative tasks. The model proposes that there is a negative causal link between the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of a computer-mediated communication medium, which is the similarity of the medium to the face-to-face medium, and the cognitive effort required from an individual using the medium for knowledge transfer. The model also states that this link is counterbalanced by what are referred to as \u201cschema alignment\u201d and \u201ccognitive adaptation.\u201d The schema alignment construct refers to the similarity between the mental schemas of an individual and those of other participant(s). The cognitive adaptation construct refers to an individual's level of schema development associated with the use of a particular medium. Finally, the model states that the degree to which the medium supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in defining its naturalness, more so than the medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language. An example is offered of how the psychobiological model can be tested in the context provided by the customer support area of an online broker.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0071","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on theoretical models of communication without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In particular, social practice theory enables us to view resources in context as mutable sources of energy rather than as stable things that are independent of context, and to analyze the reciprocal relationship between actions and resources as they change. This approach to understanding resources requires an elaboration on current social practice theory and provides a new way to understand organizational change. This perspective is used to show how resources transform in unexpected ways as a result of change in organizational routines and how this transformation of resources makes resistance to change difficult to predict.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0073","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['social practice', 'organizational change', 'resources']","The article discusses resources in the context of social practice theory and organizational change, indicating a focus on the relational and contextual aspects of resources.

Because failures are inevitable in the experimentation process, we argue that conditions giving rise to psychological safety reduce fear of failure and promote experimentation. Based on this reasoning, we suggest that inconsistent organizational conditions\u2014when some support experimentation and others do not\u2014inhibit experimentation behaviors. An exploratory study in the field, followed by a laboratory experiment, found that individuals under high evaluative pressure were less likely to experiment when normative values and instrumental rewards were inconsistent in supporting experimentation. In contrast, individuals under low evaluative pressure responded to inconsistent conditions with increased experimentation. Our results suggest that evaluative pressure fundamentally alters an individual's experience of and response to uncertainty and that understanding experimentation behavior requires examining effects of multiple organizational conditions in combination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0076","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['psychological safety', 'experimentation', 'normative values']","The article discusses psychological safety and its impact on experimentation, which hints at ethical considerations in organizational behavior.

Grounding our research in the decision process literature, we introduce the concept of \u201ctoxic decision processes\u201d: organizational decision processes that generate widespread negative emotion in an organization through the recursive interplay of members' actions and negative emotions. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of six toxic decision processes to develop a model that describes the three phases\u2014inertia, detonation, and containment\u2014through which these processes unfold. Each phase is characterized by distinctive sets of interactions among decision makers and other organizational members, and by emotions such as anxiety, fear, shame, anger, and embarrassment, that shape and are shaped by these interactions. We show that toxic decision processes are triggered by issues that are sensitive, ambiguous, and nonurgent and identify several mechanisms that connect actors' emotions and actions, over time creating a toxic decision process that leads to the cumulative buildup and diffusion of toxicity. These mechanisms include the construction of a \u201cdanger zone\u201d around the issue that is avoided by all parties, the spread of negative emotion through processes of empathetic transmission and emotional contagion, and the suppression of widespread negative emotion that leads to the development of a volatile emotional context for future decision making. This study has important implications for the decision process literature, revealing how the different lenses through which decision making is usually viewed are connected by the emotionality that runs through each of them.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0070","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['emotion', 'organizational', 'toxic', 'decision processes']","The article discusses the emotional dynamics within organizational decision-making, which touches on ethical implications and the impact of negative emotions.

There has been relatively little analysis, however, of the extent to which firms learn how to use contracts to manage their interfirm relationships over time. In this paper, we conduct a detailed case study of a time series of 11 contracts concluded during 1989\u20131997 between the same two partners, both of whom participate in the personal computer industry, to explore whether and how firms learn to contract. We find many changes to the structure of the contracts that cannot be fully explained by changes in the assets at risk in the relationship, and evidence that these changes are largely the result of processes in which the firms were learning how to work together, including learning how to contract with each other. The nature of this learning appears to have been quite incremental and local, that is, not very far sighted. We suggest how and when contracts might serve as repositories for knowledge about how to govern collaborations, and suggest some boundary conditions for this phenomenon. Our findings also provide implications for the debate about whether contracts have a positive or negative effect on interorganizational trust.

Trustworthy behavior on the part of organizations is an important precondition for heightened employee effort and initiative.

Testing such models has been difficult in the past because of the difficulty of gathering data on relevant management and employee behaviors across a broad population of organizations. The current article uses data derived from a content analysis of the population of organizational ethnographies (N=204) to address this problem. The analysis verifies the existence of employment practices and management competence as separate factors. The effects of these factors on worker citizenship, employee-management conflict, and coworker relations are also evaluated. Supportive employment practices are an important precondition for worker citizenship.

We explore the relationship between trust and control in joint ventures and identify how these two critical concepts impact joint venture processes. We argue that trust, along with partner collaborative objectives, creates the initial climate that shapes partner interactions. In turn, these interactions lead to subsequent decisions about the nature of controls. We then examine linkages between alliance learning and the trust and control concepts, and argue that learning processes are central to evolving joint venture dynamics. Once the joint venture is formed, and if the initial conditions support continued collaboration, then learning processes will be central to evolving alliance dynamics. As initial conditions give way to evolved conditions, learning and trust will coevolve and impact decisions about control.

Although discussions of transactive memory theory suggest that components of the theory are dynamic, research tends to treat transactive memory as evolving linearly, using static measures rather than assessing development over time. In response, we offer a model emphasizing both linear and cyclical aspects of transactive memory development in work groups, and we propose that task is a major influence on developmental processes. We introduce task representation and the task-expertise-person (TEP) unit as basic constructs involved in transactive memory development, and we provide a dynamic model of how TEP units are constructed, evaluated, and utilized. Regarding observable changes over time, we propose that transactive memory systems can vary in terms of accuracy (the degree to which group members' perceptions about others' task-related expertise are accurate), sharedness (the degree to which members have a shared representation of the transactive memory system), and validation (the degree to which group members participate in the transactive memory system). Convergence is the optimal state of transactive memory systems and reflects high levels of accuracy, sharedness, and validation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0069","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['cognitive labor', 'efficiency', 'effectiveness']","The article discusses cognitive labor and group dynamics, which are relevant to organizational effectiveness but lacks a clear focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Yet, despite this recognition, there is much that is not understood about whether they complement or inhibit each other in affecting group performance, and whether group social and task conditions that foster one type of learning do so at the expense of the other. The findings from this field study of teams from four firms show that (1) local learning and distal learning are positively related to group efficiency and group innovativeness, respectively; (2) distal learning negatively interacts with local learning to impede group efficiency; and (3) high levels of group cohesion promote distal learning but diminish local learning. Overall, these findings suggest that there are not only performance trade-offs to engaging in either only local or distal learning, but also performance disadvantages to engaging in both types of group learning because distal learning impedes local learning from achieving a high level of group efficiency. In addition, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that tensions can arise from simultaneously managing both types of group learning because a high level of group cohesion increases distal learning but decreases local learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0080","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['group learning', 'performance', 'group cohesion']","The article discusses group learning processes and their impact on performance, but it lacks explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Multiple stakeholders were interviewed about an artifact of a large public transportation organization. Sense making of the artifact is shown to involve emotion in interpretations that consider three dimensions of the artifact\u2014instrumentality, aesthetics, and symbolism. Instrumentality relates to the tasks the artifact helps accomplish, aesthetics is the sensory reaction to the artifact, and symbolism regards associations the artifact elicits. The analysis demonstrates that sense making of these three dimensions includes unsolicited emotion both toward the artifact and toward the organization. Emotion that surfaces in sense making of organizational artifacts is, thus, suggested to be what links interpretation of artifacts and attitudes toward organizations.

Usually such costs are attributed to difficulties in measurement (the metering problem) or difficulties in redeploying assets to alternative uses (asset specificity). These variables are thought to be objective features of economic transactions. Rarely are the social-psychological dimensions of these objective features taken into account. Although economic transactions are fundamentally human activities, human behavior in the economics literature is usually reduced to such simplifying assumptions as shirking and bounded rationality.

However experts themselves may be prone to skewed decision making as the stability of their own industry environment changes and as their positioning within the industry shifts. We examine this possibility in the context of expert credit-rating agencies (\u201cagencies\u201d) and their risk ratings of emerging-market sovereign borrowers (\u201cratings\u201d) published from 1987 to 1998, a period that includes both industry stability (1987\u20131996) and industry turbulence set off by financial crises in several emerging-market countries (1997\u20131998). After controlling for macroeconomic and related objective risk factors linked to the sovereigns themselves, we find several points: (1) agency ratings during crisis-induced industry turbulence are negatively skewed, indicating undue pessimism among these experts, in line with decision-making perspectives predicting negative reaction by experts in an effort to retain legitimacy with salient stakeholders, in this case, investors and public regulators; (2) this negative shift is greater for incumbent firms and regionally focused firms, possibly because of the loss of previous informational advantages; and (3) this negative shift during crisis-induced turbulence is greater as industry rivalry among these experts increases in particular market segments, possibly indicating the development of competitive bandwagons among experts. Together, our results suggest that objective assessments by expert organizations are vulnerable to substantial distortion from the confluent effects of industry instability and expert positioning within the industry, particularly positioning affecting rivalry among experts. Ironically, experts may be most likely to mislead clients in unstable industry environments when experts command greater attention and should show greater fidelity to disinterested objectivity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0089","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['expert decision-making', 'industry turbulence', 'risk ratings']","The article discusses the potential biases in expert decision-making during crises, which touches on ethical considerations in organizational practices.

However, organizational researchers tend to ignore unanimous decision making, for example, because unanimity may be difficult to realize in large groups and may suffer from individual participants blocking decisions. This paper reconsiders unanimity rule in view of the development of circular systems for organizing decision making. It focuses on developing a theory of decision making under unanimity rule. The author uses a system dynamics model to explore the conditions under which unanimity rule supports the organization's ability to make decisions. Simulation experiments suggest that the dynamics and outcomes of unanimous decision making under and exceeding a critical threshold level of decision pressure are fundamentally different. Under this critical threshold, the decision-making system is capable of recovering from severe shocks to the system. If decision pressure is close to its threshold, a relatively small change can cause the decision process to collapse. In this respect, large groups operating under unanimity rule are less sustainable because they are more likely to exceed their critical threshold than small groups. Decomposing the decision-making system in small units, embedded in a hierarchical structure, therefore appears to be a necessary condition for sustainable performance in large organizations applying unanimity rule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0090","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['decision making', 'unanimity', 'sustainability']","The article primarily focuses on decision-making processes and organizational structures without significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search.

In the uncoordinated scenario, individual members of both supply chains maximize their own profits by individually selecting their service and inventory policies. In the coordinated scenario, wholesalers and retailers of each supply chain coordinate their service and inventory policy decisions to maximize supply chain profits. In the hybrid scenario, competition is between one coordinated and one uncoordinated supply chain. We discuss the derivation of the equilibrium service strategies, resulting inventory policies, and profits for each scenario, and compare the equilibria in a numerical study.

We investigate two very distinct types of arrangements between an assembler/retailer and its suppliers. One scheme is a vendor\u2010managed inventory with revenue sharing, and the other a wholesale\u2010price driven contract. In the VMI case, each supplier faces strategic uncertainty as to the amounts of components, which need to be mated with its own, that other suppliers will deliver.

When the retailer stocks out of a particular item, customers who prefer the item are likely, with some probability, to switch to a substitute product from another manufacturer at the same store. In such an event, a \u201clost sale\u201d for the manufacturer is not a \u201clost sale\u201d for the retailer. This exacerbates differences in manufacturer's and retailer's stockout costs for the item. Such differences in stockout cost influence the optimal contract between the manufacturer and the retailer and also impose agency costs on the channel. Such contracts, in turn, determine equilibrium inventory levels and fill rates. We study these issues in a single\u2010period supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, under three different scenarios (when the two firms are integrated into a single entity, when the retailer makes stocking decisions, and when the manufacturer makes stocking decisions). We compare, and present a methodology for comparing, stocking quantities, manufacturer efforts, and supply chain profits across different scenarios. We find that VMI performs better when manufacturer effort is a substantial driver of consumer demand and when consumers are unlikely to substitute to another brand in case of a stockout. On the other hand, if non\u2010contractible manufacturer effort is unimportant, or when substitution is significant, VMI can exacerbate, rather than mitigate, channel inefficiencies, and can perform worse than traditional Retailer Managed Inventory.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2004.tb00144.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory optimization without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Consequently, suppliers participating in an electronic market are likely to offer their capacity at a different price compared with traditional open market. We analyze this problem and derive the price\u2010capacity function for the supplier. We also derive a basis for allocating buyer's requirements among multiple suppliers so as to minimize his cost. Our model shows that suppliers with large capacities would quote a lower price in the electronic market. It also predicts that the unit bid price increases with bid quantity in the electronic market.

In order to solve the dynamic program for realistic problem sizes, a novel procedure for limiting the state space considered in the dynamic program is developed.

To test the theory, a model is derived in which the expected excess return on any risky asset is linearly related (via a collection of betas) to the expected excess return on the market portfolio and to the expected excess returns on the nonredundant options.

The literature predominantly resorts to a simple but suboptimal procedure that scales returns with predictive instruments and computes standard bounds using the original and scaled returns. This article provides a formal bridge between the two approaches. We propose an optimally scaled bound that coincides with the GHT bound when the first and second conditional moments are known. When these moments are misspecified, our optimally scaled bound yields a valid lower bound for the standard deviation of pricing kernels, whereas the GHT bound does not. We illustrate the behavior of the bounds using a number of linear and nonlinear models for consumption growth and bond and stock returns. We also illustrate how the optimally scaled bound can be used as a diagnostic for the specification of the first two conditional moments of asset returns.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/17/2/339/1576985","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing kernels and variance bounds without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

U.S. firms are under no obligation to disclose when they are trading, and generally report only quarterly changes in shares outstanding. We use 64 firms' supplementally disclosed repurchase trading data to provide the first examination of repurchase timing and execution. Across the days reported in our sample, firms adopted a variety of execution styles ranging from immediate intense repurchasing to delayed and smoothed repurchasing. We find no clear evidence that repurchases are timed to coincide with, precede, or follow, days on which information is released. We benchmark the costs and value of a given repurchase program against naive accumulation strategies achieving the same terminal portfolio. While there is considerable variation across the firms, NYSE firms on average beat their benchmarks, whereas NASDAQ firms do not. Finally, we document the liquidity impact of open market repurchases. We find that repurchasing contributes to market liquidity by narrowing bid-ask spreads and attenuating the price impact of order imbalances on days when repurchase trades are completed.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/17/2/463/1576952","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of open market repurchases without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We implement the models using a sample of 182 bond prices from firms with simple capital structures during the period 1986\u20131997. The conventional wisdom is that structural models do not generate spreads as high as those seen in the bond market, and true to expectations, we find that the predicted spreads in our implementation of the Merton model are too low. However, most of the other structural models predict spreads that are too high on average. Nevertheless, accuracy is a problem, as the newer models tend to severely overstate the credit risk of firms with high leverage or volatility and yet suffer from a spread underprediction problem with safer bonds. The Leland and Toft model is an exception in that it overpredicts spreads on most bonds, particularly those with high coupons. More accurate structural models must avoid features that increase the credit risk on the riskier bonds while scarcely affecting the spreads of the safest bonds.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/17/2/499/1576997","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on empirical testing of structural models of corporate bond pricing without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Both uniform and discriminatory auctions are studied and bidders can submit multiple bids. We show that bidders with short and long preauction positions have different valuations in an otherwise common value setting. Discriminatory auctions lead to more short squeezing and higher revenue than uniform auctions, ceteris paribus.

Despite the widespread use of these auctions, the extant theory shows that they are susceptible to arbitrarily large underpricing. We make a realistic modification to the theory by letting prices, quantities, and bids be discrete. We show that underpricing can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small price tick size and a sufficiently large quantity multiple. We also show how one might improve revenues by modifying the allocation rule. A trivial change in the design can have a dramatic impact on prices.

Thus book building can drive auction-method offerings from the market even if it yields no aggregate benefit. Compared to the auction regime, book building reduces issue costs for large issuers.

A new feature of our model is that when perturbed by unexpected returns, investors become temporarily more sensitive to news. Gradually investors become accustomed to the new level of wealth, restoring prior levels of risk aversion and news sensitivity. The state-dependent sensitivity to news creates the type of volatility clustering found in low-frequency stock returns.

In accordance with max-min expected utility, a robust investor insures against some endogenous worst case. I first show that robustness dramatically decreases the demand for equities and is observationally equivalent to recursive preferences when removing wealth effects. Unlike standard recursive preferences, however, robustness leads to environment-specific \u201ceffective\u201d risk aversion. As an extension, I present a closed-form solution for the portfolio problem of a robust Duffie-Epstein-Zin investor. Finally, robustness increases the equilibrium equity premium and lowers the risk-free rate.

In this paper, we take stock of the large body of extant research and provide a systematic assessment of empirical evidence. In all, 308 statistical tests from 63 articles, selected according to a set of clear criteria, were examined across various dimensions. We assess not only the level of empirical support for the theory, but also the degree of paradigm consensus present in the empirical literature. Our analysis shows that results are mixed: while we found support in some areas (e.g., with regard to asset specificity), we also found considerable disagreement on how to operationalize some of TCE's central constructs and propositions, and relatively low levels of empirical support in other core areas (e.g., surrounding uncertainty and performance). We conclude that a more thorough empirical grounding of the theory's foundation is crucial to its future development, and offer several strategies for doing this.

However, most of this work examines the impact of firm-specific resources on the overall performance of a firm. In this paper it is argued that, in some circumstances, adopting the effectiveness of business processes as a dependent variable may be more appropriate than adopting overall firm performance as a dependent variable. This idea is tested by examining the determinants of the effectiveness of the customer service business process in a sample of North American insurance companies. Results are consistent with resource-based expectations, and they show that distinctive advantages observable at the process level are not necessarily reflected in firm level performance. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed along with a discussion of the relationship between resources and capabilities, on the one hand, and business processes, activities, and routines, on the other.

We find that the management of product variety through the way different application categories are integrated in products and the platforms on which these products are offered can be as important as the significance of scope economies at the more aggregated firm level. Specifically, we find that there is little evidence of firm benefits from economies of scope in production, but there is substantial evidence that products benefit from economies of scope in consumption. In addition, we find that firms with products that encapsulate more application categories perform better, and those with products that cover more computing platforms perform worse. Finally, changes in product variety through new product introductions improve firm performance, but extensions to existing products hinder the performance of the firm and the product. We conclude that research in scope economies can benefit from a more detailed model of the evolution of product variety that includes data and analysis at the firm level and at the product level.

Toward an understanding of the relationship between academic quality and practical relevance","In this paper, we propose a positive relationship between the academic quality and practical relevance of management research. The basis for this is the idea that academicians and practitioners both value research that is interesting and justified\u2014meaning research that challenges and extends existing beliefs and research that offers compelling evidence for its conclusions. We acknowledge that there are likely to be many cases where academicians and practitioners disagree on what is interesting and justified. We argue, however, that there are also likely to be cases where the judgments of the two groups converge. Results from a stratified, random sample of 120 publications are consistent with this argument\u2014showing a positive correlation between an objective measure of an article's academic quality and expert panel ratings of its practical relevance.

Combining predictions from control theory, escalation of commitment, and goal theory, we seek to explain how leaders' cognitions shape the formation of novel responses to the value-laden issue of corporate greening. We propose an iterative model that links leaders' principles with corporate actions and test it using survey data gathered from 360 firms. The model views strategy organically, as a set of adaptive goals and behaviors, and highlights the role of systemic and local feedback loops in strategy formation. We find that top executives who champion new strategic initiatives monitor early success or failure, and adjust their efforts to match early performance feedback. Perceptions of satisfactory performance strengthen leaders' efforts towards their initial target, while perceptions of unsatisfactory performance diminish them. This feedback relationship is invariant throughout favorable or unfavorable expectancies of success, contrary to the contingent prediction of control theory. The model also examines how top-down and bottom-up strategic initiatives combine to help firms maintain a positive momentum of change when champions' efforts decline in the face of premature failure signals.

Longitudinal data on 227 firms that diversify between 1980 and 1992 reveal that the sample firms invest less in R&D and have greater breadth of technology (based on patent citations) than their industry peers prior to the diversification event. Also, acquiring firms may appear to have lower performance because of accounting conventions and because firms that use internal growth rather than acquisition pursue less extensive diversification.

In this paper we begin with the observation that firms often simultaneously invest in multiple exploration projects. We identify two sources of potential interactions among these real options investments. First, we investigate the effects of correlations between the outcomes in different options. Second, we analyze the effects of investments that are fungible across project options. We show that under different conditions multiple options can be sub-additive (due to redundancies in outcomes) or super-additive (due to fungible inputs). We test the implications of our model with data from the biotech industry and find supporting evidence. Our model and results have some interesting implications for the exploration literature and real options lens.

However, the market reacts more positively to downsizing actions when reallocation strategies are used and to large downsizing actions when disengagement incentives are applied.

The additive and integrative effects of the first two have not been explored. The benefits of market structuration remain untheorized and thus untested. The test of our theoretical model in the Canadian general insurance industry indicates that mutual forbearance provides advantage under specified conditions, that market structuration also provides advantages, but that diversification per se does not.

In the resource-based view of the firm, human capital is frequently assumed to contribute to competitive advantage due to its inimitability based on its intangible, firm-specific, and socially complex nature. Consistent with this view, we find that investments in firm-specific human capital have a significant impact on learning and firm performance. More specifically, human capital selection (education requirements and screening), development through training, and deployment significantly improve learning by doing, which in turn improves performance. However, we find that acquiring human capital with prior industry experience from external sources significantly reduces learning performance. We also find that firms with high turnover significantly underperform their rivals, revealing the time-compression diseconomies that protect firm-specific human capital from imitation. These results provide new empirical evidence of the inimitability of human capital.

In our model, the acquiring firm decides both how much to integrate the acquired firm and the extent to which it replaces this firm's top management team. It can also learn to manage the post-acquisition integration process by tacitly accumulating acquisition experience and explicitly codifying it in manuals, systems, and other acquisition-specific tools. Using a sample of 228 acquisitions in the U.S. banking industry, we find that knowledge codification strongly and positively influences acquisition performance, while experience accumulation does not. Furthermore, increasing levels of post-acquisition integration strengthen the positive effect of codification. Finally, the level of integration between the two merged firms significantly enhances performance, while replacing top managers in the acquired firm negatively impacts performance, all else being equal. Implications are drawn for both organizational learning theory and a knowledge-based approach to corporate strategy research.

Some of this debate has focused on the pros and cons of related vs. unrelated diversification. A standard explanation of the benefits of related diversification has to do with the ability to obtain intra-temporal economies of scope from contemporaneous sharing of resources by related businesses within the firm. In contrast, this paper deals with inter-temporal economies of scope that firms achieve by redeploying resources and capabilities between related businesses over time, as firms exit some markets while entering others. The transfer of resources due to market exit distinguishes our treatment of inter-temporal economies of scope from standard intra-temporal economies of scope. In addition, these inter-temporal economies can benefit from a decentralized and modular organizational structure. This ability to obtain inter-temporal economies of scope via organizational modularity and recombination suggests that corporations do not necessarily need a high degree of coordination between business units in order to benefit from a strategy of related diversification.

We have yet to see large-sample studies demonstrating how organizational elements, independently, complementarily and interactively, may or may not enhance the organization's performance. Moreover, little attention has been given to researching this topic in public sector organizations. The present study aims to bridge this gap by examining the impact of a set of independent intangible organizational elements and the interactions among them on a set of objective organizational performance measures in a sample of local government authorities in Israel. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that organizational performance (measured by self-income ratio, collecting efficiency ratio, employment rate, and municipal development) can be well explained by six intangible organizational elements (managerial capabilities, human capital, internal auditing, labor relations, organizational culture, and perceived organizational reputation) and the interactions among them, which need to be taken into account in any cost effective development.

The operationalization proposed here is a twofold approach. First, the RBV may be enhanced by the explicit recognition of Penrose's two classes of resources, namely, administrative resources and productive resources. This distinction suggests a focus on the administrative decisions of managers that lead to economic performance. Second, we argue that the RBV is a theory about extraordinary performers or outliers\u2014not averages. Therefore, the statistical methods used in applying the theory must account for individual firm differences, and not be based on means, which statistically neutralize firm differences. We propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical methodology to examine the relationship between administrative decisions and economic performance over time. We develop and explain a measure of competitive advantage that goes beyond comparisons of economic performance. This Bayesian methodology allows us to make meaningful probability statements about specific, individual firms and the effects of the administrative decisions examined in this study.

To account for this behavior, I develop a game theoretic model involving three players: the former monopoly, its home government, and the host government of the country into which the firm wants to enter. I show first that there are in fact different asymmetric strategies that former monopolies can use in such a setting, and that a global strategy cannot always be implemented by those firms because of cooperation issues between the two governments. I also study the conditions under which these issues can be solved and show that this can happen only when the firm develops a political strategy that integrates both defensive and offensive activities. Overall, this paper therefore argues that asymmetric strategies are not always adopted to maintain monopoly rents but are also dictated by the nature of the international relationships between the governments involved.

Specifically, we examine the tension between the option to defer, which discourages entry in the presence of uncertainty, and the option to grow, which may encourage entry in the presence of uncertainty when there are early mover advantages. Empirical analysis on data from a broad array of industries revealed that the effect of uncertainty on entry is not monotonic. Our findings are the first to find support for the nonmonotonic effect of uncertainty that has only recently emerged in theoretical treatments of real options theory, and amplify the importance of considering both the option to defer and the option to grow when contemplating entry. Furthermore, we found evidence that the relationship between uncertainty and entry is moderated by: (a) irreversibility, which influences the value of the option to defer; (b) the total value of growth opportunities; and (c) early mover advantages, which magnify the value of growth options.

At the firm level, particular attention is given to strategy effects. Based on a modification of Porter's typology, these effects are captured through different forms of both \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018hybrid\u2019 strategies. Industry effects are represented using industry concentration, entry barriers, and growth. Hypotheses are developed taking into account both previous research and the particular idiosyncrasies of the national context. The results obtained provide important insights on specific determinants of firm profitability. With respect to strategy, results confirm the hypothesis that hybrid strategies are clearly preferable compared to pure ones. In addition, it was found that the more generic strategy dimensions are included in the strategy mix, the more profitable the strategy is, provided that one of the key ingredients is low cost. Industry-level effects, although weaker, show strong impact of industry entry barriers. Moreover, the findings suggest that while both sets of factors significantly contribute to firm profitability, firm-specific factors explain more than twice as much profit variability as industry factors.

Information asymmetry increases the risks of both adverse selection and moral hazard. When traditional differentiators of firm quality are lacking, such as in emerging economic sectors, markets may turn to secondary information sources to filter and sort firms. We investigate the roles played by observable corporate governance characteristics as indirect indicators of new firms' potential qualitative differences. Markets may sort firms based on such characteristics because they are perceived to be correlated with desired but unobservable characteristics and actions and they lower the risks of both adverse selection and moral hazard. Our study of publicly traded U.S. Internet firms found that firm market valuation was strongly associated with corporate governance characteristics (e.g., executive and director stock-based incentives, institutional and blockholder stock ownership, board structure, and venture capital participation). In addition, firm age moderated how markets used some quality proxies to determine firm valuation during the post-IPO period.

There is, however, little conceptual or theoretical literature on the determinants of outcome patterns in these contests. This paper offers a first attempt at systematic and parsimonious conceptualization of the issue. In Brazil, for instance, while U.S.-based MNEs such as Coca-Cola and IBM lead in their sectors, other leading U.S. MNEs including Citibank, GE, and Pfizer are outsold by European rivals that appear less competitive globally. Extending theory on the liability of foreignness and firm-specific advantages, we contend that (i) the MNE whose home nation has greater ties to the focal host nation (along geographic, colonial, immigration, linguistic, and institutional dimensions) will lead in that host nation; and (ii) ties notwithstanding, if an MNE's firm-specific advantages are so superior that it outsells a rival MNE in that rival's home market, then it will outsell that rival as well in the focal host market. Based on this we develop a conceptual framework, statistical analysis pertaining to MNE competition in Brazil, and three avenues for fruitful new research.

This study addresses this void in the literature by examining the issue of restructuring in the newly emerging economy of the Czech Republic. Several hypotheses relating to internal and external markets in emerging institutional environments are developed and tested using a large database of original and restructured Czech firms undergoing privatization. After controlling for factors such as size and performance, it is found that restructuring significantly reduced the value of firms, despite the general belief that Czech firms emerging from the communist era were highly overdiversified. This finding, while contradicting a majority of the work on restructured firms in the United States, nonetheless supports the notion that sizeable internal markets play an enhanced role in underdeveloped institutional environments.

Two studies were conducted to test this general hypothesis. First, an archival study demonstrated that the stock of companies headed by charismatic leaders appreciated more than the stock of comparable companies, even after differences in corporate performance were controlled. It was also found that the effect of charismatic leadership was heightened under more difficult economic conditions. Second, an experiment was conducted in which the salience of charismatic leadership was manipulated, along with information about the prospects for an organization's turnaround. Results showed that appeals from a charismatic leader led to increased investment in the firm, and the leader's influence was greater when the prospects for an organizational turnaround were more difficult. It was also found that an endowment of stock enhanced the influence of charismatic appeals and that charismatic leadership may have affected the general risk propensities of followers. These findings were interpreted in terms of an external perspective on leadership, illustrating how leaders can manage the firm's economic and social environment.

Researchers have investigated how managers may develop absorptive capacity by building internal knowledge stocks, but few have focused on the distribution of this knowledge within the firm and the role managers play in administering information to organizational subunits. In this paper, we explore the degree to which managers can develop absorptive capacity by directly providing information to agents in the organization that might potentially adopt a new practice. We find that the effectiveness of managerial information provision depends on the degree to which potential adopters have information from other sources. We find that information from previous adopters and past events reduces the effect of information provision, while experience with related practices amplifies it. Our research helps clarify when absorptive capacity may provide a sustained competitive advantage.

In this study, we depart from the usual debates regarding the superiority of one governance structure over another and argue that performance differences between these two alternative governance structures may be attributable more to the matching of one structure with a correspondingly appropriate strategy. Specifically, we posit that stores will act in fit-enhancing ways by pursuing strategies that are more congruent with their governance structure; i.e., that franchised stores, with their more flexible and decentralized structures, will be more likely to pursue strategies that emphasize flexibility and local adaptation, whereas company-owned stores will tend to pursue strategies that emphasize predictability and control. We also argue that those stores acting in such a manner will enjoy subsequent performance benefits. We develop these ideas around strategy/governance structure fit and test our hypotheses using longitudinal data from over 6000 stores within one of the biggest U.S. restaurant chains from 1991 to 1997.

We find that showing consideration for employees' morale and welfare during downsizing is positively related both to perceived success of downsizing and to financial performance following layoffs. Advance notice of layoffs is positively related to subsequent financial performance, but the provision of extended insurance to laid-off employees is negatively related to financial performance. Planned redesign of work structures is positively related to perceived success, but has neutral to negative effects on financial performance.

What leads to the practice of appointing outside directors in the absence of legal mandate? This article addresses these two important questions by drawing not only on agency theory, but also resource dependence and institutional theories. Taking advantage of China's institutional transitions, our findings, based on an archival database covering 405 publicly listed firms and 1211 company\u2013years, suggest that outsider directors do make a difference in firm performance, if such performance is measured by sales growth, and that they have little impact on financial performance such as return on equity (ROE). The results also document a bandwagon effect behind the diffusion of the practice of appointing outsiders to corporate boards. The article not only highlights the need to incorporate multiple theories beyond agency theory in corporate governance research, but also generates policy implications in light of the recent trend toward having more outside directors on corporate boards in emerging economies.

While prior work has demonstrated a relationship between network structure and managerial performance, inadequate attention has been paid to network content. We consider several micro-social processes that might account for differences in managerial performance, taken from economic sociology and studies of managers' exploitation of their social networks and derived from work in psychology on the genesis of ideas. We compare the influence of these mechanisms on managerial performance using a sample of 106 middle managers in a European telecommunications company. Our findings suggest that, while network structure matters, access to heterogeneous knowledge is of equal importance for overall managerial performance and of greater importance for innovation performance.

In the model developed here, journalists celebrate a CEO whose firm takes strategic actions that are distinctive and consistent by attributing such actions and performance to the firm's CEO. In so doing, journalists over-attribute a firm's actions and outcomes to the disposition of its CEO rather than to broader situational factors. A CEO who internalizes such celebrity will also tend to believe this over-attribution and become overconfident about the efficacy of her past actions and future abilities.

The focus on subsidiaries is especially interesting since they are simultaneously embedded in two knowledge contexts: (a) the internal multinational corporation (MNC) comprised of the headquarters and other subsidiaries; and (b) an external environment of regional or host country firms. We develop hypotheses to suggest that the extent of influences of these contexts on subsidiary technological innovation depends on the characteristics of the knowledge network (technological richness and diversity) and the knowledge linkages of the subsidiary with other entities. The study uses patent citation data pertaining to innovations by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. semiconductor firms to test these hypotheses.

Prior research suggests that choosing an appropriate organizational form or governance structure is an important mechanism in achieving a balance between these potentially competing concerns. This does not exhaust the set of possible mechanisms available to alliance partners, however. In this paper we explore an alternative response to hazards of R&D cooperation: reduction of the \u2018scope\u2019 of the alliance. We argue that when partner firms are direct competitors in end product or strategic resource markets even \u2018protective\u2019 governance structures such as equity joint ventures may provide insufficient protection to induce extensive knowledge sharing among alliance participants.

Using a large-scale panel database of the foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based MNCs in above-average R&D-intensive industries, we examine the extent to which external spillover opportunities as well as internal firm-specific capabilities to utilize such knowledge affect MNCs' new R&D location decisions. Our findings suggest that MNCs appear to anticipate potential spillover opportunities and are discriminating in assessing these opportunities not only across locations but also across categories of competitors within the same location. Further, our findings provide stronger support to predictions regarding the salience of global utilization capacity than they do to predictions regarding the salience of local utilization capacity.

Moving from single to interdependent explanations","This paper explores the relationships among four fundamental determinants of intrafirm competence transfers that have hitherto been analyzed only separately: formal organization structure, informal relations, geographical distance, and relatedness of competencies across subsidiaries. Using a data set consisting of 4840 dyads between new product development teams and subsidiaries that were potential targets for competence transfers in a high-technology multinational company, we find that these determinants interact in surprising ways to explain different patterns of transfers. Results revealed that teams preferred to approach people they knew rather than people who knew related technologies well. They also showed that teams steered away from spatially distant subsidiaries that had related competencies and that the negative effect of large spatial distances could be overcome through established informal relations. These findings indicate that studying one of the determinants separately can yield biased results, as their net effect may change when the moderating effects of the other determinants are considered. Research on synergies, integration, technology transfers, and geographical and cultural differentiation in multinational enterprises therefore needs to be broadened by analyzing multiple determinants of competence transfers.

To do this successfully, it requires technological knowledge, the ability to combine knowledge elements into valuable new products, and the complementary assets that facilitate the manufacturing, sales, and distribution of those products. We argue that these all develop as a function of a firm's experience in its technological and product-market domains. Moreover, given the prospect of complementarities among technological and product-market experience, the value of any one type of experience may be enhanced by the presence of another. Therefore, new products will be more successful when a firm possesses the appropriate stocks of technological and product-market experience. We test this idea by analyzing whether pharmaceutical firms' experience in their technological and product-market domains confer early advantages to their new product offerings, and lead to higher initial sales levels.

Effective implementation is essential to making these acquisitions successful, yet prior research on the implementation process has yielded paradoxical findings. I argue that a closer examination of the role of the acquired managers helps to resolve the implementation dilemmas found in prior research, which has focused on the role of the acquiring firm. I use grounded theory-building techniques to examine the integration of eight technology acquisitions, and find that acquired managers play a key role in achieving two types of value: expected and serendipitous. In promoting the realization of these two types of value, acquired leaders maintain the advantages of both integration and autonomy. Moreover, these leaders enable their organizations to simultaneously experience two often-conflicting forms of change: exploration and exploitation.

During these two decades, the Japanese domestic environment for pharmaceuticals changed radically, encouraging a \u2018bubble\u2019 of trivial innovations. Experience by Japanese firms in their domestic market predominantly determined their innovative capabilities, pushing these firms towards trivial innovation. Corporate experience in the socially \u2018proximate\u2019 markets of Southern Europe served as a strategic complement for significant innovation by Japanese drug firms, and thus as a partial counterweight to the home market. Unfortunately, corporate diversification was a strategic substitute for significant innovation, and many Japanese drug firms are significantly diversified. The resulting degradation of innovative capability for Japanese drug firms has locked most of them into an increasingly unattractive home market.

Because earnings forecasts are linked to value and recommendations reflect analysts' opinions of value relative to current price, earnings forecasts and stock recommendations should be linked in a predictable manner. I consider four possible valuation models of how earnings forecasts and stock recommendations are linked. These models include two specifications of the residual income model, a price\u2010earnings\u2010to\u2010growth (PEG) model, and analysts' projections of long\u2010term earnings growth. The results provide little evidence that analysts' recommendations are explained by either residual income model specification. However, both the PEG model and analysts' projections of long\u2010term earnings growth explain analysts' stock recommendations. The relation between the valuation models and future returns is also examined. Analysts' projections of long\u2010term earnings growth have the greatest explanatory power for stock recommendations, but investment strategies based on these projections have the least association with future excess returns. Overall, the evidence suggests that analysts' recommendations are more correlated with heuristic valuation models than with present value models, and buy\u2010and\u2010hold investors would earn higher returns relying on present value models that incorporate analysts' earnings forecasts than on analysts' recommendations.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/1/25/2737/How-Do-Analysts-Use-Their-Earnings-Forecasts-in","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings forecasts and stock recommendations without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

The relatively greater degree of dispersion in auditor choice (between Big 5 and non\u2010Big 5 auditors) in our large sample of privately held audit clients allows us to predict the auditor choice for each firm and to control for potential self\u2010selection. We reject the null hypothesis that clients are randomly allocated across Big 5 and non\u2010Big 5 auditors. Using standard OLS regressions, we document a Big 5 premium; however this premium vanishes once we control for self\u2010selection bias. Moreover, we find that client firms choosing Big 5 auditors generally would have faced higher fees had they chosen non\u2010Big 5 auditors, given their firm\u2010specific characteristics. Our results are consistent with audit markets for private firms being segmented along cost\u2010effective lines.

These estimates are compared with estimates of the expected rate of return implied by commonly used heuristics\u2014viz., the PEG ratio and the PE ratio. Proponents of the PEG ratio (which is the price\u2010earnings [PE] ratio divided by the short\u2010term earnings growth rate) argue that this ratio takes account of differences in short\u2010run earnings growth, providing a ranking that is superior to the ranking based on PE ratios. But even though the PEG ratio may provide an improvement over the PE ratio, it is arguably still too simplistic because it implicitly assumes that the short\u2010run growth forecast also captures the long\u2010run future. I provide a means of simultaneously estimating the expected rate of return and the rate of change in abnormal growth in earnings beyond the (short) forecast horizon\u2014thereby refining the PEG ratio ranking. The method may also be used by researchers interested in determining the effects of various factors (such as disclosure quality, cross\u2010listing, etc.) on the cost of equity capital. Although the correlation between the refined estimates and estimates of the expected rate of return implied by the PEG ratio is high, supporting the use of the PEG ratio as a parsimonious way to rank stocks, the estimates of the expected rate of return based on the PEG ratio are biased downward. This correlation is much lower and the downward bias is much larger for estimates of the expected rate of return based on the PE ratio.

The tests provide evidence certain U.K. managers opportunistically measure deferred taxes to manage leverage, consistent with arguments by commentators that deferred taxes heavily influence leverage indicators that play a prominent role in the U.K. contracting framework. Because the proper identification and measurement of both operational and opportunistic determinants of unrecognized deferred taxes influence our tests, we additionally investigate whether unrecognized taxes relate to future deferred tax reversals and future operating profitability of the firm. These tests show the components of deferred taxes predict both future deferred tax reversals and indicators of future profitability of the firm as predicted. Taken together, our results indicate that, on average, the existence of balance sheet management does not nullify the predictive power of (unrecognized) deferred taxes for future deferred tax reversals and for profitability measures.

In order to be capitalized, an asset should be associated with future economic benefits. The existing environmental literature suggests that investors condition their evaluation of the future economic benefits arising from environmental capital expenditure on an assessment of the firms' environmental performance. This literature predicts the emergence of two environmental stereotypes: low\u2010polluting firms that overcomply with existing environmental regulations, and high\u2010polluting firms that just meet minimal environmental requirements. Our valuation evidence indicates that there are incremental economic benefits associated with environmental capital expenditure investment by low\u2010polluting firms but not high\u2010polluting firms.

We find that a new variable, operating cash flows measured as earnings adjusted for depreciation and working capital accruals, scaled by price (CFO/P) captures mispricing attributed to the four traditional value\u2010glamour proxies and accruals. Interpretation of this finding depends on the reader's priors. If the reader believes that value\u2010glamour phenomenon can be operationalized only as C/P, and not CFO/P, then one would conclude that CFO/P is a parsimonious variable that captures the mispricing attributes of two distinct anomalies, value glamour and accruals. However, if a reader views the value\u2010glamour anomaly broadly as a fundamentals\u2010to\u2010price anomaly, then (1) the CFO/P variable can be considered an expanded value\u2010glamour proxy and; (2) our results are consistent with Beaver's (2002) conjecture that the accruals anomaly is the glamour stock phenomenon in disguise.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/2/355/2798/Value-Glamour-and-Accruals-Mispricing-One-Anomaly","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial anomalies and technical aspects of accounting without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Based on restatements of current tax expense adjusted for the tax benefits of stock options, the evidence indicates that many firms included the overstated financial accounting income on their tax returns, thus overpaying their taxes in the process of inflating their accounting earnings. We estimate that the median firm sacrificed eight cents in additional income taxes per dollar of inflated pretax earnings. In aggregate, we estimate that the firms in our sample paid $320 million in taxes on overstated earnings of about $3.36 billion.

First, the findings suggest that subjective bonuses are used to complement perceived weaknesses in quantitative performance measures and to provide employees insurance against downside risk in their pay. Specifically, use of subjective bonuses is positively related to: (1) the extent of long\u2010term investments in intangibles; (2) the extent of organizational interdependencies; (3) the extent to which the achievability of the formula bonus target is both difficult and leads to significant consequences if not met; and (4) the presence of an operating loss.

The second is the length of time between when the asset is placed into service and when the DTL associated with that asset begins to reverse. The paper shows that a decrease in the time it takes for the DTL to begin to reverse is neither necessary nor sufficient for the value of the DTL to increase. It also shows that the value of the DTL is not equal to the present value of the future deferred tax expense. The effect of one dollar of DTL on firm value depends only on the tax depreciation rate and the discount rate.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/2/437/2751/The-Valuation-Relevance-of-Reversing-Deferred-Tax","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of deferred tax liabilities without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We find that the change to EDGAR filings results in significant increases in the volume of small, but not large trades, during the five\u2010day window (\u2060\u22121, 3) around the filing date. While our data does not allow us to directly examine the trading profits and transactions costs of investors, we are able to examine whether the trading patterns reflect information available in the 10\u2010K differently in the pre\u2010 and post\u2010EDGAR period. Using stock return as a proxy for the information content of the 10\u2010K, our results show that post\u2010EDGAR small trades are more likely to reflect that information, i.e., more likely than in the pre\u2010EDGAR period to be buys (sells) when returns in the five\u2010day window after the trade are positive (negative). We also find that while the product of the net buys (sells) and the price change over the five\u2010day window after the trade for small trades in the post\u2010EDGAR period is still less than that for large trades, the difference between the two groups decreased significantly. Consequently, while we cannot directly examine the profitability of these transactions, the evidence presented is consistent with EDGAR improving the trading outcomes of small vis\u2010a`\u2010vis large investors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/571/2784/Differential-Response-of-Small-versus-Large","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['small investors', 'large investors', 'trading patterns']","The article discusses the differential impact of EDGAR filings on small versus large investors, which touches on equity in trading outcomes but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Assuming that a firm decouples its internal transfer price from the arm's length price used for tax purposes, we analyze the effectiveness of alternative pricing rules under both cost\u2010 and market\u2010based transfer pricing. In a tax\u2010free world, Hirshleifer (1956) advocated that the internal transfer price be set equal to the marginal cost of the supplying division. Extending this solution, we argue that the optimal internal transfer price should be a weighted average of the pre\u2010tax marginal cost and the most favorable arm's length price. When the supplying division also sells the intermediate product in question to outside parties, the external price becomes a natural candidate for the arm's length price. We argue that for internal performance evaluation purposes firms should generally not value internal transactions at the prevailing market price if the supplying division has monopoly power in the external market. By imposing intracompany discounts, firms can alleviate attendant double marginalization problems and, at the same time, realize tax savings due to differences in income tax rates. Our analysis characterizes optimal intracompany discounts as a function of the market parameters and the divisional tax rates.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/591/2809/Integrating-Managerial-and-Tax-Objectives-in","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of transfer pricing and tax strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The recently passed Regulation FD (Reg FD) requires firms to make material disclosures broadly available. Using a sample of firms that previously restricted access to conference calls and a sample of firms that voluntarily allowed unlimited access to their calls in the pre\u2010Reg FD period, we examine the effect of the new rule on managers' decisions regarding the timing, use, and information content of calls, as well as the effect on investors' trading behavior during the call. Our results indicate that Reg FD had a significant negative impact on managers' decisions to continue hosting conference calls and on their decisions regarding the optimal time to hold the call. However, contrary to the concerns of many critics, the magnitudes of these changes are not large. We do not find evidence that Reg FD decreased the amount of information disclosed during the call period, contrary to the concerns of Reg FD opponents. Finally, we find evidence that the new rule increased price volatility for firms that previously restricted access to their calls (relative to firms that previously held open calls) and that the amount of individual investor trading increased following the rule change. Overall, our results suggest that Reg FD impacted trading during the conference call window for firms most affected by the new regulation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/617/2779/Managerial-and-Investor-Responses-to-Disclosure","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['regulation', 'disclosure', 'information']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of regulation and its impact on managerial decisions and investor behavior, with no significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We show that the Chinese regulators appear to have scrutinized firms using excess amounts of nonoperating income to reach the 10 percent hurdle. In addition, their ability to do so seems to have improved over time, which allows them to be better able to identify firms that subsequently performed better. However, many firms were still able to gain rights issue approval through excess nonoperating income.

In the experiment, participants developed stock price assessments after reviewing background financial information and a current earnings announcement for a company. The earnings announcement was manipulated to report only GAAP earnings in one condition and both pro forma and GAAP earnings in the other condition. Consistent with empirical evidence, the pro forma earnings in our experiment exceeded GAAP earnings. The results indicate that nonprofessional investors who received an earnings announcement that contained both pro forma and GAAP disclosures assessed a higher stock price than did nonprofessionals who received an announcement containing only GAAP disclosures. Financial analysts' stock price judgments were not affected by the pro forma disclosures. Followup analyses suggest that analysts and nonprofessional investors used different valuation models and information processing. Analysts used well\u2010defined valuation models, based on either earnings\u2010multiples or cash flows, while the nonprofessional investors were more likely to use simpler, heuristic\u2010based valuation models. The pro forma disclosure did not cause nonprofessional investors to assess a higher earnings number for determining a stock price, but rather caused nonprofessionals to perceive the earnings announcement as more favorable, which in turn caused them to convert earnings or some other performance metric into a higher stock price. This effect appears to be due to unintentional cognitive effects, rather than nonprofessionals relying on pro forma earnings information because they perceived it to be informative.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/667/2769/The-Effects-of-Pro-Forma-Earnings-Disclosures-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial disclosures and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a sample of 249 press releases from 1997\u201399, we find that firms with low GAAP earnings informativeness are more likely to disclose pro forma earnings than other firms. We also find that strategic considerations, measured using the direction of GAAP earnings surprises, are an important determinant of pro forma reporting. In addition, our examination of the relative and incremental information content of pro forma earnings shows that investors find pro forma earnings to be more useful when GAAP earnings informativeness is low or when strategic considerations are absent. Tests of the predictive ability of pro forma earnings for future profitability and returns are mixed, and we therefore cannot conclusively determine whether the investor reaction to pro forma earnings at the time of the press release is consistent with market efficiency or mispricing. The paper contributes to the growing literature on pro forma earnings and more generally to the literature on voluntary and strategic disclosure.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/769/2795/Earnings-Informativeness-and-Strategic-Disclosure","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings reporting and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Responding to calls for enhanced reporting of these items, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long\u2010Lived Assets. However, its effect on the characteristics of reported write\u2010offs remains unclear, as implementation requires inherently subjective estimates. Further, critics (including dissenting FASB board members and the SEC) question the standard's guidance. Motivated in part by this debate, this paper contrasts the characteristics of write\u2010offs reported prior versus subsequent to the issuance of SFAS No. 121. Empirical results reveal that economic factors have a weaker association with write\u2010offs reported after SFAS No. 121. This is consistent across macro, industry, and firm\u2010specific variables. Results also indicate a higher association between write\u2010offs and \u201cbig bath\u201d reporting behavior after the standard's implementation, and that this \u201cbig bath\u201d behavior more likely reflects opportunistic reporting by managers rather than the provision of their private information. These inferences are robust to a number of alternative specifications and variable definitions. Overall, the results suggest the reporting of write\u2010offs under SFAS No. 121 has decreased in quality, consistent with criticisms of the standard.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/3/823/2749/An-Examination-of-Long-Lived-Asset-Impairments","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['reporting', 'impairment', 'subjective', 'critics']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting standards and does not emphasize social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

There has been a conspicuous absence of modeling innovation in this literature as well as a failure to keep abreast of important methodological developments emerging in other fields of the social sciences. In particular, there has been no recognition of major advances in discrete choice modeling over the last 15 years, which has increasingly relaxed behaviorally questionable assumptions associated with the independently and identically distributed errors (IID) condition and allowed for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. In contrast to standard logit, the mixed logit model fulfils this purpose and provides a superior framework for explanation and prediction. We explain the theoretical and econometric underpinnings of mixed logit and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in the context of a specific but topical area of accounting research: financial distress prediction. Comparisons of model\u2010fits and out\u2010of\u2010sample forecasts indicate that mixed logit outperforms standard logit by significant margins.

We analyze a sample of large publicly traded firms acquired in taxable cash\u2010for\u2010stock and tax\u2010free stock\u2010for\u2010stock acquisitions from 1975 to 2000. We model acquisition structure (i.e., taxable cash\u2010for\u2010stock acquisitions versus tax\u2010free stock\u2010for\u2010stock acquisitions) as a function of target shareholder capital gains taxes and other economic factors believed to influence acquisition structure. Consistent with expectations, we find a positive association between the capital gains tax rate for individual investors and the use of tax\u2010free stock\u2010for\u2010stock acquisitions. In addition, we find that the effect of the capital gains tax rate for individuals decreases with target institutional ownership (a proxy that represents the likelihood the price\u2010setting shareholder is not subject to the individual capital gains tax rate). We reconcile our analyses with previous studies and identify a plausible explanation for the lack of results in prior research. In supplemental analysis, we also report evidence that corporations \u201ctime\u201d the completion of taxable acquisitions around major tax rate changes to minimize shareholder capital gains taxes. In sum, results suggest that shareholder\u2010level taxes have a significant effect on the choice of taxable cash\u2010for\u2010stock versus tax\u2010free stock\u2010for\u2010stock acquisitions, and this effect varies with the tax status of target shareholders.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/4/859/2802/The-Effect-of-Shareholder-Level-Capital-Gains","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of capital gains taxes and their effect on corporate acquisition structures, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize and find that abnormally large option exercises predict stock return future performance. We then hypothesize that this predictive ability represents private information about disappointing earnings in the post\u2010exercise period. Consistent with this hypothesis we find that abnormally positive earnings performance in the pre\u2010exercise period turns to disappointing earnings performance in the post\u2010exercise period, and that this pattern comes as a surprise to even sophisticated market participants (financial analysts). We also hypothesize and find that the disappointing earnings in the post\u2010exercise period represent a reversal of inflated earnings in the pre\u2010exercise period. Collectively, these findings suggest that the private information used by top\u2010level executives to time abnormally large exercises follows from earnings management so as to increase the cash payout of exercises.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/4/889/2750/Private-Information-Earnings-Manipulations-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial manipulations and executive decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

However, few opportunities exist to investigate this issue empirically. We identify a setting that offers us such an opportunity: the electric utility industry as it transitions toward deregulation. We consider two types of voluntary disclosures: strategies to protect the firm's existing customer base and plans to exploit emerging opportunities under deregulation. We examine these particular disclosures since they are voluntary, relevant to all sample firms, and convey positive information about the firm's prospects in a deregulated environment. We consider three target audiences: industry regulators, capital market participants, and product market competitors. We find that our disclosure index is negatively associated with the magnitude of utilities' stranded costs in jurisdictions where the stranded cost recovery issue is unresolved, consistent with our predicted regulatory incentives. Further, our evidence indicates that capital market\u2010related incentives are positively associated with our disclosure index. Finally, we find that product market\u2010related incentives play a deterrent role in disclosure, but only after regulatory concerns have been resolved.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/4/921/2765/Voluntary-Disclosure-in-a-Multi-Audience-Setting","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['voluntary disclosure', 'incentives', 'audiences']","The article primarily focuses on voluntary disclosure decisions in a business context without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques of business practices.

While audit workpaper preparers typically know they will be reviewed, and know the form their review will take, prior research has focused on comparing the judgments of auditors who expect to be reviewed with auditors who expect to remain anonymous. This study examines the effects on preparers of using two different methods of review: face\u2010to\u2010face and electronic review. The study also compares both review groups to a no\u2010review control group. Consistent with the Heuristic\u2010Systematic Model, we find that the method of review affects preparer effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, preparers anticipating a face\u2010to\u2010face review are more concerned with audit effectiveness, produce higher quality judgments, are less efficient at their task, are less likely to be influenced by prior year workpapers, and feel more accountable than preparers in both the electronic review and no\u2010review conditions. Interestingly, electronic review preparers generally do not differ from the no\u2010review group. These results suggest that how a review will be conducted, and not merely the expectation that a review will occur, affects the decision\u2010maker's judgments and perceptions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/4/949/2777/Electronic-versus-Face-to-Face-Review-The-Effects","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['review', 'performance', 'accountability']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of audit review methods and their impact on performance, with minimal reference to social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We characterize the first four attributes as accounting\u2010based because they are typically measured using accounting information only. We characterize the last three attributes as market\u2010based because proxies for these constructs are typically based on relations between market data and accounting data. Based on theoretical models predicting a positive association between information quality and cost of equity, we test for and find that firms with the least favorable values of each attribute, considered individually, generally experience larger costs of equity than firms with the most favorable values. The largest cost of equity effects are observed for the accounting\u2010based attributes, in particular, accrual quality. These findings are robust to controls for innate determinants of the earnings attributes (firm size, cash flow and sales volatility, incidence of loss, operating cycle, intangibles use/intensity, and capital intensity), as well as to alternative proxies for the cost of equity capital.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/79/4/967/2787/Costs-of-Equity-and-Earnings-Attributes","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and finance, specifically the relationship between cost of equity and earnings attributes, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.
