Facades of Conformity, Values Incongruence, and the Moderating Impact of Leader Integrity","When employees feel that their values do not match those of the organization, they often respond by pretending to fit in. We examine how leader integrity influences the tendency to create facades of conformity, proposing that employees will actually fake more when leaders are principled. In a laboratory experiment (Study 1), undergraduate students whose values ostensibly differed from those of other discussion group members and the university administration created more facades when they perceived the discussion group leader as having high integrity. A two-wave survey of employed adults (Study 2) replicated the moderation effect and also revealed negative effects of facade creation on work engagement. In both studies, our results indicate that, ironically, when leader integrity is high, the tendency to create facades of conformity in response to low values congruence is magnified. Additionally, our findings reveal that positive attributes in leaders may not always result in positive responses from followers. The results from our study also show that facades of conformity may serve as a partial explanatory mechanism in the relationship between values congruence and employee engagement.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0404","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['values incongruence', 'leader integrity', 'facades of conformity']","The article discusses themes of values incongruence and leader integrity, which relate to ethical organizational practices and the impact of leadership on employee behavior.

By conducting a qualitative study of emergency-department physicians and their interactions with other hospital specialists, we show how specialists maintain professional values through two distinct processes of institutional work in which moral emotions\u2014that is, emotions linked to the interests of others\u2014play a key role. The first process is activated when a perceived episodic problem, which arises from value conflicts in interactions between different specialists, elicits transitory moral emotions that motivate institutional maintenance work through individual action. The second process is activated when a perceived systemic problem, which arises from conflict between professional values writ large and organizational practices, elicits moral emotions that are enduring and shared across specialists. These emotions mobilize collective action in institutional maintenance work that changes the organizational practice. By focusing on values as a source of conflict and a motive for professional action inside organizations, our model contributes a nuanced understanding to the everyday work of professionals and specialists and draws attention to emotion elicitors and emotional scope as affective mechanisms in processes of institutional work.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0870","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['values', 'moral emotions', 'institutional work', 'professional values']","The article discusses the maintenance of professional values and the role of moral emotions in institutional work, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations and the impact of values on organizational practices.

The present study draws on social identity theory to shift this debate from whether formalization reduces inequality to when, or under what conditions, less formalized pay systems may also serve to reduce inequality. Specifically, I consider both the gender of the decision maker and the job of the employee being evaluated. The goal of this study is to determine whether male and female managers differ in how they use the discretion afforded by less formalized pay systems, and to identify the implications for pay among employees at different levels of the organizational hierarchy. Among 857 employees in 120 retail branches of a financial services firm, I find evidence of less gender pay inequality in terms of less formalized components of pay for employees reporting to a female manager. However, this effect is only among employees in the lowest organizational ranks. These findings demonstrate that it is critical to take manager gender and the organizational position of the employees being evaluated into account when assessing the relationship between the formalization of pay and gender pay inequality.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.1060","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","7","['gender', 'inequality', 'discretion', 'manager', 'pay']","The article focuses on gender pay inequality and the role of manager gender in influencing pay systems, which aligns with themes of diversity and equity.

The current research addresses this important issue from an emotion-as-social-information perspective by exploring whether, why, and when leaders\u2019 affect influences employees\u2019 voice behavior. By collecting data of 640 daily interactions from both sides of 85 leader\u2013employee dyads using the experience sampling method through mobile surveys, we found that leaders\u2019 positive affect was positively related to employees\u2019 voice behavior. Furthermore, such a relationship could be accounted for through employees\u2019 psychological safety directly via the emotional contagion mechanism (through employees\u2019 own positive affect) but not directly via the signaling mechanism (through employees\u2019 assessment of leaders\u2019 positive affect); and the effects of both employees\u2019 own positive affect and their assessments of leaders\u2019 positive affect on psychological safety were stronger when the leader\u2013member exchange relationship was weak.

We investigate the speed of opportunity-evaluation decisions by focusing on firms\u2019 venture termination and venture advancement decisions. Experience, standard operating procedures, and confidence allow firms to make opportunity-evaluation decisions faster; we propose that a firm\u2019s attentional orientation, as reflected in its project portfolio, limits the number of domains in which these speed-enhancing mechanisms can be developed. Hence, firms\u2019 decision speed is likely to vary between different types of decisions. Using unique data on 3,269 mineral exploration ventures in the Australian mining industry, we find that firms with a higher degree of attention toward earlier-stage exploration activities are quicker to abandon potential opportunities in early development but slower to do so later, and that such firms are also slower to advance on potential opportunities at all stages compared to firms that focus their attention differently. Market dynamism moderates these relationships, but only with regard to initial evaluation decisions. Our study extends research on decision speed by showing that firms are not necessarily fast or slow regarding all the decisions they make, and by offering an opportunity-evaluation framework that recognizes that decision makers can\u2014in fact, often do\u2014pursue multiple potential opportunities simultaneously.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.1165","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making speed in the context of venture opportunities in the mining industry, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Recent work, however, has suggested that employees often engage in OCBs not because they want to but because they feel they have to, and it is not clear whether OCBs performed for external motives have the same positive effects on individuals and organizational functioning as do traditional OCBs. In this article, we draw from self-determination and moral licensing theories to suggest a potential negative consequence of OCB. Specifically, we argue that when employees feel compelled to engage in OCB by external forces, they will subsequently feel psychologically entitled for having gone above and beyond the call of duty. Furthermore, these feelings of entitlement can act as moral credentials that psychologically free employees to engage in both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Data from two multisource field studies and an online experiment provide support for these hypotheses. In addition, we demonstrate that OCB-generated feelings of entitlement transcend organizational boundaries and lead to deviance outside of the organization.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0234","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['citizenship behavior', 'deviance', 'moral licensing']","The article discusses organizational citizenship behaviors and their implications, touching on themes of entitlement and moral licensing, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or progressive themes.

Companies have primarily focused their employee training programs on two dimensions of display: intensity and authenticity. Yet there is limited research on when, how, and why these two dimensions affect customer reactions. Drawing on the emotions as social information (EASI) framework (Van Kleef, 2009), we develop a conceptual model in which display intensity and display authenticity differentially influence customer loyalty by changing customers\u2019 affective reactions and cognitive appraisals. Further, we propose that the relative impact of either dimension depends on customers\u2019 motivation to understand the environment deeply and accurately (i.e., their epistemic motivation). We tested our model in one field study and one laboratory study.

A three-waved time-lagged survey of teachers and a field study of technical workers provided convergent support for this model. In Study 1, using data from 327 teachers and their immediate supervisors, we found support for our hypotheses that perceived underemployment had an inverted U-shaped relationship with task crafting and that this relationship was moderated by organizational identification. When the teachers\u2019 organizational identification was high, they engaged in more task crafting for the organization at intermediate levels of perceived underemployment.

We theorize that as job searches progress across time or discrete events, temporal-based pressure increases via perceptions that situations are less changeable or more critical, propelling envious job seekers toward deviant rather than normative search behavior. We propose that market-based pressure, deriving from employment opportunity perceptions, further moderates these effects. In a first study of unemployed job seekers, after more search time passes, job search envy relates to deviant search behavior. Market pressure further qualifies this relationship, although contrary to our prediction, lower market pressure exacerbates rather than attenuates the relationship. Study 2, a two-year study of graduate students engaged in internship and full-time job searches, focuses on event-based temporal pressure and mostly replicates the Study 1 findings. It also indicates that under lower event and market pressures, job seekers expend more effort but do not commit resume fraud in response to job search envy.

While a growing body of work on evangelists has emphasized their individual characteristics, the role of emotions in driving their activities, as well as how they advocate for organizations, our study demonstrates how evangelism can be built through ritualized interactions with organizations. Specifically, we reveal how organizations develop rituals that translate emerging practices into inspiring emotional experiences for particular members of audiences. This suggests that rituals can be used not only to incite dedication within organizational boundaries, but to inspire members of external audiences to act as social conduits through which emerging practices spread.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0092","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['emotional experiences', 'advocate', 'rituals']","The article discusses how organizations create emotional connections and advocate for new practices, which touches on themes of social engagement and community involvement.

In this research, I explore one implication of this shift\u2014how employees respond to client conflicts. In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates, hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others\u2019 emotions, and that mediators\u2019 emotion work contributes to the success of collective sensemaking.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0101","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['collaborative relationships', 'empathy', 'conflict', 'emotion work']","The article discusses the importance of developing collaborative relationships and emphasizes empathy in conflict resolution, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social interaction and emotional intelligence in organizational contexts."],["2017","60","2","Shmuel EllisTel Aviv University; College of Management Academic StudiesSearch for more papers by this author, Barak S.

We show two mediation effects and one moderation effect, supporting our theoretical argument that the longevity of imprinting effects is due to heredity processes.

Coordinating requires that interdependent specialists achieve integrating conditions for coordination\u2014including understanding who is accountable for carrying out a given task, how a sequence of actions should proceed, and how one\u2019s work fits into the whole on an ongoing basis. Navigating the inevitable disconnect between formal logics of action and the specifics of the local context and situation at hand is a hallmark of effective coordinating. Nevertheless, as work systems designed to direct action with a heavy hand are increasingly implemented in organizations, the disconnect between formal delineations and situated practice is transformed with large negative consequences for organizations. Through 16 months of empirical research using ethnographic methods surrounding implementation of an electronic health records (EHR) system in a hospital obstetric unit, we find that the EHR rendered what was once a productive disconnect between formal logics and situated practice into an unproductive disconnect. Further, this shift engendered a new form of ongoing coordinating. What was once \u201cartful coordinating\u201d\u2014in which clinicians across occupations drew upon formal logics, local context, and situated contingencies as resources to action and, in so doing, created conditions of predictability and informal accountability\u2014became \u201ccontorted coordinating,\u201d characterized by working around formal logics of the EHR while struggling to meet the demands of local context and situated contingencies, thus undermining predictability.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0315","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['accountability', 'coordination', 'context']","The article discusses the importance of accountability and the challenges of coordinating tasks within specific contexts, which touches on ethical organizational practices.

An Investigation of Justice Variability and Stress","Research on organizational justice has predominantly focused on between-individual differences in average levels of fair treatment experienced by employees.

Drawing on uncertainty management theory, we merge these two streams of research and introduce the concept of \u201cjustice variability,\u201d which captures between-person differences in the stability of fairness over time. Contrary to the intuitive notion that more fairness is always better, our work shows that being treated consistently unfairly can be better for employees than being treated fairly sometimes and unfairly at other times. Specifically, in a lab study, variably fair treatment resulted in greater physiological stress than both consistently fair and consistently unfair treatment. In a multilevel, experience-sampling field study, we replicated the positive association between justice variability and stress, and we also showed that justice variability exacerbated the positive, daily relationship between general workplace uncertainty and stress. Moreover, daily stress mediated the effects of justice variability on daily job dissatisfaction and emotional exhaustion.

Two field studies (Studies 1 and 3) and two laboratory experiments (Studies 2 and 4) reveal a female premium that is unique to high-potential women (Studies 1 and 2), driven by perceptions that high-potential women have more diversity value than high-potential men (Studies 2 and 4), and larger in contexts where diversity goals are stronger (Studies 3 and 4).

While these events bear an intuitive connection to corporate reputation, several scholars have raised questions about the role of discrete exchanges in overall evaluations of firms. Additionally, scholars have neither systematically examined such effects nor elaborated a formal theory thereof. The present paper fills this gap by developing and testing a middle range theory of this important yet poorly understood relationship. This theory identifies the psychological mechanism (trait attribution) which underlies this relationship and explains how discrete, stakeholder-specific exchange failures can damage reputations of larger corporate entities. It also explains how social and historical information associated with failed exchanges can affect this process. We elaborate and test this theory through a study of the effects of quarterly earnings misses on firms\u2019 standing in the Fortune \u201cMost Admired Company\u201d survey. Consistent with our theory, earnings misses did damage firm standing. However, misses did not invariably produce reputational damage and, as predicted, their effects were contingent on associated social (e.g., peer firm reliability, institutional context) and historical (e.g., the firm\u2019s track record and statements) information.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0968","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['stakeholder', 'corporate reputation', 'social', 'historical']","The article discusses stakeholder exchanges and their impact on corporate reputation, touching on social and historical contexts.

We tested our model in two studies. In Study 1, multisource team data revealed that TMX enhanced member performance when teammates possessed attributes associated with high-quality resources (i.e., high cognitive ability) or when the leader did not.

Instead, change emerged in a practice that was not treated as a priority and that subsequently attracted interest from a very limited number of individuals. Our findings contribute to the resourcing literature by showing that the ability to use resources is shaped by how they are valued and distributed, and that strategic change initiatives can act as triggers for resource revaluations and redistributions. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategic change initiatives may contribute to the emergence of favorable conditions for change in practices that do not become associated with valued resources. This is because a lack of valued resources attracts limited interest from stakeholders, thereby allowing changes to emerge as powerful agents face minimal coordination costs and scrutiny when attempting to align arrangements with their own interests. Our study thereby shows how and why change initiatives can trigger divergent developments across multiple practices and lead to change emergence in unexpected places.

Organizations commonly set targets\u2014explicit and quantitative reference points\u2014for their operational units that reflect top management aspirations for these units. Targets are commonly the outcome of a subjective process where supervisors combine their explicit and tacit knowledge to set performance expectations for their units. Using a proprietary database from a large European travel company during a period of rapid expansion, we document the effect of organizational learning by studying how targets change as units mature. In particular, we examine managers\u2019 experiential learning from branches\u2019 past performance and their vicarious learning from branches in the same region in determining performance expectations over the life cycle of branches. Our results indicate that, in setting performance targets, managers increase the weight of a branch\u2019s past performance and decrease the weight of comparable branches\u2019 performance as the branch matures. Vicarious learning, where managers extrapolate the performance of comparable branches to a new branch, dominates in the early years. Over time, this type of learning is replaced by experiential learning as experience accumulates. We document how early on in the life of branches, these two types of learning interact; this interaction disappears as branches mature. Furthermore, we find that managers learn differently from successes and failures early in the lives of the new units, and this learning is affected by the magnitude of the successes and failures.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0897","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational learning and performance targets without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

We address some of these conflicting findings and aim to advance theory in two ways. First, we draw on transaction cost economics to explain why and how the effects of cultural distance on the proportion of expatriate parent-country nationals form a curvilinear relationship, instead of a linear one as commonly proposed. Second, we integrate the values-based cultural distance concept with the norms-based tightness\u2013looseness concept. This allows us to simultaneously account for cultural differences between countries and location-bound normative cultural effects within countries, which cannot be overcome solely through expatriate learning and adaptation. Using a large global dataset of Japanese MNEs, we find support for a convex relationship between cultural distance and the proportion of expatriate parent-country nationals. We also find a moderating (steepening) effect of tightness\u2013looseness on this relationship.

Specifically, we argue a successful lobbying strategy consists of both the breadth of government targeted and the political connectedness of the firm. Empirical results support our contentions that lobbying breadth and political connectedness affect the benefits firms receive from lobbying, which we operationalize both using government contracts and firm economic performance. Our analyses imply that more is not always better in the case of lobbying breadth, as the benefits accrued via dispersing lobbying across more governmental entities reaches a point of diminishing returns when lobbying breadth reaches high levels. Further, political connectedness has a moderating effect on the outcomes of lobbying breadth.

Our analysis focuses on 345 randomly sampled CEOs of private manufacturing companies in the Yangzi Delta region in China. The results confirm the importance of risk preferences in explaining strategic choices and performance effects: there is a negative association between risk aversion and reliance on guanxi activities, although company age and market orientation moderate the behavioral effect of risk preferences.

Drawing on conservation of resources theory and the ecological congruence model, we conduct a five-day diary study among customer service representatives (CSRs) to examine the extended depleting effect of surface acting and whether social interactions with coworkers (i.e., giving and receiving help) can mitigate the negative consequences of emotional labor. Momentary reports from 102 CSRs indicate that within-person daily surface acting positively predicted end-of-day emotional exhaustion, and the effect of emotional exhaustion spilled over to work engagement the following day. Analyzing the within-person moderating effects of giving and receiving help at work, we find that giving help buffered the depletion process while receiving help did not. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of considering the temporality of the resource-depleting effects of surface acting, the role of at-work help giving in buffering the negative effect of emotional labor that could affect the sense of self, and the importance of resource congruence in influencing the efficacy of buffering effects.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0611","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['help', 'emotional labor', 'social interactions', 'resource depletion']","The article discusses the importance of social interactions and help among coworkers, which aligns with themes of emotional well-being and support in the workplace.

Given the economic benefits of helping, it seems important that, during difficult economic periods, the amount of helping does not decline. Yet, in this research, we propose and show that it does. We argue that cues that signal the economy is performing poorly prompt a construal that the success of one person implies less success for others. This zero-sum construal of success in turn makes employees less inclined to help. Four studies found evidence consistent with our theory. Study 1 found that worse economic periods are associated with a more zero-sum construal of success, using data from 59,694 respondents surveyed across 51 countries and 17 years and objective indicators of their macroeconomic environments. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally induced the perception that the U.S. economy was performing poorly with a sample of U.S. employees and found that this perception led employees to have a more zero-sum construal of success and made them less inclined to help. Study 4 was an unobtrusive experiment carried out among freelance professionals from 47 countries, and it found that participants\u2019 perception that the economy in their country was in a downturn was associated with a more zero-sum construal of success and less helping behavior.

Researchers may not engage in interdisciplinarity because they would have to invest in new knowledge unrelated to their discipline or risk losing career-related rewards. Our field study of a university interdisciplinary research center shows that boundary spanning occurred as students interacted with scientific instruments in a symbiotic relationship through what we call symbiont practices: matching disciplinary language and methods with the experimental possibilities of instruments, developing cospecialization between students and instruments, and engaging disciplinary actors to design experiments using instruments. Instruments engendered incipient interdisciplinary possibilities, but they required the students\u2014engaging in symbiont practices\u2014to actualize that potential. Simultaneously, students required instruments in order to be classified, staffed on projects, and placed in jobs. These practices resolved both the cognitive and economic challenges of boundary spanning by mobilizing material resources that were costly (cognitively and politically) for actors on either side of the disciplinary divide to engage.

Although deference is a well-known consequence of relationships between partners of unequal status, little is known on whether deference in one domain can affect interactions between the same actors in other domains. This can happen within multiplex relationships, especially when they involve firms that have both business and personal interactions between their key decision makers. We combine insights from the literatures on status, multiplex relationships, and competitive positioning to examine how actors\u2019 behaviors in a business domain of a multiplex relationship are shaped by the deference norms in a personal domain of the same relationship. We argue that marriages between owner-families of Korean business groups cause deferential behaviors between these families as a function of gender-based status differences within kinship ties. We show empirically that the inter-personal deference resulting from marriage affects business group market entries or exits, and in turn the group\u2019s performance.

In contrast, we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively, but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait.

Evidence from Attorneys Before and After 9/11","This study places important boundary conditions on the generally accepted notion that CSR will reduce turnover. Our primary argument is that CSR will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work. We find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms. We find that firms with higher levels of CSR have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes, moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms. Strikingly, the retention benefits of CSR are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality-related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs (i.e., for New York City-born attorneys following the 9/11 terror attacks). To our surprise, we also find that firms with higher levels of CSR experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms. In addition to our arguments about the importance of meaningfulness, the study provides two important extensions to work examining CSR and turnover: (1) it may be useful to view the CSR-turnover relationship through a risk-management lens, and (2) investments in CSR may increase employee departures from organizations under certain conditions.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0032","additional articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['Corporate Social Responsibility', 'meaningfulness', 'employee turnover']","The article discusses Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and its impact on employee turnover, particularly in the context of meaningful work, which aligns with moderate woke themes of ethical organizational practices and employee well-being.

Using a two-wave survey design, Study 1 found a positive relationship between mating motivation and unethical negotiation behavior for male, but not female, employees.

As such, we predict that, while traditional aid providers remain important for disaster recovery, relief will arrive faster and nations will recover more fully when locally active firms account for a larger share of disaster aid.

To make progress, diverse communities often coalesce around an ambitious field goal. However, many field initiatives fall short of their initial objectives. When fields mobilize for a grand challenge, what inhibits them from realizing their intended ambitions? This is a critical question not only for grand challenges, but also for institutional theory, which tends to focus on field mobilization rather than on how goals are pursued over time. Field scholars often assume stable participants with goals that easily translate into actions, but fields are dynamic and unlikely to comply with these assumptions. With a longitudinal, multimethod study of the nanotechnology field, we examined how five communities mobilized and pursued the grand challenge of creating molecular manufacturing from 1986 to 2005. We identify a key duality of mobilization: the very strategies employed to successfully mobilize diverse participants to support the grand challenge actually helped displace it with less ambitious goals.

Building on recent theory and research that a leader\u2019s humility discourages subordinates from voluntarily departing by increasing their job satisfaction, we propose that faultlines in TMTs can exert cross-level effects attenuating how humble executives sustain MMs\u2019 job satisfaction, and how MMs\u2019 job dissatisfaction drives their voluntary turnover. We verify these effects with a multisource, multiphase dataset of 43 TMTs, 313 top executives, and 502 MMs. Our study thus bridges the macro and micro divide to offer a multilevel inquiry into contextual influences on voluntary turnover, identifies a boundary condition for leader humility effects, and clarifies how TMT faultlines represent a contextual constraint on how top executives induce MM subordinates to stay.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.1072","additional articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['humility', 'job satisfaction', 'voluntary turnover', 'middle managers', 'top management teams']","The article discusses the role of humility in leadership and its impact on job satisfaction and turnover among middle managers, indicating a moderate focus on ethical organizational practices and employee well-being.

Yet, how these antecedents translate into outcomes may depend on what employees speak up about and its implications for implementation. We engage in three studies to explore what individuals speak up about, why they speak up about those things, and the consequences of voicing such content. First, through a qualitative field study, we find evidence for three dimensions of voice content: the importance of initiating change, the required resources to enact the desired change, and the interdependencies involved in implementing the desired change. Further, specific targets of identification\u2014either one\u2019s local work unit or one\u2019s broader profession\u2014shape whether the issues individuals raise take into account barriers related to resources and interdependencies. Next, in a quantitative field study, we find that voicing on issues related to one\u2019s work unit or profession mediates the relationship between employee identification and managers\u2019 valuation of voice. Finally, in an experiment, we manipulate importance, resources, and interdependencies of implementation and find these dimensions of voice content influence managerial value of voice.

These design performances influence routine dynamics by both eliciting mechanisms of abstracting grammars of action, exposing assumptions, distributing agency, and appraising outcomes, and by creating new assemblages that can be deployed in future routine performances.

In Study 1, a longitudinal field study of customer service representatives (n = 763) who simultaneously identify with multiple brands they represent to customers, we examine the relationships between identity conflict and enhancement, on the one hand, and objective sales performance, on the other. We find independent effects for identity conflict and enhancement on intrinsic motivation, perspective-taking and performance, such that identity conflict negatively and enhancement positively affects all three variables above and beyond average identification. Intrinsic motivation further mediates the relationships between identity conflict and enhancement on sales in a direction consistent with our theorizing. However, while significant, perspective-taking does not mediate these relationships in the expected direction, because it has a negative effect on sales. In Studies 2a and 2b, we strengthen causal inference using an experimental moderation-of-process approach to constructively replicate and extend our findings.

We advance pliable guidance as a theoretical umbrella to describe how feedback seekers and providers in creative work find a balance between the direction that makes feedback informative and the freedom to explore that infuses new ideas in their work. Our findings show that more curious individuals seek feedback by asking more open questions, which allows them to obtain more feedback. We also find that ambivalent feedback is more likely to lead to feedback acceptance and design revision.

We find that audiences stigmatize an organization because they fear that it threatens a particular moral order, which leads them to mount sustained attacks designed to weaken or eradicate the organization. Our model suggests that an organization that experiences this form of profound disapproval can nonetheless purge its stigma and become legitimate through a two-step process: first the organization engages in stigma reduction work designed to minimize overt hostility among audiences by showing that it does not pose a risk to them. Second it engages in stigma elimination work designed to gain support from stigmatizers by showing that it plays a positive role in society. Our study therefore reorients organizational stigma research from a focus on how organizations can cope with the effects of stigma, and considers instead how they can eradicate the stigma altogether.

Our findings suggest a recursive model of new logic construction in which council members mobilize three emotional facilitators (social emotions, moral emotions, and emotional energy) to affect three logic-construction cycles (agreeing on values, shared learning, and enacting shared values). Emotional facilitators work through three agentic mechanisms: enabling actors to become open and reflexive about their home logics and simultaneously increase their commitment to and engagement in constructing a shared governance logic. Ongoing interactions involving emotional facilitators, agentic mechanisms, and logic-construction cycles are essential in sustaining the new logic. The process model foregrounds the role of emotions in enabling dually embedded agency, thereby extending extant theory that has tended to focus narrowly on cognitive dynamics. We discuss implications for our understanding of institutional agency, the role of emotions in new logic construction, and the role of microlevel interactions in the formation of macrolevel structures.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0402","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['governance', 'emotions', 'agency', 'shared values', 'institutional']","The article discusses the construction of a shared governance logic, emphasizing the role of emotions and values in facilitating agency among diverse actors.

Classical organization theory prescribes unity of command, achieved by combining the chief executive officer (CEO) and board chair positions; in contrast, agency theory prescribes independent monitoring, achieved by separating the CEO and board chair positions. Extant theory does not acknowledge the possibility that a compromise might exist between these competing theoretical prescriptions, one which might reduce their mutual exclusivity. Such a compromise has emerged in practice, however: the lead independent director. In the present research, we initiate theoretical exploration of this compromise between the prescriptions of agency theory and classical organization theory, addressing the questions of when a board will choose to appoint a lead independent director, who among the independent directors will serve in the position, how lead independent director appointment will impact firm performance, and whether this compromise is a permanent solution or a stepping stone to a more extreme outcome. Analysis of S&P 1500 firms from 2002 to 2012 reveals that lead independent director appointment reflects balanced power on the board, impacts firm performance positively under the right conditions, and generally becomes institutionalized as a permanent governance structure.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0852","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['independent director', 'board leadership', 'agency theory']","The article discusses governance structures and board leadership but does not explicitly address themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

In parallel, we analyze qualitative data obtained through interviews conducted during early months of the team-based empowerment initiative to identify common themes for why and how leaders facilitated or obstructed implementation. Leader identity work and leader delegation were identified as themes explaining (1) why higher-status leaders struggled with the new empowering role and (2) how specific leader actions either facilitated or inhibited sharing of tasks and leadership. Results suggest that team-based empowerment creates a status threat for high-status leaders who then struggle to protect their old identity as someone with distinct professional capabilities, which in turn leads to improper delegation behavior.

From both the theoretical and empirical points of view, this increased attention has generated many inconsistencies. In this article we propose that a conceptualization of the idea journey encompassing phases that the literature has so far overlooked can help solve existing tensions. We conceptualize four phases of the journey of an idea, from conception to completion: idea generation, idea elaboration, idea championing, and idea implementation. We propose that a creator has distinct primary needs in each phase: cognitive flexibility, support, influence, and shared vision, respectively. Individual creators successfully move through a phase when the relational and structural elements of their networks match the distinct needs of the phase. The relational and structural elements that are beneficial for one phase, however, are detrimental for another. We propose that in order to solve this seeming contradiction and the associated paradoxes, individual creators have to change interpretations and frames throughout the different phases. This, in turn, allows them to activate different network characteristics at the appropriate moment and successfully complete the idea journey from novel concept to a tangible outcome that changes the field.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2014.0462","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","3","['creativity', 'innovation', 'social networks']","The article discusses creativity and innovation in the context of social networks, which suggests an awareness of relational dynamics.

Affective events theory indicates that emotions are relevant at each of these three stages, although their influence is manifested in different ways and at different levels of analysis. During the initial role-taking stage, leaders\u2019 affective expressions serve as affective events influencing member emotions through the processes of emotional contagion and affective empathy, which determine the progress of further relationship development. Next, during the role-making stage, leaders and members are both sources of affective events, and they may gradually become affectively entrained such that their affective states tend to fluctuate in a common rhythm. This pattern of dyadic-level affect helps to build high-quality LMX relationships over time. Finally, during the role routinization stage, an LMX relationship has been formed but, we argue, could subsequently change based on member emotional responses to the distribution of LMX relationships within a workgroup (LMX differentiation).","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2014.0384","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","3","['emotions', 'leader-member exchange', 'affective events']","The article discusses the emotional dynamics within leader-member exchanges, which touches on aspects of interpersonal relationships in organizations.

We suggest that these three interrelated processes work together to form one of six unique organizational affect climate types. Further, we develop theory to explain how each affect climate type differentially impacts four strategic outcomes of organizational units: relationship, productivity, creativity, and reliability performance.

These assumptions are problematic when studying the institutionalization process, where doing, saying, and meaning move from the micro level to the macro level. I argue that the three are distinct correlates of social reality corresponding to the semiotic triangle composed of referent, signifier, and signified, which is key to understanding institutionalization. I combine the semiotic triangle and the chain of signification to conceptualize the process of institutionalization as the coevolution of the three correlates of the sign. Specifically, I identify two kinds of institutionalization: denotational and connotational. Whereas denotational institutionalization entails the coupling of the referent, signifier, and signified, connotational institutionalization involves decoupling among the three. Furthermore, decoupling occurs not only between doing and saying, as shown in existing management studies, but also between doing and meaning, as well as between meaning and saying. Based on this conceptualization, both kinds of institutionalization processes increase the taken-for-grantedness of the sign, but what is taken for granted differs drastically, which explains the heterogeneity in the institutionalization process.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2014.0274","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","2","['institutionalization', 'social reality', 'semiotic']","The article primarily focuses on theoretical aspects of institutionalization without a clear emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Uncertainty is even greater when the country\u2019s political institutions remain authoritarian because the rule of law is weak and state bureaucrats retain power over the economy. This study of listed firms in China, which has recently seen economic transition but persistent authoritarianism, shows that in such contexts, firms can reduce uncertainty by developing relationships with state bureaucrats, which help firms learn how state bureaucracies operate and engender trust between firms and bureaucrats. Together, knowledge and trust stabilize operations and help persuade bureaucrats to lighten regulatory burdens, grant firms access to state-controlled resources, and improve government oversight. Our results show that as economic transitions proceed and uncertainty increases, business\u2013state ties increasingly improve firm performance.

Using data on software start-ups from 1990 to 2002, we show that collective sense-making in the wake of such vital events can result in consensus behavior among entrepreneurs. Market search is a critical part of the entrepreneurial process, as entrepreneurs frequently enter new markets to find high-growth areas. When spectacular financings result in a collective overstatement of the attractiveness of a market, a consensus emerges that the market is resource-rich, and the path is cleared for many entries, including those that do not have a clear fit. When notorious failures render a market unpopular, only the most viable entrants will overcome exaggerated skepticism and enter, taking the non-consensus route. Venture capitalists likewise exhibit herding behavior, following other VCs into hot markets. We theorize that vital events effectively change the selection threshold for market entries, which changes the average viability of new entrants. We find that consensus entrants are less viable, while non-consensus entrants are more likely to prosper. Non-consensus entrepreneurs who buck the trends are most likely to stay in the market, receive funding, and ultimately go public.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839216661150","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['entrepreneurs', 'market', 'collective beliefs']","The article discusses market behavior and entrepreneurial responses but lacks a clear focus on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

To investigate this, we empirically distinguish production and reception effects and highlight a new production penalty: lower productivity, which may be attributable to cognitive and collaborative challenges associated with interdisciplinary research and/or hurdles in the review process. Using an innovative measure of interdisciplinary research that considers the similarity of the disciplines spanned, we document both penalties (fewer papers published) and benefits (increased citations) associated with it and show that it is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, one that partly depends on field-level interdisciplinarity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839216665364","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['interdisciplinary', 'innovation', 'benefits', 'penalties']","The article discusses the benefits and penalties of interdisciplinary research, which touches on themes of innovation and collaboration but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

Drawing on research on social comparisons and firm boundaries, we argue that large firms are susceptible to their employees making social comparisons about wages and that firms undertake strategies, such as wage compression, to help ameliorate their damaging effects. We argue that wage compression affects the distribution of wages throughout the broader labor market and that, consequently, state levels of income inequality will increase as fewer individuals in a state are employed by large firms. We hypothesize that the negative relationship between large-firm employment and income inequality will weaken when large employers are more racially diverse and their workers are dispersed across a greater number of establishments. Our results show that as the number of workers in a state employed by large firms declines, income inequality in that state increases. When these firms are more racially diverse, however, the negative relationship between large-firm employment and income inequality weakens.

Our data indicate that inmates experienced respect in two distinct ways, generalized and particularized, which initiated an identity decoupling process that allowed them to distinguish between their inmate identity and their desired future selves and to construct transitional identities that facilitated positive change. The social context of the organization provided opportunities for personal and social identities to be claimed, respected, and granted, producing social validation and enabling individuals to feel secure in their transitional identities. We find that security in personal identities produces primarily performance-related outcomes, whereas security in the company identity produces primarily well-being-related outcomes.

Such diversity is even more critical when the type of natural disaster is more unexpected or complex (e.g., both a wildfire and an earthquake) in an area, and the organizational challenges posed are thus more novel for the community. Associational diversity has positive effects on both the numbers and aggregate size of foundings of local (non-branch, secular) human services organizations, and the effects are generalizable to other endogenous demand conditions such as poverty. Results also show how different kinds of variety can have opposing effects on organizing capacity after a disaster, with associational diversity having a positive effect, political diversity having a negative effect, and racial diversity having no significant effect, net of other factors.

We theorize and show that women are less likely than men to consider another job with a prospective employer that has rejected them in the past. Because of women\u2019s status as a negatively stereotyped minority in senior roles, recruitment rejection triggers uncertainty about their general belonging in the executive domain, which in turn leads women to place greater weight than men on fair treatment and negatively affects their perceptions of the fairness of the treatment they receive. This dual process makes women less inclined than men to apply again to a firm that has rejected them. We test our theory with three studies: a field study using longitudinal archival data from an executive search firm, a survey of executives, and an experiment using executive respondents testing the effects of rejection on willingness to apply to a firm for another position. The results have implications for theory and practice regarding gender inequality at the labor market\u2019s upper echelons, highlighting that women\u2019s supply-side decisions to \u201clean out\u201d of competition for senior roles must be understood in light of their previous experiences with employers\u2019 demand-side practices.

Although ingratiation, such as flattery or opinion conformity, may elicit positive affect from its target, we suggest it can also elicit a specific form of negative affect toward the target, which in turn can trigger interpersonal harm-doing. Focusing on ingratiation by top managers toward the CEO, we find that ingratiating managers are likely to develop feelings of resentment toward the CEO and that ingratiation may be especially likely to elicit resentment among top managers when the CEO is a racial minority or a woman.

Stakeholders with positive beliefs about the firm before the critical event mobilize to defend it, and those with negative prior beliefs reinforce their opposition. Shareholders also take note of the other stakeholders\u2019 prior beliefs and react negatively to critical events if the firm has a history of conflict with its stakeholders.

Used first as the inspiration for naming a new line of handcrafted beers, ten years later it became the motto featured in the company\u2019s identity statement. Findings describe a temporal pattern of micro-level activities that accounts for how actors used this historical material and, in doing so, lent the authenticity of history to their actions, a phenomenon we term organizational historicizing. Analysis of historicizing activities revealed five micro-processes: rediscovering, recontextualizing, reclaiming, renewing, and re-embedding of an artifact in organizational history.

We find that double standards disadvantaging women are most likely when evaluators face heightened search costs related to the number of candidates being compared or higher levels of uncertainty stemming from variation in the amount of pertinent information available. We rule out that systematic gender differences in the actions or characteristics of the investment professionals being evaluated are driving these results.

To resolve this paradox, we theorize that the potential legitimacy discount of categorical membership can be avoided when individuals are classified according to multiple categories simultaneously. We find that the transition to entrepreneurship is most likely to occur when an artist\u2019s functional experience is broad but market experience is narrow: he or she has mastered a variety of skills but solicited few audiences. We also find that the paradox of breadth is attenuated\u2014the potential penalty of functional breadth and the corresponding need to develop narrow market experience are reduced\u2014when the entrepreneur has alternate methods of signaling legitimacy, including high status and more-typical prior work experience. Moreover, some audiences are more disposed than others to allow an entrepreneur to pursue greater novelty.

Using data from 2,360 National Basketball Association (NBA) players and 163 coaches from 1955 to 2000, I find that players receive more playing time under coaches of the same race, even though there is no difference in their performance. This racial bias is greatly reduced, however, as the player and the coach spend more time on the same team, suggesting that repeated interaction minimizes coaches\u2019 biases toward their players. But it does not reduce coaches\u2019 racial biases in general.

We study the effect of two distinct forms of electronic commerce on market efficiency, which we measure via the existence and exploitation of spatial arbitrage opportunities. Spatial arbitrage represents a more precise measure of market efficiency than does price dispersion, which is typically used, because it accounts for the transaction costs of trading across distance and for unobserved product heterogeneity. One of the forms of electronic commerce that we study is a webcast channel that allows electronic access to the traditional physical market, while the other is a standalone electronic market. Both forms provide traders with expanded reach to find and transact with each other across geographic distance, but only one allows traders to conduct transactions immediately, at any time. This variance helps us isolate the effect of these mechanisms (reach and transaction immediacy) on efficiency. We find that electronic commerce reduces the number of arbitrage opportunities (likely by expanding traders\u2019 geographic reach) but improves arbitrageurs\u2019 ability to identify and exploit those that remain (likely by expanding arbitrageurs\u2019 reach and providing them with the immediacy to exploit opportunities quickly). Overall, our results suggest that electronic commerce improves market efficiency not only by helping buyers and sellers transact across distance (thereby balancing supply and demand across geographic locations) but also by helping arbitrageurs quickly exploit any remaining arbitrage opportunities (thereby rebalancing supply and demand across geographic locations).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0653","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of electronic commerce and market efficiency without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The durations of these visits vary not only across consumers but also for a given consumer across multiple visits. We argue that the amount of time that a consumer spends on the first visit to a website depends on how she is drawn to the website. We find that the duration of the first visit is influenced by the advertising tool\u2014banner ad or search engine\u2014used to attract consumers to the website. The durations of subsequent visits are influenced by the durations of earlier visits. The search durations are also influenced by the visit day of the week and time of day. In this paper, we develop a multiple-spell competing risk model to capture the underlying stochastic process, chief elements of which are two interrelated processes: a duration process and a transition process. The multistate, multiple-spell model allows us to identify a window of opportunity, within which the purchase probability is higher than the exit probability. Online salespersons should target site visitors during this window of opportunity. The model, which is calibrated on clickstream data obtained from a major online vendor, can also be used to determine the bid price strategy for search engine ads.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0655","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and advertising strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In such settings, online workers come and complete small tasks posted by employers, working for as long or as little as they wish, a process that eliminates the overhead of hiring (and dismissal). This flexibility introduces a different set of inefficiencies: verifying the quality of every submitted piece of work is an expensive operation that often requires the same level of effort as performing the task itself. A number of research challenges arise in such settings. How can we ensure that the submitted work is accurate? What allocation strategies can be employed to make the best use of the available labor force? How can we appropriately assess the performance of individual workers? In this paper, we consider labeling tasks and develop a comprehensive scheme for managing the quality of crowd labeling: First, we present several algorithms for inferring the true classes of objects and the quality of participating workers, assuming the labels are collected all at once before the inference. Next, we allow employers to adaptively decide which object to assign to the next arriving worker and propose several heuristic-based dynamic label allocation strategies to achieve the desired data quality with significantly fewer labels. Experimental results on both simulated and real data confirm the superior performance of the proposed allocation strategies over other existing policies. Finally, we introduce two novel metrics that can be used to objectively rank the performance of crowdsourced workers after fixing correctable worker errors and taking into account the costs of different classification errors. In particular, the worker value metric directly measures the monetary value contributed by each label of a worker toward meeting the quality requirements and provides a basis for the design of fair and efficient compensation schemes.

Empirically, we document how corporate participants in these contexts respond to market decisions, interdependent ideologies, and distributed relationships by continuously establishing and maintaining connections with community members; connections that stem from the social and material rules inherent in the open source community. Based on these observations, we create the theory of responsive design as a particular form of corporate software design which, beyond the inclusion of external participants, distinguishes itself from traditional monocentric design in which one corporation controls a dedicated team of software designers focused on solving an isolated and singular organizational problem. Guided by the principles of interconnection, opportunism, and domestication, we define responsive design as the kind of design approach that enables corporate participants to create and maintain productive design practices in response to the complex and dynamic landscapes of activities that are the foundation of corporate-communal engagements.

Against this backdrop, we examined the direct effects of CBs about advice from co-workers on system use as well as its ability to moderate the effects of other types of CBs on system use.

The coordination problem manifests itself by the fact that losing bidders need to submit nonoverlapping package bids that are high enough to outbid the standing winners. We propose an auction format, which leverages the information that the auctioneer collects throughout the auction about the preferences of individual bidders and suggests prices for the members of losing bidder coalitions, which in total would make a given coalition winning. We model the bidder\u2019s bundle selection problem as a coordination game, which provides a theoretical rationale for bidders to agree to these prices, and highlights the role of the auctioneer in providing relevant information feedback.

This study investigates a novel application of correlated online searches in predicting stock performance across supply chain partners. If two firms are economically dependent through a supply chain relationship and if information related to both firms diffuses in the market slowly or rapidly, then our ability to predict stock returns increases or decreases, respectively. We use online cosearches of stock as a proxy for the extent of information diffusion across supply chain-related firms. We identify publicly traded supply chain partners using Bloomberg data and construct cosearch networks of supply chain partners based on the weekly coviewing pattern of these firms on Yahoo! Finance. Our analyses show that the cosearch intensity across supply chain partners helps determine cross-return predictability. When investors of a focal stock pay less attention to its supply chain partners, we can use lagged partner returns to predict the future return of the focal stock. When investors\u2019 coattention to focal and partner stocks is high, the predictability is low. Our simulated trading strategy using returns of supply chain partners with low coattention generates a significant and positive return above the market returns and performs better than the previously established trading strategy using returns of all supply chain partners.

Traditionally, information systems development methodologies have been used to reconcile the competing demands from these two logics. In this paper, we study how these two logics manifest in a platform-based software ecosystem where significant entrepreneurial opportunities are created for independent third-party app developers (indies). Specifically, we study how indie developers manage the two logics on the iOS platform ecosystem under the influence of the platform owner Apple. We first identify practices of indie developers consistent with the two field logics across three entrepreneurial domains, i.e., app ideation, execution, and marketing. Second, we identify areas where the two field logics may be in conflict as well as in coexistence. We show that indie developers enact logic conflict through disagreement and denunciation of the opposing logic. When logics that are inherently opposed appear to coexist, we investigate how app developers manage these opposing demands through a process we call logic synthesis. Using a grounded theory approach, we propose a model of field-level market and professional logics operating in the mobile app platform ecosystem and the practices reflecting such logics in the indie developer community. Our work contributes to the growing literature on platform ecosystems and the processes adopted by third-party app developers in such ecosystems, in addition to furthering the study of institutional logics in technology contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0664","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['entrepreneurial opportunities', 'indie developers', 'logic conflict']","The article discusses the practices of indie developers and their management of conflicting logics, which hints at themes of entrepreneurship and community dynamics.

Contemporary firms are using IOSs to collaborate widely across the value chain and in an ever-expanding geographic landscape. Thus, institutional distance, which is the difference between the firms\u2019 respective institutional fields, has become a prominent challenge. In this study, we investigate the extent to which institutional distance affects IOS-enabled knowledge sharing and its impact on the joint performance of collaborating firms. We also explore the extent to which IOS adaptability could be a design solution for improving IOS-enabled knowledge sharing, given the challenge of institutional distance. Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that institutional distance, differentially influential via its normative, cognitive, and regulative aspects, not only reduces IOS-enabled knowledge sharing but also weakens the positive impact of such sharing on joint firm performance. Next, extending boundary object theory to the institutional context, we propose that IOS adaptability could be a solution to the challenge of institutional distance because it can directly strengthen IOS-enabled knowledge sharing as well as mitigate the negative effect of institutional distance on such sharing. Our hypotheses were tested through a field study that collected dyadic data from 141 distinct buyer/supplier channel relationships in 4 industries. The results from partial least squares modeling fully support our hypotheses with regard to cognitive distance, partially support those related to normative distance, but do not support those related to regulative distance.

Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identifiers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics fields. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a value-enumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data.

Determining Reservation Values to Negotiate Successfully for Composite Software Services","In the paradigm of service-centric computing, new value-added applications can be developed dynamically and flexibly by combining and integrating existing services. While software applications are traditionally specified and implemented as a set of functions uniform to all users, this new paradigm allows the same software service to be delivered with a different price, response time, availability, and other nonfunctional attributes to accommodate different modes of use. These nonfunctional attributes together are referred to as Quality of Service (QoS). When creating a new composite service, negotiation makes it possible for a service provider to offer the service with the QoS properties customized to the needs of a user. Automated negotiation tactics require the specification of reservation values for the QoS attributes. We present a methodology that determines the reservation values a user (or broker) should use for each component service based on the user\u2019s minimum requirements for the composite service. Our methodology maximizes the chance of reaching a successful negotiation outcome while staying within the user\u2019s reservation values for the composite service. We show that the problem of determining the user\u2019s reservation values for component services can be modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem and then transformed to a single-objective optimization problem using a max-min approach. The formulation can incorporate providers' different QoS preferences to increase the chance of negotiation success. We identify problem instances for which closed-form solutions can be found for the reservation values. We show how the method of setting reservation values can be incorporated into a negotiation process that uses extant concession and trade-off tactics. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. If some providers accept offers before the negotiation process deadline, we show that dynamically changing the reservation values for the remaining providers makes the overall negotiation process more likely to succeed.

Three common responses are identified based on the coping literature: task-focused coping, emotion-focused coping (i.e., worry and self-criticism), and avoidance coping. The three responses are used to conceptualize a higher-order construct, coping adaptiveness, that resides on a continuum between maladaptive coping and adaptive coping (manifested as increased task-focused coping and decreased emotion-focused coping and avoidance coping). Drawing on the extended parallel process model and behavioral decision-making literature, this paper examines the antecedents (i.e., perceived phishing threat, perceived detection efficacy, and phishing anxiety) and behavioral consequences (i.e., detection effort and detection accuracy) of coping adaptiveness. A survey experiment with 547 U.S. consumers was conducted. The results show that perceived detection efficacy increases coping adaptiveness. Partially mediated by phishing anxiety, perceived phishing threat decreases coping adaptiveness. Coping adaptiveness positively impacts the two objective measures in the study, detection effort and detection accuracy. The results also suggest that coping adaptiveness and detection effort have different effects on false positives compared to false negatives: detection effort fully mediates the effect of coping adaptiveness on false positive rate (or detection accuracy related to legitimate emails), but has no impact on false negatives (or detection accuracy related to phishing emails), unlike coping adaptiveness.

We use archival data for multinational firms publicly traded in the United States for the years 1999\u20132006, and find indirect evidence for the role of IT to help firms achieve higher foreign profits through revenue growth rather than cost reduction. Our findings suggest that foreign responsiveness plays a more important role in generating foreign profits than does value chain structure. Our exploratory analyses for the effect of IT on domestic revenues and profits suggest some evidence for equalization of returns across foreign and domestic operations. Among additional results, we find that research and development is positively associated with foreign revenues and foreign profits with an effect greater than that of IT, and advertising is positively associated with foreign revenues with an effect greater than that of IT. By documenting how IT creates value for firms through globalization, we extend the business value of IT and international business literatures that have so far touched on firm-level globalization benefits from IT only in passing.

It is generally believed that the existence of such unauthorized sales will cannibalize the profits of brand owners. In this paper, we develop a pricing model for a firm that sells an identical product in two distinct markets but faces the threat of potential gray market sales. The firm chooses prices in each market. A consumer chooses whether to buy the product from one of the markets including a gray market. We derive the optimal prices in the two markets and examine their effects on consumer demand and the total profit. We show that the higher price in one market transfers part of its demand into the gray market, thus influencing the consumer demand in the low-priced market as well. Additionally, the price gap between the two separate markets positively influences gray market sales and, under certain conditions, can lead to an increase in firm profit.

To better understand such a novel pricing mechanism, we develop a game theoretical model and start our analyses with a market consisting of one merchant, one affiliate site, and consumers heterogeneous in their product valuation. From a price point of view, cash-back shopping appears to provide site users with a saving opportunity since the effective post-cash-back price they pay is perceived to be lower than the regular price targeted at nonusers. However, we find that under some conditions, this seemingly lower price could be actually higher, compared with the optimal uniform price when the merchant does not price discriminate. An important implication is that all consumers may end up suffering from higher prices in the presence of the cash-back mechanism. This surprising result, referred to as the cash-back paradox, defies a common intuition that a price-discriminating firm must raise the price for one segment of consumers but decrease it for the other. We also develop two extensions to seek explanations behind various industry practices. We find that it is in a merchant\u2019s best interest to affiliate with multiple sites, and the resulting competition improves overall market efficiency. Moreover, merchants who are disadvantageous in brand valuation should target price-sensitive consumers by strategically offering cash-back deals.

OSS project leaders implement quality controls to improve the quality of developed products.

We focus on two quality controls\u2014accreditation and code acceptance, which, respectively, map to the input and output quality of an OSS project\u2014and compare their respective effects on VCPI in community-founded and spinout projects. We propose that accreditation and code acceptance influence VCPI by signaling unobservable input and output quality to volunteers. As we focus on continued participation, we theorize as to how volunteers\u2019 tenure in OSS projects moderates the relationships between the signaling effects of input and output quality controls and VCPI. Furthermore, we theorize as to how the OSS project type moderates the effects of quality controls on VCPI. We surveyed 304 volunteers from 40 OSS projects and constructed a two-level model of project and developer factors to explain VCPI. Our findings indicate that both accreditation and code acceptance enhance VCPI. The signaling effects on VCPI associated with accreditation decline with volunteer tenure, but those associated with code acceptance do not. Accreditation and code acceptance influence VCPI, with community-founded projects exhibiting weaker direct positive effects and spinout projects exhibiting stronger direct positive effects. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0687","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['volunteers', 'quality controls', 'participation']","The article discusses volunteer participation in open source software projects, which hints at collaborative and community-driven aspects.

We find that targeting a coupon to the low-valuation bidder can be optimal for the firm even if it leads to a reduction in the joint entry probability of the two bidders because of the benefit from value extraction. A novel result is that in the context of auctions it can be optimal for the seller to issue targeted coupons to the high-valuation bidder. We also find that an increase in the bidders\u2019 valuation or reduction in the participation cost can lead to lower profit for the seller.

We propose a modeling framework in which an individual\u2019s prepurchase expectation is shaped by (1) the product ratings she observes and (2) the perception of the review system she has at the time of the purchase. Upon product consumption, the individual obtains the postpurchase evaluation and encounters a certain level of disconfirmation. Drawing on the Bayesian learning framework, we model individual perception of the review system as a subjective attitude underlying how well the aggregate ratings match one\u2019s own usage experience. A hierarchical Bayesian model is developed and estimated using a rich data set comprising complete purchasing and rating activities on an e-commerce website. Our results suggest that an individual\u2019s decisions of whether to post a rating and what rating to post are affected by disconfirmation in two distinct manners. Specifically, an individual is more likely to leave a review when the magnitude of disconfirmation she encounters is larger. In addition, when the individual decides to review a product, the rating she chooses may not neutrally reflect her postpurchase evaluation; the direction of such a bias is in accordance with the sign of disconfirmation. We also observe several moderating effects: the disconfirmation effect on posting is attenuated by the time gap between purchase and receipt of the same product but accentuated by the dissension in product evaluations among peer consumers. A more granular examination reveals that infrequent raters are systematically more susceptible to disconfirmation than frequent posters. The insights from this research lead to actionable strategies for marketers and designers of recommender systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0694","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['disconfirmation', 'consumer behavior', 'ratings']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and rating systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

A fad is an ad that disappears if the user does not interact with it for some length of time. The withdrawn ad could be replaced by another ad. The goal of the ad network is to determine the sequence of fads shown to the user in an ad space to maximize the expected revenue generated over the user\u2019s app session. Mobile in-app advertising is uniquely suited for the sequencing of fads because user sessions are typically longer (than web sessions), and a single ad is displayed at any given point in time. We consider two factors that affect the probability of a click on an ad during a session: (i) the sojourn effect, the influence of the passage of time, and (ii) the exposure effect, the influence of the number of prior exposures of the ad to the user during that session. We provide simple and optimal policies for the ad-sequencing problem when either of these two effects dominates. For the general case in which both effects are significant, we offer a provably near-optimal heuristic policy. The following two enhancements to the basic sequencing problem are also analyzed: (a) consideration of both click ads (which generate revenue for the ad network only through clicks) and display ads (which generate revenue only through exposures) and (b) the presence of a constraint imposed by the publisher (i.e., the owner of the app) that the expected revenue in each time slot exceeds a certain threshold.

Pricing Information Goods with Depreciation of Consumer Valuation","Should a monopolistic vendor adopt the selling model or the leasing model for information goods or services? We study this question in the context of consumer valuation depreciation. Using a two-period game-theoretic model, we consider two types of consumer valuation depreciation for information goods or services: vintage depreciation and individual depreciation. Vintage depreciation assumes that a good or service loses some of its appeal to consumers as it becomes dated, and this effect persists independent of usage. Individual depreciation instead assumes that valuation depreciation happens only for consumers who have consumed or experienced the good or service. We identify conditions under which each pricing model is preferred. For vintage depreciation information goods, the leasing model dominates the selling model in vendor profit. For individual depreciation information goods, the selling model dominates the leasing model as long as the magnitude of individual depreciation exceeds a certain threshold; otherwise, leasing dominates selling. We consider several model extensions such as when network effects are present. Furthermore, we show a negative interaction effect between vintage depreciation and network effects in vendor profit. By contrast, the interaction effect between individual depreciation and network effects can be either negative or positive, depending on the magnitude of individual depreciation. Managerial implications are also discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0698","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing models for information goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Demonstration in the Context of Community-Care Electronic Health Records","We contribute to the shifting discourse in the literature on information system use, towards context-specific (rather than general) theories and effective use (rather than just use). Organizations are under great pressure to use information systems effectively but they have few theories to turn to for insights. Motivated by this need, we propose an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use. The approach suggests that effective use can be theorized by: (1) understanding how a network of affordances supports the achievement of organizational goals, (2) understanding how the affordances are actualized, and (3) using inductive theorizing to elaborate these principles in a given context. We demonstrate the approach in the context of a Canadian health authority\u2019s use of a community-care electronic healthcare record (EHR). We discovered that effective use in this context can be viewed at a high level as the accuracy and consistency with which users work with the EHR, and how they engage in reflection-in-action across a network of nine affordances. The key, however, is understanding how those elements interact with the multiple levels of data needed to achieve the organization\u2019s various goals. Overall, we contribute by offering an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use, demonstrating its usefulness in an important context, and discovering the importance of understanding in a new way the multilevel nature of information systems.

The second assumption we challenge is that existing measurement practices are unproblematic, even if researchers sometimes vary in how well they enact them.

We integrated a unique data set formed by a sample of 11,541 software development projects from an online outsourcing platform matched with archival sources on the language, time zone, culture, and IT development of countries.

Instead, we discover that increasing product variety diversifies the demand away from each movie title, but less significantly for hits than for niche products. In particular, we find that increasing product variety by 1,000 titles may increase the Gini coefficient of DVD rentals by 0.0029, which translates to increasing the market share of the top 1% of DVDs by 1.96% and the market share of the top 10% of DVDs by 0.58%. At the same time, the market share of the bottom 1% of DVDs is reduced by 21.29%, while the market share of the bottom 10% of DVDs is reduced by 5.28%.

Given the type and/or amount of information these technologies have the capability to capture, there have been some concerns among users and potential users. However, prominent technology adoption models tend to focus on only the positive utilities associated with technology use. This research leverages net valence theories, which incorporate both positive and negative utilities, and context of use literature to propose a general framework that can be used for understanding consumer acceptance of controversial information technologies. The framework also highlights the importance of incorporating contextual factors that reflect the nuances of the controversial technologies and their specific context of use. We apply the framework to consumer acceptance of biometric identity authentication for banking transactions through automated teller machines. To that end, we contextualize the core construct of perceived benefits and concerns to this domain in a qualitative study of 402 participants, determine the appropriate contextual factors that are antecedents of the contextualized core constructs by examining relevant past research, and then develop and validate a contextualized research model in a quantitative study of 437 participants.

However, rather than use the system directly, designated users may delegate some parts of their IS use to other users while assuming primary responsibility and accountability for the system use tasks. This behavior is called indirect IS use, a behavior that is acknowledged in some studies but not adequately scrutinized. This research distinguishes between direct and indirect IS use and proposes a model of their respective antecedents. The research was carried out in three stages. First, we conceptually distinguished direct and indirect IS use and drew on a social power lens to develop a theoretically driven research framework. Second, we contextually refined the research framework with a case study in a Confucian society. Third, we validated the research model through a survey of 213 Chinese physicians.

Economic Impacts of IT Overinvestment and Underinvestment","This study addresses the economic impacts of information technology (IT) overinvestment and underinvestment decisions. Based on the view of Red Queen competition in conjunction with institutional theory, we hypothesize that overinvestment and underinvestment in IT have nonlinear performance impacts. Drawing on the idea of management control mechanisms, we further hypothesize that the performance impacts are conditional on ownership concentration. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms, we find that, on average, there is a positive relationship between a firm\u2019s overinvestment in IT and Tobin\u2019s q, although that relationship attenuates at higher levels of overinvestment. However, there is, on average, no relationship between a firm\u2019s underinvestment in IT and its Tobin\u2019s q.

We build a two-period duopoly model in a market with herding consumers who have different preferences and are unsure of the quality difference between products. In addition, a firm\u2019s sales volume is uncertain because of the existence of \u201cirregular\u201d consumers. We find that the impacts of online reviews and sales volume information on firms\u2019 profits are mutually enhancing. The impact of such market-generated information depends on both product characteristics (the level of consumers\u2019 misfit for the nonpreferred product) and how consumers a priori perceive the quality difference between the products. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that more/accurate information is beneficial to high-quality firms, as well as consumers, we find that such information can be detrimental to firms, as firms adjust prices to induce, or react to, favorable market-generated information. Accordingly, consumers may not benefit from such market-generated information if the gain from less uncertainty cannot offset the loss from higher product prices. Such findings offer guidelines for firms to design better pricing strategies, as well as information policies, such as whether or not to promote more informative reviews.

However, developers face many challenges in bringing an ISD project to successful completion. These projects are often large and highly complex, with volatile targets, creating a stressful environment for developers. Although prior literature has considered how technical ISD risk factors, such as project size, complexity, and target volatility, affect team- and project-level outcomes, their effects on developers have received limited attention. This gap in the literature is problematic for two reasons: (1) the interplay between developers and project characteristics are unaccounted for, resulting in an incomplete picture of ISD; and (2) developer stress has been shown to reduce team performance. In this research, we examine the role of empowering leadership in reducing developer stress in ISD. We develop a multilevel model of the effect of empowering leadership on the relationship between technical ISD risk factors and developers\u2019 role perceptions, and explore the consequences for developers\u2019 stress. The model was tested in a field study of 350 developers in 73 ISD teams from a large U.S.-based firm. Results showed that empowering leadership ameliorated the negative effects of project size and target volatility on role ambiguity as well as the negative effects of project size, complexity, and target volatility on role conflict and stress. We also found that empowering leadership reduced role ambiguity, role conflict, and stress directly, and that role ambiguity and role conflict increased stress. Project size, complexity, and target volatility were found to increase empowering leadership behaviors. We conclude that empowering leadership can be an effective means of helping developers cope with technical ISD risk factors and discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice.

In this study, we investigate if and how information technology (IT) can help firms deal with this problem. We theorize that IT systems can help firms to cope with the complexity and inefficiency in managing innovation when R&D investments scale. We explicate the mechanisms through which IT enables firms to cope with the challenges they face when scaling their R&D and we posit that IT will mitigate the diminishing returns to R&D. Using archival data for 161 firms from 1991 to 2003 we find support for our conjecture that IT mitigates the diminishing returns to R&D. The mitigating effect of IT is stronger for firms facing greater complexity in their R&D activities, as measured by inventor intensity and geographical and technological complexity.

Uncertainty concerning online volunteer motivation has led to a growing body of academic research. This study contributes to that debate, by extending focus to CS volunteer work in nonprofit cultural institutions where no monetary benefit is offered to volunteers. This study examines motivations of high performing volunteers in a newspaper digitisation CS project, initiated by the National Library of Australia. Volunteers are motivated by personal, collective, and external factors, and these motivations change over time. Volunteers initially show intrinsic motivations, though both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations play a critical role in their continued participation. Volunteer contributions range from data shaping (e.g., correcting digitised optical character recognition data) to knowledge shaping (e.g., shaping historical data through tagging and commenting, but also through development of norms and social roles). The locus of motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic) also changes with different kinds of contributions. The distinction between data and knowledge shaping contributions, and the locus and focus of motivation behind these activities, has implications for the design of CS systems. Design for improved usability through cognitive and physical system affordances and development of social mechanisms for ongoing participation is discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0719","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['volunteers', 'motivation', 'cultural', 'nonprofit', 'participation']","The article discusses motivations of volunteers in a nonprofit context, highlighting themes of collective contribution and social roles, which align with moderate woke themes of community engagement and social impact.

Software diversity has been introduced as a strategy for disrupting such a monoculture and ultimately decreasing the risk of correlated failure. Nevertheless, common vulnerabilities can be shared by different software products. We thus expand software diversity research here and consider shared vulnerabilities between different software alternatives. We develop a combinatorial optimization model of software diversity on a network in an effort to identify the optimal software distribution that best improves network security. We also develop a simulation model of virus propagation based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible model.

I argue that index funds fit the profile of nonstrategic traders who, according to theory, are unambiguously more likely than managers and strategic investors to prefer high stock liquidity and thus high disclosure. This suggests that I can use index funds' disclosure preferences to construct an empirical model of voluntary disclosure that abstracts away from managers' strategic disclosure motives. Accordingly, I use an index-fund setting to construct a recursive structural equation model of voluntary disclosure, index fund ownership, and liquidity. I find that when a firm joins the S&P 500 index, voluntary disclosure increases with the level of ownership assumed by index funds, and this increase in disclosure is associated with increased stock liquidity.

Using a change in the legal environment in Delaware as an exogenous event, we document that a subset of firms with a relatively longer term focus (innovative firms) benefit from ATPs. Particularly, these firms experience an increase in Tobin's Q following a state law change in Delaware that increases the effectiveness of ATPs in defending against hostile takeovers. This increase is greater than that for non-innovative firms in Delaware as well as for innovative firms outside Delaware.

Using the setting of subsequent events, I identify the differential effect of requiring disclosure versus recognition in a setting where the accounting treatment of an item is exogenously determined. For comparable events, I find a stronger initial market response for firms required to recognize relative to firms that must disclose, although the large magnitude of the identified effect calls into question whether this difference can be attributed to accounting treatments alone. In examining various reasons for the stronger market response to recognized values, I fail to find support for the hypothesis that this difference is due to differential reliability of disclosed and recognized values.

We show that the effects of accounting disclosures on investment efficiency and investor welfare crucially depend on whether such disclosures convey information about the firm's future capital stock (i.e., balance sheet) or about its future operating cash flows (i.e., earnings). Specifically, investment efficiency and investor welfare unambiguously increase in the precision of disclosures that convey information about the future capital stock, since such disclosures mitigate the current owners' incentives to underinvest. In contrast, when accounting reports provide information about future cash flows, the firm can have incentives to either under- or overinvest depending on the precision of accounting reports and the expected growth in demand. For such disclosures, investment efficiency and investor welfare are maximized by an intermediate level of precision. The two types of accounting disclosures act as substitutes in that the precision of capital stock disclosures that maximizes investment efficiency (and investor welfare) decreases as cash flow disclosures become more informative and vice versa.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12161","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information disclosure and investment efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We first document economically and statistically significant income-decreasing earnings management around the initiation of an antidumping investigation. We show that earnings management increases when accounting data directly affect the magnitude of the tariffs imposed in the trade investigation. We also find that earnings management decreases as the number of petitioning firms increases or as the distance between petitioning firms increases, suggesting free-rider and coordination problems. We find that earnings management increases when the petition is directed at a country that imports more goods from the petitioning firm's home country, suggesting that retaliation threats affect incentives. We document that raising equity or debt financing moderates income-decreasing earnings management, consistent with the idea that sample firms trade off capital market and regulatory considerations. Our results indicate that contemporary research methods can detect accruals-based earnings management in settings in which the incentives for earnings management can be clearly identified.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12166","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management related to antidumping investigations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that when PCAOB inspectors report higher rates of deficiencies in internal control audits, auditors respond by increasing the issuance of adverse internal control opinions. We also find that auditors issue more adverse internal control opinions to clients with concurrent misstatements, who thus genuinely warrant adverse opinions.

Higher taxes reduce expected profits more for risky projects than for safe ones, as the government shares in a firm's upside but not in its downside. Consistent with this prediction, we find that risk taking is sensitive to taxes, albeit asymmetrically: the average firm reduces risk in response to a tax increase (primarily by changing its operating cycle and reducing R&D risk) but does not respond to a tax cut. We trace the asymmetry back to constraints on risk taking imposed by creditors. Finally, tax loss-offset rules moderate firms\u2019 sensitivity to taxes by allowing firms to partly share downside risk with the government.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12157","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['risk', 'taxes', 'corporate']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of corporate risk-taking in relation to tax rates, with no significant emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We find that securitized loans originated under the transparency regime are of better quality with a lower default probability, a lower delinquent amount, fewer days in delinquency, and lower losses upon default. Additionally, banks with more intensive loan level information collection and those operating under stronger market discipline experience greater improvement in their loan quality under the new reporting standards.

This reduction was most severe in the regions that experienced the most significant construction growth. These trends reversed during the subsequent housing crisis in 2008\u20132011 when construction activity contracted.

As such, theory (Jensen and Meckling [1976]) suggests that inside debt holdings negatively impact CEO risk-appetite. To the extent that corporate tax shelters are likely to result in high cash flow volatility in the future, we expect that inside debt holdings will curb CEOs from engaging in tax shelter transactions. Consistent with the prediction, we document a negative association between CEO inside debt holdings and tax sheltering. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of inside debt on tax sheltering is more (less) pronounced in the presence of high default risk and liquidity threats (cash-out options in pension packages).

The result is robust to using firms\u2019 number of items in financial statements and exposure to complex accounting rules as alternative proxies for errors and to using the restatement amount in net income to quantify the magnitude of bias and errors.

In contrast, although auditors do not adjust fully even when misstatements are known with certainty, social bonding has no effect in this scenario. Accordingly, our experiment contributes beyond the main effects of social bonding and measurement uncertainty demonstrated in prior research by showing that these forces interact.

The idea is that support plays an information-generating role in that it renders output more informative about employees' abilities. This effect reduces the need to gather additional information about ability via costly monitoring and commits the firm to make replacement/promotion decisions that are more sensitive to performance. Consequently, support indirectly strengthens employees' career concern incentives and reduces the pressure on costly bonus payments.

Evidence from the Indian Companies Act 2013","In 2013, a new law required Indian firms, which satisfy certain profitability, net worth, and size thresholds, to spend at least 2% of their net income on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We exploit this regulatory change to isolate the shareholder value implications of CSR activities. Using an event study approach coupled with a regression discontinuity design, we find that the law, on average, caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price of firms forced to spend money on CSR. However, firms that spend more on advertising are not negatively affected by the mandatory CSR rule. These results suggest that firms voluntarily choose CSR to maximize shareholder value. Therefore, forcing a firm to spend on CSR is likely to be sub-optimal for the firm with a consequent negative impact on shareholder value.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12174","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['Corporate Social Responsibility', 'shareholder value', 'regulatory change']","The article discusses Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of a regulatory requirement, indicating some awareness of ethical business practices.

At the firm level, borrowers facing higher uncertainty are more likely to write contracts that include GAAP changes, but these firms also show a more pronounced time-trend toward excluding GAAP changes.

Using a sample of 11,963 plans, we find that the regulated liability exceeds the unregulated measure by 10% and the difference further increases for underfunded pension plans.

Our approach is based on the role of materiality (as well as meanings) and multi-temporality in heirloom consumption. The data generated through interviews, visual sources, and media documents reveal three rejuvenation processes that, given particular boundary conditions, renew heirlooms: uncovering, refreshing, and reconciliation. Our study also distinguishes three types of heirloom essence that can survive the heirloom\u2019s material and compositional transformations. Rejuvenation reintegrates the heirloom into the heir\u2019s life trajectory by imbuing it with a zeitgeist value and the heir\u2019s presence, helping the heir to better navigate her imaginaries of the past, present, and future. Beyond the ritualistic consumption or curation of heirlooms, our findings reveal a creative, playful, and proactive relation with heirlooms, evocative of craftwork. Moreover, the market, within particular boundaries, can help authenticate heirloom objects and facilitate their inalienability rather than necessarily destroying their authenticity. Our study has implications for the role of heirloom consumption in consumers\u2019 negotiations of continuity and change, the interaction of the symbolic and the material in heirlooms, and the inalienability\u2013market relation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/1/2379668","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['identity', 'change', 'continuity', 'consumption', 'symbolic']","The article discusses themes of identity and change in the context of heirloom consumption, suggesting a moderate engagement with social constructs.

The current research broadens this view, arguing that people additionally experience varying degrees of decision comfort that are distinct from other post-decision evaluations. The authors argue that comfort is a soft-positive emotion thus far unexamined in relation to decision processes and present nine studies that (1) develop and validate two scales to measure decision comfort, (2) demonstrate the discriminant validity of decision comfort relative to numerous other post-decision constructs, and (3) examine the unique downstream consequences of decision comfort. The results show that an individual may be quite comfortable with a decision despite being uncertain about the optimality and/or the anticipated consequences of that decision (e.g., satisfaction or regret).

In a set of nine studies, the PSO scale is developed and its nomological, test-retest, discriminant, and predictive validities are established. The results also show that the PSO moderates the relationship between consumers\u2019 financial knowledge and their accumulated savings. Additionally, low-PSO consumers are responsive to an intervention to help them save money. The PSO offers an effective method for understanding differences between consumers in their financial decision making and behaviors, and it can be used as a guide to encourage consistent and sustained saving practices.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/134/2379613","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['savings', 'financial decision making', 'sustainable']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and financial decision-making without a significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This research explores the unique ways in which consumers respond to ads using this type of targeting (vs. to ads that use more traditional forms of targeting), demonstrating that a behaviorally targeted ad can act as a social label even when it contains no explicit labeling information. Instead, when consumers recognize that the marketer has made an inference about their identity in order to serve them the ad, the ad itself functions as an implied social label. Across four studies, behaviorally targeted ads lead consumers to make adjustments to their self-perceptions to match the implied label; these self-perceptions then impact behavior including purchase intentions for the advertised product and other behaviors related to the implied label. Importantly, these effects only hold when the label is plausibly connected to consumers\u2019 prior behavior (i.e., when the targeting is at least moderately accurate).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/156/2379732","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['targeting', 'social labels', 'identity', 'self-perceptions']","The article discusses how behaviorally targeted ads can function as social labels, influencing consumer identity and self-perception.

Four studies were conducted. The results show that under baseline conditions, consumers who believe they can control the environment (internal locus of control) show greater confidence in their emerging preference in a choice process and demonstrate higher levels of preference-supporting bias than consumers who believe the environment controls their fate (external locus of control). However, the opposite relationship between locus of control and confirmatory information processing occurs when a threat to personal control is encountered. When threatened, consumers with an internal (external) locus of control activate an accuracy (defense) goal that results in lower (higher) levels of confidence in their emerging preference and confirmatory information processing than consumers with an external (internal) locus of control. These findings are integrated within a general framework that accounts for the impact of personal control on information processing. The framework predicts and empirical evidence confirms that the alternative strategies adopted to process information at different levels of personal control affect both product choice and willingness to pay for a new product.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/179/2379740","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['personal control', 'information processing', 'consumer choice']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The valence of the persuasion outcome depends heavily on trust cues that change the meaning of boasting to the word-of-mouth recipient. Boasting in the presence of low trust cues activates heightened vigilance (e.g., valenced thoughts) about the source\u2019s motives, leading to decreased persuasion.

Negative disconfirmation is often associated with negative posttrial evaluations. However, the authors find that when negative sensory disconfirmation is introduced by an exciting brand, the source of disconfirmation can sometimes be perceived positively. This occurs because consumers intuitively view disconfirmation as more authentic of an exciting personality. Similarly, despite the wealth of literature linking positive disconfirmation to positive posttrial evaluations, the authors find that sensory confirmation is more preferred for sincere brands because consumers intuitively view confirmation as more authentic of a sincere personality. The authors conclude by demonstrating the intuitive nature of this phenomenon by showing that the lay belief linking brand personality to disconfirmation does not activate in a context where sensory disconfirmation encourages a more deliberative assessment of the product.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/44/2379589","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['brand personality', 'disconfirmation', 'authenticity']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and brand perception without addressing social justice or ethical considerations.

An agentic-communal model of power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences. Compared to low-power states, high-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence, high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result, low-power communicators generate messages with greater warmth information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power audience members.

But the content (e.g., stories, news, information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways. Sometimes people find content themselves, and other times people receive content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how? Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content, people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting or well written), which reduces these characteristics\u2019 impact on sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting (than boring) content, the difference is attenuated (and in some cases, disappeared) among finders. These findings deepen insights into the psychological drivers of word of mouth and shed light on how contextual factors, content characteristics, and the self interact to drive social transmission.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/86/2379577","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the psychological drivers of word of mouth and content acquisition methods without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Implicit in our view is the idea that researchers should know how to create valuable knowledge and be able to anticipate how much stakeholders will appreciate that knowledge.

Eight studies examine how the variety among the activities that fill people\u2019s day-to-day lives affects subsequent happiness. The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people\u2019s sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and leisure, self-selected and imposed, social and solo).

This research shows that the temporal arrangement of effort investment and reward dispensation can affect people\u2019s motivation to earn more rewards. Two procedures for acquiring rewards are examined: a piecemeal procedure, whereby rewards are acquired gradually through repeated small efforts, and a lump-sum procedure, whereby a number of rewards are acquired all at once after a longer period of work. Holding constant the total quantity of acquired rewards and the effort\u2013reward exchange rate, the piecemeal procedure is more motivating than the lump-sum procedure (experiment 1) because the former results in a greater sense of achievement (experiment\u00a02). If the sense of achievement is curtailed by preventing people from accumulating the rewards they have earned (experiment\u00a03), by providing rewards that are different from the already-earned rewards (experiment\u00a04), or by breaking the association between effort and rewards (experiment\u00a05), the piecemeal procedure is no more motivating than the lump-sum procedure. The effect is also diminished when consumers are satiated with the rewards (experiment 6).

However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer\u2019s identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers\u2019 motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer\u2019s identity. This occurs because placing an identity-linked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/246/2572264","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identity', 'recycle', 'disposal', 'consumer behavior']","The article discusses the influence of consumer identity on recycling behaviors, which touches on themes of sustainability and ethical consumerism.

When others\u2019 status is not superior (similar or inferior), high-PDB consumers are more likely to engage in status consumption than low-PDB consumers. However, when others\u2019 status is superior, high-PDB consumers are less likely to engage in status consumption. Both signaling effectiveness and need for status underlie the effect of PDB on status consumption. Need for status mediates the effect of PDB only when others\u2019 status is not superior, whereas signaling effectiveness mediates the effect of PDB on status consumption when others\u2019 status is superior, similar, or inferior. Compared to low-PDB consumers, high-PDB consumers perceive greater signaling effectiveness when others\u2019 status is inferior or similar, but they perceive less signaling effectiveness, and therefore engage in less status consumption, when others\u2019 status is superior.

To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals\u2019 perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants\u2019 perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as individuals\u2019 motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/282/2572275","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['autonomy', 'enjoyment', 'humanlike features']","The article discusses the impact of anthropomorphized helpers on consumer autonomy and enjoyment, touching on themes of individual autonomy but primarily focusing on consumer behavior in gaming rather than broader social justice or ethical critiques.

Earlier research has identified a number of ways in which consumers respond differently to precise versus round numbers. The current research attempts to enrich this literature by introducing a new theoretical perspective. Drawing on recent findings in the numerical cognition literature, this work proposes that individuals project gendered meanings to precise versus round numbers, with precise numbers seen as more masculine relative to round ones. Seven studies provided convergent evidence for this proposition and demonstrated its marketing implications. Studies 1, 2, and 3, employing various approaches, show that participants do subscribe to this precision-masculinity intuition, at both implicit and explicit levels. Study 4 suppresses this effect by priming participants with examples where precision is connected to femininity.

Three studies show that consumers high (vs. low) in power distance belief have a greater tendency to use price to judge quality because they have a greater need for structure, which makes them more likely to discriminate between brands and rank them based on price. The relationships held regardless of whether the price-to-quality relation was assessed using a standard self-report scale or via actual product judgments, and whether power distance belief was measured or manipulated. The effect was found to be independent of self-construal, holistic thinking, and risk aversion, was mediated by a need for structure, and disappeared when the tendency to order was facilitated (impeded) by making price more (less) salient.

Although intuitively, believing in karma should result in greater intentions to do right by supporting a charity, karmic beliefs are found to facilitate prosocial behavior only in contexts not associated with self-gains. A series of experiments shows that those with strong (vs. weak) beliefs in karma actually respond less favorably to charitable appeals that rely on common marketing tools meant to enhance consumer responses but that also cue self-gains by offering incentives or by highlighting self-benefits. However, these effects are only obtained for donations of time, which represent a means to enhance social connections, but not for donations of money. Consistent with the proposition that prosocial behaviors motivated by self-gains do not engender karmic rewards, lower intentions to do right among those with strong karmic beliefs are driven by a shift from other-focused to self-focused attention following appeals that cue self-gains, as compared to appeals that do not. Results imply that marketers need to take into account consumers\u2019 karmic beliefs when seeking to incentivize prosocial behavior.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/334/2572285","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['prosocial behavior', 'charitable', 'self-gains', 'karmic beliefs']","The article explores themes of prosocial behavior and charitable appeals, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and ethical considerations in marketing.

Findings reveal that preferences for compromise alternatives replicate in mixed-gender and female-female dyads as among individuals but are attenuated when two males make a choice together. Moreover, when two males make joint choices, their tendency to choose the compromise alternative decreases not only relative to other types of pairs but also to male and female individual decision makers. Evidence is presented that this happens because male-male dyadic contexts cue gender dichotomization, behavior that is consistent with masculine but not feminine gender norms. Because the extremity in decision making is maximally consistent with masculine but not feminine gender role norms, male-male dyads exhibit lower preferences for compromise options. However, if men have an opportunity to signal masculinity to one another prior to making joint compromise choices, male-male dyads prefer compromise options at proportions no different from female-female dyads. This work brings together the judgment and decision-making literature with insights from the social psychology literature, identifying a case when gender role norms have profound influences on classic judgment and decision-making effects.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/355/2200141","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['gender', 'compromise', 'norms', 'decision-making', 'masculinity']","The article explores gender differences in decision-making and the influence of gender norms, which aligns with moderate woke themes related to gender equity and social psychology.

However, the process of recalling and thinking about a nostalgic experience can have quite different effects. Because nostalgic experiences rarely reoccur, people are motivated to savor them by prolonging the time they reminisce about them. The tendency to savor these experiences generalizes to situations that participants encounter later, thus increasing consumer patience. For this effect to emerge, however, consumers must be aware that waiting will be beneficial to the attainment of a benefit. Moreover, the relationship between nostalgia and consumer patience is diminished when people perceive a nostalgic experience to be repeatable or when they intensify their memory of the experience rather than prolonging it.

Hedonic escalation is more likely to occur when (1) a palatable food consists of a complex combination of flavors, and (2) a person is motivated to taste additional flavors on each successive bite. Consequently, hedonic escalation is more prevalent when people can identify more flavors (pilot study), attend to additional flavors on each taste trial (study 1), have an opportunity to identify an additional flavor on each taste trial (study 2), and isolate distinct flavors on each taste trial (study 3). Changes in hedonic escalation can be attributed to increased sensitization to flavors as opposed to changes in the rate of habituation (study 4). Hedonic escalation can also increase consumption (study 5) and influence food choices (study 6).

The number, the nature, and the relative salience of progress markers along a walking path toward a physical location communicate goal progress and thus the motivation to reach a particular destination. Consistent with a goal gradient account, customers walk faster when fewer progress markers are placed along the walking path to the goal. The effect of the number of progress markers diminishes when the markers are unrelated to the goal and reverses when the markers are relatively more salient than the goal. This article contributes to the goal literature by showing how markers affect perceptions of goal progress (i.e., level vs. rate of progress) and provides concrete insights to speed up and slow down customers\u2019 walking speed in a retail environment.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/407/2198479","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing customer traffic flow in retail environments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We theorize that the two strategies of\nproblem-focused versus emotion-focused coping are systematically associated with distinct\nconstrual levels (lower vs. higher), and thus messages cast at different levels of\nconstrual are differentially effective when a particular coping strategy is being\nactivated. Specifically, we demonstrate that consumers primed with problem-focused\nstrategies are more persuaded by messages presented at lower levels of construal, whereas\nconsumers primed with emotion-focused strategies are more persuaded by messages presented\nat higher levels of construal. In addition, we posit that matching with each different\ntype of coping strategy (problem-focused vs. emotion-focused coping) is driven by distinct\ntypes of efficacy processes. In particular, we demonstrate that the effects of a match\nwith problem-focused coping are driven by self-efficacy, and the effects of a match with\nemotion-focused coping are driven by response efficacy.

In managing their debt over time, these consumers must decide how to allocate repayments across their debt accounts. This research examines how different monthly repayment allocations, varying from entirely concentrated into one debt account (i.e., a concentrated strategy) to equally dispersed across all debt accounts (i.e., a dispersed strategy), influence consumers\u2019 motivation to repay their debts. Evidence from a field study of indebted consumers with multiple debt accounts and from three experiments shows that concentrated (vs. dispersed) repayment strategies tend to boost consumers\u2019 motivation to become debt free, leading them to repay their debts more aggressively. Importantly, this motivating effect is most pronounced when the repayments are concentrated into consumers\u2019 smallest accounts because consumers tend to infer overall progress in debt repayment from the greatest proportional balance reduction (proportion of starting balance repaid) within any one account. These findings advance our understanding of how consumers repay their debts and help pinpoint the psychological process by which debt repayment strategies affect consumers\u2019 motivation to get out of debt.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/460/2200459","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['debt', 'motivation', 'repayment']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior related to debt repayment strategies, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The current work demonstrates an important case in which consideration targets are resistant to particular inferences, which leads such inferences to be applied instead to one\u2019s environment. Specifically, when considering safety-oriented products, consumers exposed to unstable-looking brand logos infer the presence of unsafe conditions, and because safety-oriented products are resistant to inferences that they are unsafe, the inference is instead applied to the environment (i.e., \u201cthe environment is unsafe\u201d). This process subsequently increases the perceived utility of safety-oriented products.

This study expands research on value creation by adopting a circulation-centric perspective that explains how value is created systemically in collaborative consumer networks. Inspired by anthropological theories of value creation, this study examines how circulation enables the systemic creation of value by connecting networked participants, their actions, objects, and value outcomes. Ethnographic and netnographic data were collected on the collaborative network of geocaching, in which consumers promote the circulation of objects known as travel bugs. The systemic creation of value in collaborative consumer networks is composed of four subprocesses triggered by object circulation\u2014enactment, transvaluation, assessment, and alignment\u2014that may happen concurrently and in multiple iterations. This process explains how geographic dispersion can coexist with the cultural situatedness of value creation and helps integrate prior research on value creation and value outcomes through the development of a systemic framework that explains value creation in terms of both individual actions and collective outcomes. Moreover, the findings motivate discussion on the affordances of physical and digital objects for value creation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/509/2630502","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['collaborative', 'value creation', 'community', 'consumer networks']","The article discusses value creation in collaborative consumer networks, which implies a focus on community and collective outcomes.

This occurs because a loss of control puts consumers at a deficit relative to one of the major lessons they learn during their childhood, which is to have control over the outcomes of their actions. This deficit triggers a compensatory process focused on following other lessons that consumers believe they learned during their childhood. Because exerting self-regulation is another major lesson parents emphasize, consumers engage in self-regulatory behavior to compensate for a loss of personal control. However, when consumers believe their parents emphasized self-regulation less strongly during childhood (i.e., they believe their parents had a more permissive style), a loss of control can reduce self-regulatory behavior. These findings have implications for what we know about the effects of childhood experiences on adult consumer behavior, the importance of individuals\u2019 beliefs about childhood experiences in determining adult behavior, the consequences of low personal control, and the antecedents of self-regulatory behavior.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/534/2630506","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-regulation', 'control', 'consumer behavior']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and the psychological implications of childhood lessons, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Specifically, this research focuses on a common and yet little studied brand design element: logo frames. The authors propose that a logo frame may be perceived as either protecting or confining, depending on the level of risk associated with a purchase. A high perception of risk increases the accessibility of a logo frame\u2019s association with protection and increases purchase intent, whereas a low perception of risk increases the accessibility of a logo frame\u2019s association with confinement and decreases purchase intent. The authors also propose that the logo frame effect may, under certain situations, extend to secondary brand identifiers (e.g., brand slogans) but will not extend to elements unrelated to brand identity (e.g., product descriptions). Six studies provide support for these propositions. The findings of this research contribute to the literature on symbolic associations by demonstrating the contingent nature of the symbolic associations triggered from a visual design element and by showing that design features can mitigate (and under certain circumstances reverse) the negative effect of increased risk perceptions on purchase intent.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/549/2630525","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['symbolic associations', 'design elements', 'brand identity']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of visual design and its impact on consumer behavior, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The Green-Feminine Stereotype and Its Effect on Sustainable Consumption","Why are men less likely than women to embrace environmentally friendly products and behaviors? Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this green-feminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men\u2019s willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, gender-identity maintenance can influence men\u2019s likelihood of adopting green behaviors.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/567/2630509","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['sustainable consumption', 'gender gap', 'green behavior', 'femininity', 'masculinity']","The article explores the intersection of gender identity and environmental sustainability, highlighting how societal stereotypes about femininity and masculinity influence consumer behavior.

However, this technology is not always used effectively. For example, many consumers skip checking Terms and Conditions links even when a quick evaluation of the terms can save them money, but they check their smartphone while driving even though this behavior is illegal and dangerous. Four laboratory experiments clarify the significance of one contributor to such contradictory deviations from effective checking. Studies 1, 2, and 3 show that, like basic decisions from experience, checking decisions reflect underweighting of rare events, which in turn is a sufficient condition for the coexistence of insufficient and too much checking. Insufficient checking emerges when most checking efforts impair performance even if checking is effective on average. Too much checking emerges when most checking clicks are rewarding even if checking is counterproductive on average.

Study 4 shows that when the goal is to increase checking, interventions that increase the probability that checking leads to the best possible outcome can be far more effective than efforts to reduce the cost of checking.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/583/2444573","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to technology use without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The Role of Processing Mode","The influence of psychological distance on construal level has been extensively documented in both social psychology and consumer research, with proximal (distal) events shown to induce low-level (high-level) construals. However, the extant literature takes a black box approach, as it were, to this effect by viewing it in terms of a direct association between distance and construal level, without specifying any intervening variables. The current research seeks to unpack this black box and provide more detailed process insights by identifying such an intervening variable: processing mode. We argue that people tend to rely more on visual processing when construing proximal events while engaging in a greater degree of verbal processing with regard to distal targets; in turn, visual processing is more likely to yield concrete (low-level) representations, whereas verbal processing facilitates abstract (high-level) representations. This unpacked formulation not only provides additional theoretical insight into a classic effect but also yields implications that are novel to the literature. In particular, emphasizing the role of processing mode (1) enables an identification of boundary conditions for the distance-construal effect, and (2) indicates when and why well-established consequences of psychological distance on consumer preferences can be reversed. Results from five studies provide convergent support for our key proposition and its corollaries.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/4/598/2630512","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on psychological distance and construal levels in consumer research without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This research shows that changing a task from choice to rejection makes people more likely to rely on deliberative processing, what we label the task-type effect. To demonstrate this effect, we use a set of established decision biases that can be attenuated under deliberative processing. We show that changing a task from choice to rejection makes people express more consistent preferences between safe and risky options in the Asian disease problem (study 1A) and in financial decision making (study 1B), even with real monetary consequences (study 1C). Further, switching a task from choice to rejection increases the quality of consideration sets in the context of hotel reviews (study 2) and leads to more rational decisions in the context of cell phone plan selection (study 3). Studies 4 and 5 tap into the process underlying the effect of task type. We demonstrate that a rejection task produces decisions similar to those observed in a choice task when decision makers are cognitively depleted (study 4) or encouraged to rely on their feelings (study 5).

Effects depend upon participation in the network, which can be private, public, or professional. Private participation tends to discipline passion into interests reflecting established cultural categories. Public and professional participation build new connections between extant desires and a wider network, decentering ties and deterritorializing flows that limit hungers to emplaced bodies. Public and professional participation drive consumption passion to transgressive extremes. We use ethnography and netnography to study online food image sharing, a broad field that includes everything from friend networks to food bloggers. Using and extending Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s desire theory, we conceptualize desire as energetic, connective, systemic, and innovative. Critically examining the role of technocapitalism in the realm of consumption passion, we question the emancipatory possibilities of unfettered desire.

Because construal of the distant (vs. near) future generally focuses on high-level (vs. low-level) features, when consumers visualize the distant (vs. near) future, they should engage in processing that captures shape (vs. color): namely, imagery that is relatively more black and white (vs. colorful). Experiment 1 establishes that shape is a constant focus of visualization regardless of the temporal distance of future events, whereas the focus on color decreases as temporal distance increases. Using image matching, image reconstruction, and behavioral response time measures, respectively, experiments 2A, 2B, 2C, 3, and 4 test and find that participants\u2019 visualization of the distant (vs. near) future is increasingly less colorful (i.e., more black and white). Experiment 5 establishes the underlying mechanism, showing that experimentally directing attention to high-level (vs. low-level) features directly promotes visualization that is less colorful (i.e., more black and white). Experiments 6A and 6B apply these findings to visual communications, suggesting that marketing messages about distant (vs. near) future events lead to greater willingness to pay when presented alongside black-and-white (vs. color) images.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/5/707/2688908","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and visual perception without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Extant research shows these systems\u2019 effects on many aspects of consumer behavior, from information search and memory to strategies for participating in status games. This study extends consumer research by illuminating how these taste evaluation systems are constituted in consumers, after habitus has instilled generic dispositions in them. The multimethod ethnography studies US middle-class, male craft beer aficionados seeking to become connoisseurs. This work makes two main contributions to consumer research. First, it places the often-neglected world of the senses at the center of taste theorizing. It details three learning practices (benchmarking, autodidactics, and scaffolding) that consumers use to bind together the sensory and discursive dimensions of social practices. Second, it reveals interconsumer cooperation as a key mechanism in building consensus on social practices that involve ambiguous aesthetic experiences. This theorization complements prior research on status competition as a dominant type of sociality in taste-centered consumption domains.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/5/726/2444579","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['cultural competence', 'aesthetic expertise', 'social practices']","The article discusses cultural competence and social practices in consumer behavior, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics.

Six studies demonstrate this effect and further show that it is driven by hedonic responses as a result of favorable uncertainty resolution.

For instance, a medical drug with a potential side effect of seizures is viewed as less threatening when it also has smaller potential side effects, such as congestion and fatigue; travel insurance covering serious injury is viewed as less attractive when it also covers minor ailments; a lottery offering a chance to win an iPad is viewed as less attractive when it also offers a chance to win smaller prizes. As a result, consumers can perceive normatively more dangerous (beneficial) options to be less dangerous (beneficial) and normatively less dangerous (beneficial) options to be more dangerous (beneficial). This effect arises because people believe that larger prospects (e.g., seizures) are less likely than smaller prospects (e.g., congestion). Therefore, inclusion of smaller prospects by contrast makes a larger prospect appear less likely, which in turn reduces the perceived value of the risky option. Thus, this effect arises only when smaller prospects are added to a larger prospect, and only when the prospects are probabilistic. Cognitive load and feelings of personal control also moderate the effect.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/5/769/2418165","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive biases related to risk perception without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

This is often accomplished through the use of life-enhancing products, sometimes referred to as performance-enhancing products, which can be accessed only through a gatekeeper, such as a physician. Integrating consumer and medical research, this article investigates how physicians make trade-offs between objective medical and nonmedical factors to determine consumers\u2019 access to life-enhancing products by examining US pediatric endocrinologists\u2019 prescription decisions for growth hormone (GH) for healthy but short children. The results of a conjoint study indicate that consumer medical criteria have less impact on a physician\u2019s decision to prescribe GH if the consumer requests a prescription or the physician believes in the intangible product benefits, and more impact when the product is more expensive.

Families and consumption are at the nexus of the problem, as childhood weight issues depend significantly on family-related influences (genetic predispositions, physical activities, and household food consumption practices). This article focuses on how a family socializes a child toward or away from obesity. It advances a family consumer socialization framework to characterize key elements and processes. Biological predispositions, parent/family inputs, elements of child development, parent-child interactions, and intergenerational transfer are all major contributors to weight status and life course potentials. Time is also a crucial component, here represented in two forms\u2014linear and cyclical.

The Effect of Anthropomorphism on Product Attribute Processing and Consumer PreferenceGet access","The present research finds that anthropomorphism, or attributing human characteristics to nonhuman objects, increases consumers\u2019 preference for products with superior appearance. This effect occurs because consumers apply the belief of \u201cbeautiful is good,\u201d a pervasive stereotype in person perception, to the judgment of anthropomorphized products. Seven experiments test the propositions. The results show that product anthropomorphism (vs. nonanthropomorphism) leads consumers to spend more time and money searching for information about appearance attributes (experiments 1 and 2), to indicate greater preference for products with superior appearance (experiments 4, 6, and 7), and to purchase products with superior appearance (experiments 3 and 5). The experiments also show that the effect of anthropomorphism on consumer preference is mediated by consumers\u2019 conviction of \u201cbeautiful is good\u201d in person perception. This effect is alleviated when consumers\u2019 beliefs about the association between the attractive physical appearance of a person and the positive personal traits of this person are challenged. These results are robust across a wide range of product categories and consumers.

Study 1 demonstrates this basic effect in a field setting involving real purchases, while studies 2 and 3 show that framing a product as utilitarian (vs. hedonic) moderates the effect of control on purchase intentions.

However, sentiment analysis, the process of automatically distilling sentiment from text, provides little insight regarding the language granularities beyond the use of positive and negative words. Drawing on speech act theory, this study provides a fine-grained analysis of the implicit and explicit language used by consumers to express sentiment in text. An empirical text-mining study using more than 45,000 consumer reviews demonstrates the differential impacts of activation levels (e.g., tentative language), implicit sentiment expressions (e.g., commissive language), and discourse patterns (e.g., incoherence) on overall consumer sentiment (i.e., star ratings). In two follow-up studies, we demonstrate that these speech act features also influence the readers\u2019 behavior and are generalizable to other social media contexts, such as Twitter and Facebook. We contribute to research on consumer sentiment analysis by offering a more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments and their implications.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/6/875/2801804","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['sentiment', 'consumer', 'language', 'discourse']","The article focuses on sentiment analysis in consumer reviews, which touches on consumer behavior but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Experiments examining actual gift exchanges in real-life relationships reveal that experiential gifts produce greater improvements in relationship strength than material gifts, regardless of whether the gift giver and recipient consume the gift together.

We argue that such planning may also involve the time window within which a given quantity needs to be consumed because the final objective is to plan for a desired consumption rate (i.e., quantity/time window)\u2014a high virtue rate and a low vice rate. Five studies reveal that, when quantity is held constant, a short window (i.e., high rate) nudges individuals toward virtues, and a long window (i.e., low rate) toward vices. We find this effect for hypothetical and real virtue-vice choices, preferences, and willingness to extend a time window. Furthermore, these effects are mediated by the pursuit of long-term health goals, and are moderated such that the effect of time windows is stronger for those who need more help in meeting their self-control goals\u2014that is, impulsive individuals. While these effects are consistent with self-control, we discuss a blend of mechanisms that may be working in conjunction, particularly at the stage that we focus on: planning rather than consuming.

Based on ethnographic research conducted in New York City, it provides evidence that remembering and forgetting can coexist and interconnect in complex ways. Uncovering the mechanics of forgetting in memory practices with souvenirs, it takes the research on memory and material culture beyond the semiotic analysis of signs and symbols, and shows that souvenirs can play a fundamental role in the process of obliterating and/or compartmentalizing aspects of past experiences.

This research examines consumer beliefs about product differentiation. For a wide variety of product pairs, different consumers hold divergent beliefs about whether each pair is a matter of quality (such that one product is objectively better) or taste (such that one product is a better match with their own personal preferences). These beliefs have meaningful consequences. When consumers believe their chosen products are objectively better rather than better matches with their preferences: (1) they are willing to pay more for the chosen product over the alternative; (2) they self-reference less when explaining their choices; and (3) they are more likely to make transitive inferences from choices across other consumers.

This research examines an intuition at the crossroads of two important criteria for food decision making\u2014healthiness and price\u2014finding that consumers believe that healthier food is more expensive than less healthy food. While this relationship may be accurate in some cases, consumers overgeneralize this belief to contexts and product categories where it is not objectively true. As a result, the healthy = expensive intuition influences consumer decision making by impacting inferences of missing attributes and choice between alternatives. Further, consistent with dual process models, the intuition acts as a bias in shaping how consumers process information about health and price when consumers are processing heuristically, including altering both perceptions of how \u201chealthy\u201d a given ingredient is as a function of product price and the amount of information search consumers engage in when evaluating health claims, such that consumers have a higher standard of evidence when evaluating intuition-inconsistent claims.

We construct a parsimonious model where heterogeneous households have recursive preferences. A single state variable drives the conditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth. The estimated model fits well the unconditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth and the moments of the risk-free rate, equity premium, price-dividend ratio, and aggregate dividend and consumption growth. The model-implied risk-free rate and price-dividend ratio are procyclical, while the market return has countercyclical mean and variance. Finally, household consumption risk explains the cross section of excess returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12471","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and household consumption risk without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Results show that institutions concentrate trading around certain ex-dates, and earn higher profits around these events. Dividend capture trades represent 6% of all institutional buy trades but contribute 15% of overall abnormal returns. Institutional dividend capture trading is persistent. Institutional ex-day profitability is also strongly cross-sectionally related to trade execution skill. The relation between execution skill and profits disappears around placebo non-ex-days.

We show that, over the life cycle, households progressively shift from growth to value as they become older and their balance sheets improve.

We use confidential data on banks\u2019 internal ratings on loans to businesses over the period 1997 to 2011 from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending. We find that ex ante risk-taking by banks (measured by the risk rating of new loans) is negatively associated with increases in short-term interest rates.

Despite rapid growth in this market, only 1.9% of eligible homeowners had RMLs in 2013. In this paper, we analyze reverse mortgages in a calibrated life-cycle model of retirement. The average welfare gain from RMLs is $252 per homeowner, and $1,770 per RML borrower. Bequest motives, uncertainty about health and expenses, and loan costs account for low demand. According to the model, the Great Recession's impact differs across age, income, and wealth distributions, with a threefold increase in RML demand for lowest income and oldest households.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12489","articles","JF","Finance","3","['welfare', 'income', 'households']","The article discusses welfare gains and the impact of reverse mortgage loans on different income and age groups, indicating some awareness of social equity issues.

Risky assets represent 40% of firms\u2019 financial portfolios, or 6% of total book assets. We present a formal model to assess the optimality of this behavior. Consistent with the model, risky assets are concentrated in financially unconstrained firms holding large financial portfolios, are held by poorly governed firms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets. We conclude that this activity represents an unregulated asset management industry of more than $1.5 trillion, questioning the traditional boundaries of nonfinancial firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12490","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial asset management without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

I show this result using a costly enforcement model in which lenders need ex post incentives to enforce payments from defaulted loans and borrowers' payoffs are correlated. When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one project (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects. A large correlated portfolio provides ex post incentives for enforcement. Thus, intermediation dominates direct lending, and intermediaries are financed with risk-free deposits, earn positive profits, and hold systemic default risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12493","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial intermediation and loan management without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

Using the mortgage market as a laboratory, we conjecture that lenders with a large share of outstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and thus are less inclined to foreclose. We provide evidence consistent with our conjecture. Arguably as a consequence, zip codes with a higher concentration of outstanding mortgages experience smaller house prices declines.

Using a large firm-level data set, we show that capital account liberalization decreases the dispersion in the return to capital across firms, particularly in sectors more dependent on external finance. We provide evidence that capital account liberalization improves capital allocation by allowing financially constrained firms to demand more capital and produce at a more efficient level. Finally, using a model of misallocation we document that capital account liberalization increases aggregate productivity through more efficient capital allocation by 10% to 16%.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12497","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on capital account liberalization and its effects on productivity and firm capital allocation, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

High-CSR firms also experienced higher profitability, growth, and sales per employee relative to low-CSR firms, and they raised more debt. This evidence suggests that the trust between a firm and both its stakeholders and investors, built through investments in social capital, pays off when the overall level of trust in corporations and markets suffers a negative shock.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12505","articles","JF","Finance","5","['corporate social responsibility', 'social capital', 'trust']","The article discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its impact on firm performance during a financial crisis, indicating a moderate focus on ethical business practices and stakeholder trust.

We find that 85% of all advance refundings occur at a net present value loss, and that the aggregate losses over the past 20 years exceed $15 billion. We explore why municipalities advance refund their debt at loss. Financially constrained municipalities may face pressure to advance refund since it allows them to reduce short-term cash outflows.

This time-series relation between turnover and performance is stronger than the cross-sectional relation, as the model predicts. Also as predicted, the turnover-performance relation is stronger for funds trading less-liquid stocks and funds likely to possess greater skill. Turnover is correlated across funds.

The first approach estimates the liquidity component using transaction data, the second measures the default component with credit default swap data, and the third is a quasi-natural experiment that estimates changes in default risk around pre-refunding events.

With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t > 3 will produce a large number of false positives.

Empirically, we find that firms with low loadings on labor market tightness outperform firms with high loadings by 6% annually. We propose a partial equilibrium labor market model in which heterogeneous firms make dynamic employment decisions under labor search frictions. In the model, loadings on labor market tightness proxy for priced time-variation in the efficiency of the aggregate matching technology. Firms with low loadings are more exposed to adverse matching efficiency shocks and require higher expected stock returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12504","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance related to labor market frictions and equity returns, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2017","72","5","ROBERTO MARF\u00c8,\u00a0\n                     ROBERTO MARF\u00c8\n                     Roberto Marf\u00e8 is at Collegio Carlo Alberto.

Income insurance from shareholders to workers explains these term structures. Risk-sharing smooths wages but only concerns transitory risk and hence enhances short-run dividend risk. As a result, actual labor-share variation largely forecasts the risk, premium, and slope of dividend strips. A simple general equilibrium model in which labor rigidity affects dividend dynamics and the price of short-run risk reconciles standard asset pricing facts with the term structures of the equity premium, volatility, and macroeconomic variables, which are at odds in leading models.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12508","articles","JF","Finance","2","['income insurance', 'risk-sharing', 'labor-share']","The article discusses concepts like 'income insurance' and 'risk-sharing,' which touch on economic equity but do not emphasize social justice or progressive themes.

I model an originator who screens assets whose cash flows are later sold in secondary markets. Screening improves asset quality but gives rise to asymmetric information, hindering trade of the asset cash flows. In the optimal mechanism (second-best), costly retention of cash flows is essential to implement asset screening. Market allocations can feature too much or too little screening relative to second-best, where too much screening generates inefficiently illiquid markets. Furthermore, the economy is prone to multiple equilibria. The optimal mechanism is decentralized with two tools: retention rules and transfers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12519","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset screening and market liquidity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The key feature is that investors use different forecasting models, and hence assess uncertainty differently. As economic conditions deteriorate, uncertainty rises and investors' opinions polarize. Disagreement thus spikes in bad times, causing returns to react to past news. This phenomenon creates a positive relation between disagreement and future returns. It also generates time-series momentum, which strengthens in bad times, increases with disagreement, and crashes after sharp market rebounds.

In this paper, we show that much of the rise can be explained by a tendency of firms to grant the same number of options each year. Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion. We show that regulatory changes requiring transparent expensing of the grant-date value of options led to a decline in number-rigidity and helps explain why executive pay increased less with equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X16301477","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CEO compensation and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

First, it allows for an easy estimation of models that are more flexible than the AR(1). Indeed, we estimate models with more general dynamics, like ARFIMA(p, d, q), almost as easily as AR(1). Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative. Our results for the US Treasury bond market show that the unrestricted model is preferred to the AR(1) by the Bayesian Information Criterion, but the opposite conclusion is reached for more flexible models. A final advantage of the excess returns framework is that the pricing errors are much lower than for the equivalent log price system.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X17300922","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are essential for a higher woke score."],["2017","125","2","Author links open overlay panelRobert F.

In particular, EM-MNEs from less institutionally developed countries are likely to face liabilities of origin \u2013 negative perceptions in host countries about these firms\u2019 willingness and ability to conduct legitimate business. CSR reporting is an effective strategy to overcome such liabilities and barriers to legitimation as it conveys to host countries and global stakeholders alignment with global meta-norms and expectations.

At the country level, capital market development can lower the probability of M&A deal abandonment by facilitating the flow of information and capital. At the firm level, when acquirers are affiliated with business groups, development of internal capital markets can also lower this probability, facilitating completion of the transaction and the flow of information. This effect of business groups, however, decreases as the external capital market, the institution replaced by their internal markets, develops and its benefits become widely available to non-business groups.

We predict that foreign banks will be least hampered by information voids, due to their privileged access to private information about local conditions and ability to adapt quickly to new information. Portfolio investors, while impeded by information voids due to their severely limited access to local private information, are able to quickly respond to new information. Foreign direct investors have moderate access to local private information, yet their inability to adapt quickly creates problems dealing with information voids. Using time-series cross-sectional data on local public information and capital flows to the thirty largest emerging markets from 1994 to 2012, we find preliminary support for our hypotheses regarding the sensitivity of different investors to information voids.

Key to this argument is the fact that the performance of a firm in a particular host country can be importantly shaped not only by activities aimed at accessing key external resources in local markets, but also by those targeting resources in global markets. When the focus is tapping into local resource markets, foreignness can be a liability that grows in size with the idiosyncrasies of those markets. But when the same firm in the same host country turns to global markets for external resources, foreignness can become an asset that also increases in value with the significance of local idiosyncrasies. I test this argument by looking at the performance effect of being foreign for private equity (PE) firms when investing in, and when subsequently exiting from, portfolio companies in emerging economies. The analysis capitalizes on a novel dataset tracking 546 PE deals, managed by 45 foreign and local PE firms, and across 49 emerging economies at varying levels of institutional development.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-016-0032-1","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['foreignness', 'local markets', 'global markets', 'idiosyncrasies']","The article discusses the dual nature of foreignness in international business, touching on local market idiosyncrasies.

The present commentary highlights studies showing that foreign language use can also improve decision making and self-regulation. We propose that these benefits derive from two psychological factors. The first concerns the timing of cognitive depletion. Foreign language use involves an increase of memory load in the early phases of information processing, which has been shown to reduce the capture of attention by tempting stimuli. The second factor concerns the nature of human memory. Experiences and their associated emotions are coded in the language in which they occur, and thus are more accessible when the same language is used at retrieval. Therefore certain mental constructs, such as stereotypes, which have been shaped by years of cultural learning in a native language context, may exert less influence when processing a foreign language. The present treatment indicates value in extending Volk et al.\u2019s conceptual model, and can help develop language strategies that may ultimately improve organizational decision making.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-016-0040-1","commentary","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['decision making', 'cognitive resources', 'stereotypes']","The article discusses cognitive processes related to language use and decision making, touching on the influence of stereotypes, which hints at social implications.

In an empirical study, we directly compare firm-level growth option values across 34 countries and indeed find that economic uncertainty and various institutional measures for transactional uncertainty correlate in opposite directions with the value of growth opportunities.

The link between a country\u2019s institutions and firms\u2019 proportional growth options value is also moderated by firm size.

The results from a comprehensive panel of US multinationals suggest that home country expatriates can substitute for weak IP protection, but that this effect is contingent on the manufacturing and knowledge capabilities of foreign operations for higher value parent firm knowledge transfers.

We find that regulators initiate more enforcement actions, on average, against foreign banks than they do against domestic banks. The effects, however, vary by regulation type and firm characteristics. For example, foreign banks are no more likely to receive risk-related sanctions, but far more likely to receive stakeholder-related sanctions. Foreign banks with higher quality of human capital and more host country experience are less likely to run afoul of all regulations. Foreign banks with more third country experience are less likely to receive risk-related sanctions, but more likely to receive stakeholder-related sanctions.

We find that a strengthening of patent protection in the host country increases the incentive to license innovations to unaffiliated parties. While unaffiliated licensing rises among all firms, the volume of affiliated licensing falls among complex-technology firms but rises among simple-technology firms. The positive appropriability effect on affiliated licensing is strong enough among simple-technology firms that the entire composition of their licensing further shifts towards affiliated parties.

Applying institutional theorizing to improve our understanding of convergence/divergence as a process and an outcome, data collected from nine countries at three points in time over a decade confirm that convergence and divergence occur to different extents in a nonlinear fashion, and vary depending on the area of HRM practice observed. Patterns of adoption and convergence/divergence are explained through the effect of institutional constraints, which vary between liberal and coordinated market economies, and between indigenous firms and foreign MNE subsidiaries. Specifically, we expected, and largely found supporting evidence confirming that compensation and wage-bargaining level practices show more evidence of being institutionally constrained, and hence were less likely to converge, than contingent employment, training, and direct information provision practices. The study contributes a more graded conceptualization of convergence/divergence (from constant no difference, through robust convergence, non-robust convergence, non-robust divergence, and robust divergence to constant difference), allowing us to tease out the subtle manifestations of the process that can incorporate the complex dynamic reality of international business.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-017-0094-8","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['human resource management', 'institutional constraints', 'convergence', 'divergence']","The article discusses human resource management practices and their variations across different market economies, touching on institutional constraints.

We focus on the longitudinal dimension of internationalization, specifically path-breaking commitments that increase a firm\u2019s exposure to risk. On this basis, we examine the idea that the IP model represents an evolutionary process. By emphasizing the role of novelty and introducing selection mechanisms, we explain non-linear and discontinuous dynamics of internationalization processes. Path-breaking resource commitments create novelty and deviate from a gradual path of growth as firms take higher risks, and hence face more intensive selection pressures. In consequence, firms are more likely to experience outstanding performance \u2013 but are also more likely to experience failure.

Drawing on a multi-informant survey in a business-to-business context as well as on objective performance data, the authors find that segment differentiation tends to mitigate horizontal conflict and inhibit cooperation, while task differentiation reduces primarily vertical conflict and promotes cooperation. Moreover, depending on customer characteristics, segment differentiation may damage channel relationships overall and, in turn, limit company sales success, whereas task differentiation unambiguously promotes channel relationships and thus drives company sales success.

However, underdog positioning moderates this effect. When a moral service provider is positioned as an underdog, consumers feel empathy, thereby attenuating the dominance of competence.

Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees.

The authors test the hypotheses on a sample of 381 recall investigations in the automobile industry between 1999 and 2012. The results show that although problem severity increases time to recall, this relationship is weaker when the brand under investigation (1) has a strong reputation for reliability and (2) has experienced severe recalls in the recent past. However, the relationship between problem severity and time to recall is stronger when the brand is diverse. Importantly, the results reveal that stock markets punish recall delays.

Traditionally, demand for one format (e.g., concerts) would stimulate demand for the other format (e.g., recorded music) and vice versa, leading to an upward demand spiral. However, the market for recorded music is under pressure due to piracy and the unbundling of albums, which also entail threats for the traditional demand spiral. Despite the fundamental importance of recorded music and live concerts for the multibillion-dollar music industry, no prior research has studied their dynamic interplay. This study fills this void by developing new theory on how piracy, unbundling, artist fame, and music quality affect dynamic cross-format elasticities between record demand and concert demand. The theory is tested with a unique data set covering weekly concert and recorded music revenues for close to 400 artists across more than six years in the world's third-largest music market, Germany. The cross-format elasticity of record on concert revenue is much stronger than the reverse elasticity of concert on record revenue.

The authors use a unique data set collected during a CC implementation to empirically examine the impact of CC on the retailer, the captain, and the other manufacturers in the category. The authors find that both the retailer's private label and the captain benefit from CC because of pricing and assortment changes. They also find that some competing manufacturers benefit from CC while others suffer. Specifically, the manufacturers that closely compete with the captain benefit, whereas the manufacturers that are in close competition with the private label suffer because the retailer protects its private label.

Results validate the stability of the conceptualization across contexts.

By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence.

Furthermore, both voluntary recall initiation and postrecall remedial efforts positively moderate the impact of recall volume on long-term returns. These moderating effects are contrary to those in the short term. The results suggest that managers should use different advertising types during and after a recall, strategically initiate recalls, and diligently prepare postrecall remedies to mitigate the negative effects of recall volume on long-term return.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.15.0535","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['crisis management', 'product recalls', 'firm value']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of crisis management and firm value related to product recalls, with no emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

The authors examine the effects of emphases on two aspects of service satisfaction, relational service (interactions with the service provider's staff) and service environment (service provider's facilities), on the market shares of service and goods components of partnered hybrid offerings. Using multiple secondary data sources from the U.S. automobile industry between 2009 and 2015, the authors find that emphasizing relational service satisfaction increases service market share but decreases goods market share.

The goal of this research is therefore to provide nonprofits with tools to increase donations of used goods and provide a theoretical link between the literature streams on prosocial behavior, disposition, memory, and identity. As such, the authors explore the effectiveness of memory preservation strategies (e.g., taking a photo of a good before donating it) in increasing donations to nonprofits. A field study using a donation drive demonstrates that encouraging consumers to take photos of sentimental possessions before donating them increases donations, and five laboratory experiments explicate this result by mapping the proposed psychological process behind the success of memory preservation techniques.

Moreover, cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, social network use could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between social network use and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people's browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year.

However, managers may be overlooking the fact that complaints serve an equally important role in engendering loyalty. The authors demonstrate that the strength of social ties between customers and service providers influences the degree to which complaining drives loyalty. Paradoxically, while strongly tied customers fear that complaining threatens their ties with the provider, when they are encouraged to complain, their loyalty increases because offering feedback serves as an effective way to preserve social ties. Conversely, for weakly tied customers, complaining has no effect on loyalty. Furthermore, complaints are more effective in driving loyalty for strongly tied customers when the feedback is directed toward the provider who failed, rather than to an entity external to the failure. Finally, when providers signal an authentic openness to feedback, strongly tied customers are more loyal after complaining, whereas authenticity does little to engender loyalty for weakly tied customers who complain. The value of complaints in driving loyalty is promising both for customers who perceive a strong tie to a particular provider within the firm and, more generally, in service industries wherein strong ties naturally occur.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.16.0125","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['loyalty', 'social ties', 'feedback']","The article discusses the importance of social ties and customer feedback in service recovery, which touches on relational aspects of business but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy\u2014positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not. Managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context. However, given that consumers often experience brands in a social context, this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences. Specifically, the authors show that consumers\u2019 inferences of an anthropomorphized brand's intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal, thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand. The authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding (goal-related vs. goal-unrelated). In particular, a goal-related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions, which, in turn, leads to greater preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies. In contrast, the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal-unrelated crowded settings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.16.0211","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['engagement', 'social context', 'preferences']","The article primarily focuses on brand positioning strategies and consumer preferences without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources, thereby producing positive performance outcomes. However, building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory, the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm's bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value, which, in turn, hurts profits. Using a sample of 1,023 initial public offerings (IPOs) and robust econometric methods, they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts IPO outcomes, but significantly hurts balance sheet\u2013based outcomes (e.g., profitability). The results suggest that a 10% increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35% (or about $7 million) in the subsequent year, or 9.4% cumulatively over the next four years (or about $20.32 million).

Although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. The present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0364","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on financial returns from service amenities without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A database study and three lab experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers' desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to purchase fewer vices.

In the first module, the author identifies cycles by pattern-matching the amplitude and length of cycles observed to a user-specified definition. In the second module, the author defines the conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third, the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the different theories of fashion.

Empirical analyses of the large customer database of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash flow volatility and $39.42 million increase in the future cash flow level of the firm. Furthermore, firm-initiated marketing is 1.9\u20133.2 times more effective at managing the future cash flow level and volatility when it is selectively targeted to customers with certain characteristics.

And how may the effect of team composition on effort depend on the type of contest the teams are competing in? Using a game-theoretic model, we derive the very sharp predictions that when winning the contest depends on the average team sales, the ability composition of a team has no effect on team effort, and the stronger and weaker members will expend identical effort levels. However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort. Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average metric elicits the highest team effort. We also discuss cases when the minimum and maximum metrics are optimal. We test the model's empirical validity using two incentive-aligned experiments in which participants make effort decisions strategically.

Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content.

The authors demonstrate the efficiency advantages of the approach relative to design benchmarks and highlight practical implications using both simulated data and actual data from a conjoint choice experiment in which individual designs were customized instantaneously using self-stated active-inactive attribute status.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.13.0545","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of variable selection and choice processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0441","research article","JMR","Marketing","6","['environmental', 'conservation', 'green', 'commitment']","The article discusses the relationship between consumer behavior and firms' environmental efforts, emphasizing themes of sustainability and corporate responsibility.

Mortgage decisions are also prototypical of consumer financial choices that involve a stream of expenditures and consumption occurring across time. The authors use heterogeneity in time preferences for both immediate (present bias) and long-term outcomes to explain a sequence of mortgage decisions, including mortgage choice and the decision to abandon a mortgage. The authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households augmented by zip code\u2013level house price and foreclosure data. The model suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term patience increases mortgage abandonment. This reversal across mortgage decisions is difficult for alternative accounts to explain.

The authors offer a possible solution to this challenge: the emergency reserve, or slack with a cost. They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher attainability and value than other goals. Study 4 demonstrates that reserves can lead to increased goal persistence in a realistic task that involves persistence over time.

The authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted customers more valuable. These findings suggest that in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of the targeted customer but also the potential spillover of the campaign to nontargeted but connected customers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0442","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['social effects', 'network externalities', 'nontargeted customers']","The article discusses the social effects of CRM campaigns and their impact on nontargeted customers, indicating a consideration of broader societal implications.

Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This research has implications for sales force management because it helps managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent salesperson turnover.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0485","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['identity theory', 'social identity theory', 'peer effects']","The article discusses factors influencing salesperson turnover through identity theories, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong focus on DEI or ethical critiques.

Consequently, consumers frequently buy product upgrades that they would not have bought had they followed their own advice. Five experiments, involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading. The experiments suggest that this \u201ccomparison neglect\u201d increases upgrade likelihood by making people overlook the similarities between the upgraded and status quo options and that it persists even when deliberation effort is high.

These propositions are tested in several ways. First, when a beautiful recipient is included in basic choice sets, this recipient becomes the most popular option and increases donor satisfaction.

The PWE is a core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to overgeneralize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are more likely to use cost\u2013benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes.

This framework is used to assess how naturally occurring dietary variety relates to weight loss among overweight/obese women enrolled in a 16-week trial to achieve weight loss. Acknowledging this is a first exploratory attempt to test such relationships using correlational analyses, the authors uncover several key findings. First, whereas cumulative overall variety was not associated with weight loss, daily overall variety was positively associated with weight loss. Second, this relationship was strongest for variety during breakfast and afternoon snacks and was particularly driven by consuming greater vegetable variety.

This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices.

The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors\u2019 expectations of future firm performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0119","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investor behavior and stock market reactions to new product announcements without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

During the affectively charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect. In four field and laboratory studies, the authors establish this jilting effect, rule out alternative accounts, and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0373","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer preferences and psychological processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The evidence supports the coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in demand. In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store, that drives complementarity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0518","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of retail channel dynamics without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers\u2019 search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products, they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese TV market, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi-natural experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV channels\u2019 viewership, offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0121","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to commercial breaks and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The authors propose that consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the presence of appealing, though not yet attained, product upgrades (not just mere replacements). Carelessness and neglect toward currently owned products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades without appearing wasteful. A series of studies with actual owners of a wide range of different goods (durable, consumable, functional, and hedonic products) and evidence from a real-word data set of lost Apple iPhones demonstrate how the availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that product neglect in the presence of attractive upgrades can occur without deliberate intentions.

The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8%\u201310% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms\u2014enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0204","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['sharing economy', 'impact', 'peer-to-peer']","The article primarily focuses on the economic impact of the sharing economy on traditional hotel industries without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

This research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus, consumers resist altering the \u201cwhole\u201d of the bundle by removing or adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis)satisfaction (Study 3). Moreover, bundle composition\u2014the ability of different items to create the impression of a \u201cwhole\u201d\u2014moderates the effect of bundling on valuation (Study 4), and the need to replace missing items (i.e., restoring the \u201cwhole\u201d) mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study 6).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0277","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of bundling and its impact on consumer valuation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0443","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['stakeholders', 'data-driven', 'guidelines']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of decision support systems for marketing without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The authors apply their method to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies. The results from the data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various unique insights compared with using revealed data only. The authors find that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well, leading to substantial profit increases for each firm. With respect to sales force allocation, when competitors decrease their sales force, they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors, rather than decreasing the number of details to the most-visited doctors. The proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool to, ex ante, predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy changes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0498","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for predicting marketing outcomes based on consumer demand and competitive reactions, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors link specific brand image attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired worldwide.

Dynamic programming decomposition is considered one of the strongest heuristics and is the method chosen in some recent commercial implementations, and remains a topic of research in the recent academic literature. In addition to a plain-vanilla implementation of dynamic programming decomposition, we consider two variants proposed in recent literature.

We generate many alternative problem scenarios by varying capacity-demand ratio and network structure and show that the performance of the different heuristics can be strongly influenced by both.

We consider two types of quality consistency constraint. In the first, there is an inherent ordering between the qualities of the products in a particular nest and the price for a product of a higher quality should be larger. In the second type of constraint, different nests correspond to different quality levels; the price for any product in a nest corresponding to a higher quality level should be larger than the price for any product in a nest corresponding to a lower quality level. Prices for the products are chosen from a finite set of possible prices. We develop algorithms to find the prices to charge for the products to maximize the expected revenue obtained from a customer, while adhering to a quality consistency constraint. Our algorithms are based on solving linear programs whose sizes scale polynomially with the number of nests, number of products, and number of possible prices for the products. We also give extensions to the cases beyond the two types of quality consistency constraints. Numerical experiments indicate that our algorithms can effectively compute the optimal prices even when there is a large number of products in consideration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0714","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical pricing problems and algorithms without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity, resulting in a score of 1."],["2017","29","1","Kuo-Ling Huang\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Kuo-Ling Huangjupiters1117@northwestern.eduDepartment of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208Search for more papers by this author, Sanjay MehrotraSanjay Mehrotramehrotra@iems.northwestern.eduDepartment of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208Search for more papers by this author","Solution of Monotone Complementarity and General Convex Programming Problems Using a Modified Potential Reduction Interior Point Method","We present a homogeneous algorithm equipped with a modified potential function for the monotone complementarity problem.

A practical algorithm based on this potential function is implemented in a software package named iOptimize. The implementation in iOptimize maintains global linear and polynomial time convergence properties, while achieving practical performance. It either successfully solves the problem, or concludes that the SLC is not satisfied. When compared with the mature software package MOSEK (barrier solver version 6.0.0.106), iOptimize solves convex quadratic programming problems, convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problems, and general convex programming problems in fewer iterations. Moreover, several problems for which MOSEK fails are solved to optimality.

Treating the nonconvex cross-product terms is the key. State-of-the-art methods usually convert such a problem into a 0-1 mixed-integer linear programming problem and then adopt the branch-and-bound scheme to find an optimal solution. Much effort has been spent on reducing the required numbers of variables and linear constraints as well as on avoiding unbalanced branch-and-bound trees. This study presents a set of equations that linearize the discrete cross-product terms in an extremely effective manner. It is shown that embedding the proposed \u201cequations for linearizing discrete products\u201d into those state-of-the-art methods in the literature not only significantly reduces the required number of linear constraints from O(h3n3) to O(hn) for a cubic polynomial discrete program with n variables in h possible values but also tighten these methods with much more balanced branch-and-bound trees.

We compare the effect of using cuts in two ways: (i) cut-and-project, where integrality constraints are used to derive cuts in the extended variable space, and Benders cuts are then used to project the resulting improved relaxation, and (ii) project-and-cut, where integrality constraints are used to derive cuts directly in the Benders reformulation. For the case of split cuts, we demonstrate that although these approaches yield equivalent relaxations when considering a single split disjunction, cut-and-project yields stronger relaxations in general when using multiple split disjunctions. Computational results illustrate that the difference can be very large, and demonstrate that using split cuts within the cut-and-project framework can significantly improve the performance of Benders decomposition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0717","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic integer programming and optimization techniques without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The aggregation relies on a correlation between the resource consumption of the elements and the corresponding optimal dual values. The resulting aggregated dual model is a restriction of the original one, and it can be rapidly optimized to obtain a feasible dual solution. A primal bound can also be obtained by restricting the set of columns to those saturated by the dual feasible solution obtained by aggregation. The convergence is realized by iterative disaggregation until the gap is closed by the bounds. Computational results show the usefulness of our method for different cutting-stock problems. An important advantage is the fact that it can produce high-quality dual bounds much faster than the traditional Lagrangian bound used in stabilized column generation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0718","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization in column generation models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, these songs are often found well before the official release date on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Not surprisingly, the industry considers this so-called \u201cprerelease\u201d piracy to be extremely damaging to the potential sales of a song. In this paper, we analyze the effect of antipiracy measures on the propagation of unauthorized content in P2P networks. For this purpose, we develop a model that describes the dynamics of demand and supply of piracy from the early stages. Using a unique data set, we quantify the impact of antipiracy measures; specifically, we analyze two antipiracy measures: the reduction of file supply and the reduction of file demand. We find that the impact of a demand reduction on demand is greater than the impact of a supply reduction on supply. From a policy point of view, our results suggest that taking antipiracy measures early on is important. In addition, and potentially more controversial, our results provide support for the notion that to reduce piracy, punishing end users is as effective as controlling the supply of unauthorized music files.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0719","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of antipiracy measures and their effects on P2P networks without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In these problems the defender first selects a subset of assets to protect, the attacker next damages a subset of unprotected assets in the \u201cinterdiction\u201d stage, after which the defender optimizes a \u201crecourse\u201d problem over the surviving assets. These problems are notoriously difficult to optimize, and almost always require the recourse problem to be a convex optimization problem. Our contribution is a new approach to solving defender-attacker-defender problems. We require all variables in the first two stages to be binary-valued, but allow the recourse problem to take any form. The proposed framework focuses on solving the interdiction problem by restricting the defender to select a recourse decision from a sample of feasible vectors. The algorithm then iteratively refines the sample to force finite convergence to an optimal solution. We demonstrate that our algorithm not only solves interdiction problems involving NP-hard recourse problems within reasonable computational limits, but it also solves shortest path fortification and interdiction problems more efficiently than state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for that problem, finding optimal solutions to real-road networks having up to 300,000 nodes and over 1,000,000 arcs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0721","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization problems related to defender-attacker scenarios without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We pose the problem in a slightly more general form by allowing service zones to be rectangular instead of squares, thereby addressing applications in camera view-frame selection as well. More specifically, our problem, referred to as PMCLP-PCR (planar MCLP with partial coverage and rectangular demand and service zones), is to position a given number of rectangular service zones (SZs) on the two-dimensional plane to (partially) cover a set of existing (possibly overlapping) rectangular demand zones (DZs) such that the total covered demand is maximized. Previous studies on (planar) MCLP have assumed binary coverage, even when nonpoint objects such as lines or polygons have been used to represent demand. Under the binary coverage assumption, the problem can be readily formulated and solved as a binary linear program; whereas, partial coverage, although much more realistic, cannot be efficiently handled by binary linear programming, making PMCLP-PCR much more challenging to solve. In this paper, we first prove that PMCLP-PCR is NP-hard if the number of SZs is part of the input. We then present an improved algorithm for the single-SZ PMCLP-PCR, which is at least two times faster than the existing exact plateau vertex traversal algorithm. Next, we study multi-SZ PMCLP-PCR for the first time and prove theoretical properties that significantly reduce the search space for solving this problem, and we present a customized branch-and-bound exact algorithm to solve it. Our computational experiments show that this algorithm can solve relatively large instances of multi-SZ PMCLP-PCR in a short time. We also propose a fast polynomial time heuristic algorithm. Having optimal solutions from our exact algorithm, we benchmark the quality of solutions obtained from our heuristic algorithm. Our results show that for all the random instances solved to optimality by our exact algorithm, our heuristic algorithm finds a solution in a fraction of a second, where its objective value is at least 91% of the optimal objective in 90% of the instances (and at least 69% of the optimal objective in all the instances).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0722","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in operations research related to coverage location without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although worst-case error bounds are available for these approximations, their actual performance has not yet been investigated, mainly because this requires solving the original recourse model. In this paper we assess the quality of the approximating solutions using Monte Carlo sampling, or more specifically, using the so-called multiple replications procedure. Based on numerical experiments for an integer newsvendor problem, a fleet allocation and routing problem, and a stochastic activity network investment problem, we conclude that the error bounds are reasonably sharp if the variability of the random parameters in the model is either small or large; otherwise, the actual error of using the convex approximations is much smaller than the error bounds suggest. Moreover, we conclude that the solutions obtained using the convex approximations are good only if the variability of the random parameters is medium to large. In case this variability is small, however, typically sampling methods perform best, even with modest sample sizes. In this sense, the convex approximations and sampling methods can be considered as complementary solution methods. Moreover, as required for our applications, we extend our approach to derive new error bounds dealing with deterministic second-stage side constraints and relatively complete recourse, and perfect dependencies in the right-hand side vector.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0725","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of convex approximations in mathematical modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If an order is completed but not immediately delivered by a transporter, the order is kept temporarily in inventory, which incurs an inventory cost. There is a delivery cost for delivering an order, which varies with the departure time. Given a set of orders, the objective is to find an integrated schedule for processing the orders, keeping finished orders in inventory if necessary, and delivering them to the customers such that the total inventory and delivery cost is minimum. We consider two classes of problems: where order delivery is splittable and where order delivery is nonsplittable.

Unfortunately, an exact solution for a Markovian fork/join network can only be obtained by analyzing the underlying Markov chain using numerical methods, and these methods are computationally feasible only for networks with small population sizes and numbers of service stations. In this paper we present a new, simple, and accurate analytical approximation method to estimate the throughput (and other performance metrics) of a closed queueing network that features a single fork/join station receiving inputs from general subnetworks. An extensive numerical study illustrates the high accuracy of our proposed technique, especially for networks with large populations and numbers of stations. It also shows that the accuracy of our approximation method improves with increasing population size, deteriorating network balance, and increasing number of stations when the added stations weaken the network balance. Furthermore, our method has significant computational advantages compared to simulation and existing approximation techniques, the latter of which are in general less accurate than ours and in many cases even fail to provide a solution in our numerical study. We also bound analytically the relative error of our method for a broad class of networks, which provides theoretical support for some of our numerical observations.

The results show that CT and ST consistently rank first and second, respectively, in maximizing the recommendation accuracy, and VCT and VST always lead to the lowest and second lowest misclassification cost. Therefore, CT and VCT should be the methods of choice in dealing with users\u2019 lying behaviors. Furthermore, we find that KM is outperformed by not only the four proposed methods, but sometimes even by the TT method. This result further confirms the advantage necessity of differentiating liars from truth-tellers when both types of users exist in the population.

MIQCR is a method for solving mixed-integer quadratic programs and works in two phases: the first phase determines an equivalent quadratic formulation with a convex objective function by solving a semidefinite problem (SDP); in the second phase, the equivalent formulation is solved by a standard solver. Because the reformulation relies on the solution of a large-scale semidefinite program, it is not tractable by existing semidefinite solvers even for medium-sized problems. To surmount this difficulty, we present in MIQCR-CB a subgradient algorithm within a Lagrangian duality framework for solving (SDP) that substantially speeds up the first phase. Moreover, this algorithm leads to a reformulated problem of smaller size than the one obtained by the original MIQCR method, which results in a shorter time for solving the second phase. We present extensive computational results to show the efficiency of our algorithm. First, we apply MIQCR-CB to the k-cluster problem that can be formulated by a binary quadratic program. As an illustration of the efficiency of our new algorithm, for instances of size 80 and of density 25%, MIQCR-CB is on average 78 times faster for phase 1 and 24 times faster for phase 2 than the original MIQCR. We also compare MIQCR-CB with QCR and with BiqCrunch, two methods devoted to binary quadratic programming. We show that MIQCR-CB is able to solve most of the 225 considered instances within three hours of CPU time. We also present experiments on two classes of general integer instances where we compare MIQCR-CB with MIQCR, Couenne, and Cplex12.6.

The classical robust counterpart of a problem requires the solution to be feasible for all uncertain parameter values in a so-called uncertainty set and offers no guarantees for parameter values outside this uncertainty set. The globalized robust counterpart (GRC) extends this idea by allowing controlled constraint violations in a larger uncertainty set. The constraint violations are controlled by the distance of the parameter from the original uncertainty set. We derive tractable GRCs that extend the initial GRCs in the literature: our GRC is applicable to nonlinear constraints instead of only linear or conic constraints, and the GRC is more flexible with respect to both the uncertainty set and distance measure function, which are used to control the constraint violations.

One notable example is obtaining informative customer feedback (e.g., customer-product ratings via costly incentives) to improve the effectiveness of recommender systems. In this paper, we develop a novel active learning approach, which aims to intelligently select informative training instances to be labeled so as to maximally improve the prediction accuracy of a real-valued prediction model. We focus on large, heterogeneous, and dyadic data, and on localized modeling techniques, which have been shown to model such data particularly well, as compared to a single, \u201cglobal\u201d model. Importantly, dyadic data with covariates is pervasive in contemporary big data applications such as large-scale recommender systems and search advertising. A key benefit from incorporating dyadic information is their simple, meaningful representation of heterogeneous data, in contrast to alternative local modeling techniques that typically produce complex and incomprehensible predictive patterns. We develop a computationally efficient active learning policy specifically tailored to exploit multiple local prediction models to identify informative acquisitions. Existing active learning policies are often computationally prohibitive for the setting we explore, and our policy makes the application of active learning computationally feasible for this setting. We present comprehensive empirical evaluations that demonstrate the benefits of our approach and explore its performance in real world, challenging domains.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0732","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of active learning and predictive modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem embeds a complex cost structure and generalizes several existing facility location problems, such as those that allow temporary facility closing or capacity expansion and reduction. As the model may become very large, general-purpose mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers are limited to solving instances of small to medium size. In this paper, we extend the generalized model to the case of multiple commodities. We propose Lagrangian heuristics, based on subgradient and bundle methods, to find good quality solutions for large-scale instances with up to 250 facility locations and 1,000 customers. To improve the final solution quality, a restricted MIP model is solved based on the information collected through the solution of the Lagrangian dual. Computational results show that the Lagrangian-based heuristics provide highly reliable results for all problem variants considered. They produce good quality solutions in short computing times even for instances where state-of-the-art MIP solvers do not find feasible solutions.

Our objective is to choose a fluence map and a number of fractions to maximize the biological effect of tumor dose averaged over its voxels subject to maximum dose, mean dose, and dose-volume constraints for various normal tissues. Constraints are expressed in biologically effective dose equivalents. We propose an efficient convex programming method to approximately solve the resulting computationally difficult model. Through extensive computer simulations on 10 head-and-neck and prostate cancer test cases with a broad range of radiobiological parameters, we compare the biological effect on tumors obtained by our integrated approach relative to that from two other models. The first is a traditional intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence map optimization model that does not optimize the number of fractions. The second assumes that a fluence map is available a priori from a traditional IMRT optimization model and then optimizes the number of fractions, thus separating the spatial and temporal components. The improvements in tumor biological effect over IMRT were 9%\u201352%, with an average of 22% for head-and-neck, and 53%\u2013108%, with an average of 69% for prostate. The improvements in tumor biological effect over the spatiotemporally separated model were 15%\u201345%, with an average of 27%, and 17%\u201323%, with an average of 21%, for head-and-neck and prostate, respectively.

However, recently diversity of recommendations has also become an important aspect in evaluating recommender systems. One dimension of diversity is called aggregate diversity, which refers to the diversity of items in the recommendation lists of all users and can be defined with different metrics. The maximization of both accuracy and the aggregate diversity simultaneously renders a multiobjective optimization problem that can be handled by different approaches. In this paper, after providing a thorough analysis of the multiobjective optimization approaches for this problem, we propose a new model that takes into account both accuracy and aggregate diversity. Different from previous works, our model is specifically designed to incorporate distributional diversity metrics, which measure how evenly the items are distributed in the recommendation lists of users. To solve the large-scale instances, we propose a column generation algorithm and a Lagrangian relaxation approach based on the decomposition of the model. We present the results of the mathematical models and the performance of the proposed methodology that are obtained by computational experiments on real-world data sets.

Our results show that when heuristics are used to build the support graph and the support graph has branchwidth at most 7, our algorithm is able to provide a solution of lower cost than any of the heuristic solutions. When linear programming is used to build the support graph and the support graph has branchwidth at most 7, then our algorithm provides better solutions than popular heuristics and is faster than integer programming.

We extend the OR planning and scheduling problem from a single independent hospital to a coalition of multiple hospitals in a strategic network, where a pool of patients, surgeons, and ORs are collaboratively planned. To solve the resulting mixed-integer dual resource constrained model, we develop a novel logic-based Benders\u2019 decomposition approach that employs an allocation master problem, sequencing sub-problems for each hospital-day, and novel multistrategy Benders\u2019 feasibility and optimality cuts. We investigate various patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibilities, as well as the impact of surgeon schedule tightness. Using real data obtained from the General Surgery Departments of the University Health Network (UHN) hospitals, consisting of Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Princess Margret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (who already engage in some collaborative resource sharing), we find that on average, collaborative OR scheduling with traditional patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility results in 6% cost-savings, while flexible patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility increases cost-savings to 40%, and surgeon schedule tightness can impact costs by 15%. The collective impact of our collaboration and patient flexibility results in between 45% and 63% savings per surgery.

The quality of the solution is a major determinant of cost performance in related production and inventory management systems, and therefore there is intense pressure to develop effective practical solutions. In the literature, a number of heuristics have been proposed for solving the problem. However, the heuristics are limited in obtaining high solution qualities. This paper proposes a new progressive selection algorithm that hybridizes heuristic search and extended reformulation into a single framework. The method has the advantage of generating a strong bound using the extended reformulation, which can provide good guidelines on partitioning and sampling in the heuristic search procedure to ensure an efficient solution process. We also analyze per-item and per-period Dantzig\u2013Wolfe decompositions of the problem and present theoretical comparisons. The master problem of the per period Dantzig\u2013Wolfe decomposition is often degenerate, which results in a tailing-off effect for column generation.

Nodes of the branch-and-bound tree are pruned whenever the corresponding subproblem is proven not to contain a solution better than the best solution found so far. This is a key ingredient for achieving reasonable solution times. However, since subproblems are solved in floating-point arithmetic, numerical errors can occur and may lead to inappropriate pruning. As a consequence, optimal solutions may be cut off. We propose several methods for avoiding this issue, in the special case of a branch-cut-and-price formulation for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The methods are based on constructing dual feasible solutions for the linear programming relaxations of the subproblems and obtaining, by weak duality, bounds on their objective function value. Such approaches have been proposed before for formulations with a small number of variables (dual constraints), but the problem becomes more complex when the number of variables is exponentially large, which is the case in consideration. We show that, in practice, along with being safe, our bounds are stronger than those usually employed, obtained with unsafe floating-point arithmetic plus some heuristic tolerance, and all of this at a negligible computational cost. We also discuss some potential advantages and other uses of our safe bounds derivation.

The computational expense arising from the objective function evaluations considerably restricts the number of evaluations that can be done to find Pareto-optimal solutions. Frequently used multiobjective optimization methods are based on evolutionary strategies and generally require a prohibitively large number of function evaluations to find a good approximation of the Pareto front. SOCEMO, in contrast, employs surrogate models to approximate the expensive objective functions. These surrogate models are used in the iterative sampling process to decide at which points in the variable domain the next expensive evaluations should be done. Therefore, fewer expensive objective function evaluations are needed, and a good approximation of the Pareto front can be found efficiently. Previous algorithms have generally been tested on problems with few variables (up to 10) and few objective functions (up to 5). In our numerical study, we show that our algorithm performs well for benchmark problems with up to 35 dimensions and up to 10 objective functions, as well as two engineering application problems. We compared the performance of SOCEMO to a variant of NSGA-II and show that SOCEMO\u2019s sophisticated search strategy is more efficient than NSGA-II when the number of allowable function evaluations is low.

The objective is to minimize the combined costs of opening procedure rooms and utilizing overtime to complete a day\u2019s procedures. The dynamic patient-allocation decisions are made in an uncertain environment where the number of patients scheduled and the procedure durations are not known in advance. The resulting optimization model\u2019s tractability focuses the paper\u2019s attention on approximation methods and a special case that is amenable to decomposition-based solution methods.

This is a discrete facility location problem with stochastic demands that can be formulated as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse. In particular, facility locations and customer assignments must be decided here and now, i.e., before knowing the customers who will actually require to be served. In a second stage, service decisions are made according to the actual requests. The heuristic proposed consists of a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure followed by a path relinking. The heterogeneous Bernoulli demands make prohibitive the computational effort for evaluating feasible solutions. Thus the expected cost of a feasible solution is simulated when necessary. The results of extensive computational tests performed for evaluating the quality of the heuristic are reported, showing that high-quality feasible solutions can be obtained for the problem in fairly small computational times.

Associated with each customer order is a release date that defines the earliest time that the order is available to leave the depot for delivery and a due date that indicates the time by which the order should ideally be delivered to the customer. The objective is to minimize a convex combination of the operational costs and customer service level, represented by the total distance traveled and the total weighted tardiness of delivery, respectively. A path-relinking algorithm (PRA) is proposed to address the problem, and a variety of benchmark instances are generated to evaluate its performance. The PRA exploits the efficiency and aggressive improvement of neighborhood search but relies on a new path-relinking procedure and advanced population management strategies to navigate the search space effectively. To provide a comparator algorithm to the PRA, we embed the neighborhood search into a standard iterated local search algorithm (ILS). Extensive computational experiments on the benchmark instances show that the newly defined features have a significant and varied impact on the problem, and the performance of the PRA dominates that of the ILS algorithm.

Our methodology consists of two steps. The first step uses phase-type distributions to approximate the general interarrival and service times, thus generating an approximating Pht/Pht/nt queue. The second step develops strong approximation theory to approximate the Pht/Pht/nt queue with fluid and diffusion limits whose mean and variance can be computed using ordinary differential equations. However, by naively representing the Pht/Pht/nt queue as a Markov process by expanding the state space, we encounter the lingering phenomenoneven when the queue is overloaded. Lingering typically occurs when the mean queue length is equal or near the number of servers, however, in this case it also happens when the queue is overloaded and this time is not of zero measure. As a result, we develop an alternative representation for the queue length process that avoids the lingering problem in the overloaded case, thus allowing for the derivation of a Gaussian diffusion limit. Finally, we compare the effectiveness of our proposed method with discrete event simulation in a variety parameter settings and show that our approximations are very accurate.

Identification of irreducible infeasible sets (IISs) can facilitate the process of correcting infeasible models. Several filtering algorithms have been proposed for IIS identification but efficient implementations are available only for linear programs. We propose a novel approach for IIS identification that is applicable to linear programs (LPs), nonlinear programs (NLPs), mixed-integer linear programs (MIPs), and mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). The approach makes use of a deletion presolve procedure that exploits bounds tightening techniques to reduce the model to an infeasible set (IS) in a computationally efficient manner. The IS is subsequently reduced to an IIS by applying one of the currently available exact filtering algorithms for IIS identification. We implement the proposed deletion presolve along with four filtering algorithms for IIS identification within the global solver BARON. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through computational experiments on a test set of 790 infeasible LPs, NLPs, MIPs, and MINLPs. Deletion presolve rapidly eliminates a large fraction of the problem constraints and speeds up the filtering algorithms by over forty times on average. Speedups of as high as 1,000 times are observed for some problems, while, for 40% of the test problems, the deletion presolve itself reduces the original model to an IIS.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0761","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization algorithms without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

This paper argues that contemporary manufacturing in high-cost economies is rooted in technological innovation. As such, it can be enhanced by industrial policy interventions that prevent systems failures in the process of turning technological innovation into commercially viable products. In particular, we argue that this can be achieved by establishing non-firm, intermediate research organizations and by other measures to change the institutional architecture of an economy. We disagree with claims in earlier OM literature that industrial policy is all but irrelevant to manufacturing firms and to OM. Instead, we argue that OM must broaden its conceptual scope so as to encompass active engagement with non-firm network participants such as government-supported intermediate research organizations, and that, as well as learning to be effective users of industrial policy, OM practitioners and academics should engage actively in the development of industrial policy. In this way, high-value, high-productivity manufacturing can be viable in high-cost economic environments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.12.003","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['industrial policy', 'economic activity', 'technological innovation']","The article discusses the role of industrial policy in operations management, highlighting the importance of government interventions and collaboration with non-firm entities.

Time-insensitive products considered in isolation seldom justify a cost premium, leading many decision makers to conclude that their production does not belong in a high-cost environment. This leads to a manufacturing-location decision in which profitable and time-sensitive products are produced in a high-cost environment and time-insensitive products are transferred to a low-cost environment. Responsiveness, however, requires a capacity buffer that provides the option to meet a demand peak for a profitable, time-sensitive product. Leftover capacity can then be ideally deployed to manufacture time-insensitive products to stock. We propose that the cost of the capacity buffer be considered as an option cost and assigned to the time-sensitive product: \u201coption-based costing\u201d. We then demonstrate use of demand volatility to create a portfolio of products that are time sensitive and insensitive to generate profit and increase competitiveness.

To examine this assumption, we provide evidence from the collapse of the Rana Plaza building on April 24, 2013, which with its 1133 fatalities and 2438 injuries is seen as one of the worst industrial accidents in history. Do markets reactive negatively enough to such events to motivate firms to shift their sourcing strategy? We analyze the stock market reaction to the Rana Plaza disaster in the Bangladeshi ready-made garment industry to address this question. Our analysis is based on a sample of 39 publicly traded global apparel retailers with significant garment sourcing in Bangladesh. Stock market reaction to retailers on the day of the Rana Plaza disaster is negative, but its magnitude and significance dissipate by the following day. We find no evidence of significant stock market reaction during the 11 trading days (approximately two weeks in calendar time) following the disaster. Retailers responded to the disaster by developing two different agreements to improve factory and worker safety in Bangladesh \u2013 the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (AFBSB), and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (ABWS). We find no evidence of significant stock market reaction to the announcements of the AFBSB and the ABWS. The insignificant negative economic impact from the Rana Plaza disaster suggests that retailers have little economic incentive to move sourcing out of Bangladesh or other low-cost countries so as to reduce the risk of being involved in such events.

However, the electronics industry provides an exception to this trend, where dynamic, high cost conditions have given rise to a new production system \u2013 seru \u2013 a cellular assembly approach. Seru evolved as an alternative to lean systems approaches, manifesting important differentiated system design choices that appear to offer promise for manufacturing in dynamic, high-cost markets. This paper reports the results of in-depth, longitudinal case studies of two electronics giants who have implemented seru. The case studies describe seru's fundamental extensions to, and departures from, lean production, agile production, and group technology-based cellular manufacturing. We explain how Sony and Canon have applied seru to improve productivity, quality, and flexibility in ways that have enabled them to remain competitive. In addition, our findings elaborate the theory of swift, even flow, with implications for future research of trade-offs related to production efficiency, responsiveness, and competitiveness in high-cost, technologically dynamic markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.01.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of manufacturing and competitiveness without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Recent research suggests that the right level of operational slack, typically in the form of inventory, is very little but not none. However, this conclusion was reached without considering the role of slack resources in occupational safety, which is a critical oversight since the safety literature predicts that the reduction of operational slack harms workers. To address this gap, secondary data from 3945 publically listed U.S. firms is used to explore the role of operational and financial slack as well as market factors in occupational safety. The results show that decreasing operational slack harms workers and that this effect is mitigated when firms hold higher levels of financial slack.

Whereas the extant literature has focused primarily on the statistical aspect of the problem, a comprehensive treatment requires an examination of theoretical and pragmatic considerations as complements. The prevailing problem with the focus on statistical techniques is that the standards tend to be derived from idealizations: the correlation between a regressor and a disturbance term must be exactly zero, or the analysis will be invalid. In actual empirical research settings, such a knife-edge assumption can never be satisfied, indeed it cannot even be directly tested. Idealizations are useful in helping us understand what it would take to eliminate endogeneity, but when applied directly and unconditionally, they lead to unreasonable standards that may unnecessarily stifle substantive inquiry.

These prima facie attention checks range from the simple such as reverse scaling first proposed a century ago to more recent and involved methods such as evaluating response patterns and timed responses via online data capture tools. The attention check validations also range from easily implemented mechanisms such as automatic detection through directed queries to highly intensive investigation of responses by the researcher. The latter has the potential to introduce inadvertent researcher bias as the researcher's judgment may impact the interpretation of the data. The empirical findings of the present work reveal that construct and scale validations show consistently significant improvement in the fit statistics\u2014a finding of great use for researchers working predominantly with scales and constructs for their empirical models. However, based on the rudimentary experimental models employed in the analysis, attention checks generally do not show a consistent, systematic improvement in the significance of test statistics for experimental manipulations. This latter result indicates that, by their very nature, attention checks may trigger an inherent trade-off between loss of sample subjects\u2014lowered power and increased Type II error\u2014and the potential of capitalizing on chance alone\u2014the possibility that the previously significant results were in fact the result of Type I error. The analysis also shows that the attrition rates due to attention checks\u2014upwards of 70% in some observed samples\u2014are far larger than typically assumed. Such loss rates raise the specter that studies not validating attention may inadvertently increase their Type I error rate. The manuscript provides general guidelines for various attention checks, discusses the psychological nuances of the methods, and highlights the delicate balance among incentive alignment, monetary compensation, and the subsequently triggered mood of respondents.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.06.001","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data quality and attention checks without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Evidence from eBay","Consumer return rates have been steadily rising in recent years, resulting in growing costs for retailers who must manage the returns process and the disposition of returned products. This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers \u2013 that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population.

Prior studies on supply chain structure have largely emphasized network-level attributes but ignored supply-base level characteristics. However, in many cases it is the 1st tier suppliers, not those \u201cdeep in the network,\u201d that have most immediate influence on the buyer. In addition, some structural characteristics, such as direct links between the buyer's suppliers and its customers, are not-so-visible to the buyer, yet can impact its financial performance dramatically. The existing literature has overlooked these not-so-visible structural links. Using objective supply chain data collected from Mergent Online and Compustat, we map the supply base structure of 867 public firms. We construct three visible (horizontal, vertical and spatial) and two not-so-visible (eliminative and cooperative) structural complexity metrics, and examine their impacts on buyer firms' financial performance as measured by Return on Assets and Tobin's Q. Our empirical analysis shows that the five dimensions have differential effects: some have negligible impacts while others appear to strongly affect financial performance. Contrary to the common belief that complexity hurts performance, we find that an individual complexity dimension may have both positive and negative effects, and the overall effect may be non-linear.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.10.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of supply chain complexity and its impact on financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our proposed solution emerges as a synthesis of applying Goldratt's Theory of Constraints and the principles of variable-demand inventory replenishment. The improved system exhibits both more level resource utilization and higher productivity due to more efficient capacity utilization. In addition to improving system efficiency, we gain insights into how authentic operations management problems can be addressed through design research. A crucial aspect of empirically-rooted practical problems is that they always involve multiple stakeholders with only partially overlapping preferences. Consequently, one must not assume or ascribe an a priori system objective, instead, it must arise from explicit empirical analysis of the relevant stakeholders. Another characteristic of authentic problems is that they are always embedded in an institutional context that sets significant boundary conditions to the feasibility of solutions.

We adopt a configural approach to develop a theoretical model of expertise coordination that differentiates between design collaboration and technical collaboration.  We propose that neither a strictly centralized, top-down model nor a largely decentralized approach is superior.  Our model is tested in a field study of 71 software development teams.  We conclude that because design work addresses ill-structured problems with diverse potential solutions, decentralization of design collaboration can lead to greater coordination success and reduced team conflict.  Conversely, technical work benefits from centralized collaboration.  We find that task knowledge tacitness strengthens these relationships between collaboration configuration and coordination outcomes and that team conflict mediates the relationships.  Our findings underline the need to differentiate between technical and design collaboration and point to the importance of certain configurations in reducing team conflict and increasing coordination success in software development teams.

We conduct an in-depth content analysis of 171 real SDO contracts and empirically examine how project attributes and contract parties\u2019 bargaining power affect the allocation of intellectual property rights (IPR).  We find that clients retained more IPR when software development was modularized whereas they shared more IPR with vendors in contracts that incorporated greater use of a vendor\u2019s proprietary software.  Greater levels of task complexity were associated with more IPR sharing with vendors.  We also find that the responsiveness of IPR to project attributes varied across the different types of intellectual assets.  For example, vendors were more likely to obtain redeployment rights of know-how if they were contracted for novel software development projects.  However, clients were less likely to cede ownership of data and confidential information embedded in software customization projects.

The ability to easily assess users\u2019 emotion during live system use therefore has practical significance for the design and improvement of information systems.  In this paper, we discuss using human\u2013computer interaction input devices to infer emotion.  Specifically, we utilize attentional control theory to explain how movement captured via a computer mouse (i.e., mouse-cursor movements) can be a real-time indicator of negative emotion.  We report three studies.  In Study 1, an experiment with 65 participants from Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants\u2019 mouse cursor movements as they completed a number-ordering task.  We found that negative emotion increases the distance and reduces the speed of mouse cursor movements during the task.  In Study 2, an experiment with 126 participants from a U.S. university, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants\u2019 mouse cursor movements while they interacted with a mock e-commerce site.  We found that mouse cursor distance and speed can be used to infer the presence of negative emotion with an overall accuracy rate of 81.7 percent.  In Study 3, an observational study with 80 participants from universities in Germany and Hong Kong, we monitored mouse cursor movements while participants interacted with an online product configurator.  Participants reported their level of emotion after each step in the configuration process.  We found that mouse cursor distance and speed can be used to infer the level of negative emotion with an out-out-of-sample R2 of 0.17.

Policies such as opt-out or opt-in that provide consumers the option to voluntarily participate in profiling are the favored compromise.  We compare voluntary profiling to no profiling and show that voluntary profiling leads to some counterintuitive results.  Consumers that do not participate in profiling and some that participate are worse off under voluntary profiling.  Neither social welfare nor aggregate consumer surplus is necessarily higher under voluntary profiling; even when voluntary profiling leads to an increase in social welfare, it may come at the expense of consumer surplus.  If the seller cannot price discriminate and charge only a uniform price for everyone or the seller can only charge different prices based on the consumer\u2019s participation status, then aggregate consumer surplus under voluntary profiling is higher and a reduction in privacy cost has a positive impact on all consumers as well as the seller.  However, when personalized pricing is possible, reducing privacy cost alone may reduce aggregate consumer surplus.  The primary reason for these results is that voluntary profiling allows the seller to identify high valuation consumers that have no incentive to participate and set a higher price for them (compared to no profiling) while simultaneously benefitting from the profile information of low valuation consumers that participate.  However, a positive privacy cost mitigates the participation incentives of even low valuation consumers and hence sellers\u2019 ability to engage in price discrimination.","https://misq.umn.edu/is-voluntary-profiling-welfare-enhancing.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'consumer advocacy', 'price discrimination']","The article discusses consumer profiling and its implications for privacy and price discrimination, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in business practices.

Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation.  To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications.\n\n\t\tConsistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation.  In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI.  Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement.

Further, firms that pursue high risk innovations with more developers can be more profitable than firms that pursue low risk innovations with fewer developers.  More developers give platform firms more chances at success.

We consider the relationship between observed trust and three \u201crevealed preference\u201d tie strength measures:  (1) the degree of interaction between friends on their walls; (2) embeddedness, a metric related to the number of mutual friends shared; and (3) being tagged together in a photograph, indicative of a physical-world interaction.  We identify latent heterogeneity among our subjects, establishing that for users with a large number of Facebook friends, the only measure associated with trust is whether the dyad was tagged in a photo together.  In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust. Our findings are preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust like embeddedness, which are used widely in physical-world social networks, may not always be effective predictors of digital trust, because not all online social ties are created equal.

Modern consumers frequently switch between online and offline channels when they navigate through various stages of the decision journey, motivating multichannel sellers to develop omni-channel strategies that optimize their overall profit.  This study examines consumers\u2019 cross-channel search behavior of \u201cpseudo-showrooming,\u201d or the consumer behavior of inspecting one product at a seller\u2019s physical store before buying a related but different product at the same seller\u2019s online store, and investigates how such consumer behavior allows a multichannel seller to achieve better coordination between its online and offline arms through optimal product placement strategies.\n\nWe develop a stylized model in which a multichannel firm offers a product line consisting of two horizontally differentiated products.  Consumers are uncertain about the true value of either product.  A consumer\u2019s uncertainty regarding a particular product\u2019s value is fully resolved after inspecting that product in person, and can also be partially resolved after inspecting the other related product.  By selling only one product through the dual channel and the other product through the online channel exclusively, the firm induces consumer pseudo-showrooming for the online exclusive product.  Our analysis shows that this product placement strategy generates a greater profit than selling both products through the dual channel, if the fit probability of individual products and consumers\u2019 cost for returning a misfit product are both in the intermediate range.  Moreover, we find that over a large parameter region, consumers also enjoy a greater total surplus under the firm\u2019s product placement strategy that induces consumer pseudo-showrooming.  Furthermore, we find that the firm garners the most benefit from inducing consumer pseudo-showrooming by selling the higher-quality product or the higher-demand product through the online channel exclusively.  Collectively, our study offers a compelling demand-side justification of the commonly witnessed practice among multichannel sellers to offer products online exclusively when offline selling is feasible.\n\n05/15/17","https://misq.umn.edu/consumer-pseudo-showrooming-and-omni-channel-placement-strategies.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and profit optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper presents the systematic high-impact research model (SHIR), an approach to conducting high-impact research.  SHIR embodies the insight gained from three streams of high-impact research programs spanning more than 50 years.  The SHIR framework rests on the proposition that IS researchers can produce higher-impact contributions by developing long-term research programs around major real-world issues, as opposed to ad hoc projects addressing a small piece of a large problem.  These persistent research programs focus on addressing the entirety of an issue, by leveraging multidisciplinary, multiuniversity research centers that employ a breadth of research methods and large-scale projects.  To function effectively, SHIR programs must be sustained by academic and practitioner partnerships, research centers, and outreach activities.

On the basis of a novel dataset with 7,871 brand-day observations of over 131,000 expert blogs on major brands in the PC industry, this study reveals how expert blogs may act as a quality signal leading general consumers\u2019 perceptions of rival brands.  Our analyses reveal three key insights:  (1) Expert blog sentiments and volume on a focal brand have a positive relationship with consumer perceptions of the focal brand but a negative relationship with those of its competing brands.  (2) The focal brand\u2019s blogs have a reinforcing relationship with its subsequent blogs and a cannibalistic relationship with competitors\u2019 subsequent blogs.  (3) Brand position (leading versus non-leading in the market) plays a nontrivial role in these competitive, dynamic relationships.  For example, a 1 percent unexpected increase in Acer\u2019s expert blog sentiment would be associated with a 1.5 percent lift in its own brand quality as perceived by consumers, thus winning more consumer hearts and minds.  Also, a 1 percent unexpected increase in Acer\u2019s expert blog sentiment would be associated with a .7 percent (Toshiba) to 1.5 percent (Sony Vaio) drop in its rival brand quality, thus undermining consumer hearts and minds of competing brands in the same industry.  Also, the effects are asymmetrical across leading versus non-leading brands as a 1 percent unexpected increase in expert blog sentiment is associated with a 1.6 percent drop in rival-brand quality perceptions among consumers for non-leading brands, vis-\u00e0-vis only a 0.88 percent drop for leading brands.

However, communication patterns among virtual team members often resemble multiple monologues (in which team members broadcast what they know) rather than dialogues (in which team members mindfully share information they have and consider information from others).  The result is that team members often fail to integrate the new information they receive from other team members into their mental models, and decision quality suffers.  Collective mindfulness is a team-level process in which team members heedfully contribute to the team discussion, align their own actions with the actions of others, and develop shared mental models.  Collective mindfulness is more than a sum of individual mindfulness in much the same way that organizational learning is more than the sum of the individual learning of its members.  We compared teams using a traditional synchronous text chat tool to teams using a combination of tools designed to promote collective mindfulness (chat plus a whiteboard).  The results suggest that teams using chat plus the whiteboard had increased collective mindfulness, and that this increased collective mindfulness led to improved decision quality.  Not all teams were effective in using the whiteboard, indicating it was not the provision of the whiteboard that mattered, but rather how teams appropriated it.  We identified four appropriations, the combination of which led to increased collective mindfulness and decision quality:  information aggregation, discussion of information distribution, discussion of decision criteria, and voting.

Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling.  Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events.  However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes.  To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL).  Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models\u2014one for each event\u2014and communicate training information across the models.  The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously.  Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques.  More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions.

A number of these self-evolving, online customer support communities have reported the emergence of a core\u2013 periphery knowledge sharing network structure.  In this study, we investigate why such a structure emerges and its implications for knowledge sharing within the community.  We propose a dynamic structural model with endogenized knowledge-sharing and network formation.  Our model recognizes the dynamic and interdependent nature of knowledge seeking and sharing decisions and allows them to be driven by knowledge increments and social status building in anticipation of future reciprocal rewards from peers.\n\nApplying this model to a fine grained panel dataset from a social customer support forum for a telecom firm, we illustrate that a user in this community gains value from being linked to other individuals with higher social status.  As a result, a user is more inclined to answer the questions of those who are in the core (well connected) than questions from those who are in the periphery (not well connected).  We find that users are taking into account the expected likelihood of their questions receiving a solution before asking a question.  With the emergence of a core\u2013periphery network structure, peripheral individuals are discouraged from asking questions as their expectation of receiving a solution to their question is very low.  Thus, the core\u2013periphery structure has created a barrier to knowledge flow to new customers who need the knowledge the most.

Second, continuous attention from participants is assumed.  Third, such mechanisms are subject to various forms of market manipulation.

However, two self-selection biases, acquisition bias (mostly consumers with a favorable predisposition acquire a product and hence write a product review) and underreporting bias (consumers with extreme, either positive or negative, ratings are more likely to write reviews than consumers with moderate product ratings), render the mean rating a biased estimator of product quality, and they result in the well-known J-shaped (positively skewed, asymmetric, bimodal) distribution of online product reviews.  To better understand the nature and consequences of these two self-selection biases, we analytically model and empirically investigate how these two biases originate from consumers\u2019 purchasing and reviewing decisions, how these decisions shape the distribution of online product reviews over time, and how they affect the firm\u2019s product pricing strategy.  Our empirical results reveal that consumers do realize both self-selection biases and attempt to correct for them by using other distributional parameters of online reviews, besides the mean rating.  However, consumers cannot fully account for these two self-selection biases because of bounded rationality.  We also find that firms can strategically respond to these self-selection biases by adjusting their prices.  Still, since consumers cannot fully correct for these two self-selection biases, product demand, the firm\u2019s profit, and consumer surplus may all suffer from the two self-selection biases.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has mandated disclosure of reviewer compensation to address this potential conflict of interest, but the effect of such disclosures on consumer attitudes is unknown.  By extending prominence\u2013interpretation theory, this work reconciles conflicting empirical results by introducing two novel elements of prominence (i.e., proximity and embedding) and demonstrating the effect disclosures have on reviewer credibility through two experiments (N = 750).  The effects of social consensus and prior warnings on how consumers interpret disclosures are also studied.  Using a general population sample (N = 346), Experiment 1 demonstrated that proximity to review increased disclosure prominence while embedding the disclosure in the review decreased disclosure prominence.  More prominent disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but less prominent disclosures had no effect.  Using a student sample (N = 404), Experiment 2 demonstrated that disclosure interpretation is affected by prior warnings about conflicts of interest and the consensus of other reviews.  When there was disagreement between reviews and prior warnings were provided, disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but when there was a consensus of positive reviews or no consensus information was provided, disclosures had no effect.  Our studies show that both prominence and interpretation are important to consider in understanding the effects of disclosure statements.

However, the large amount of information in the reviews, coupled with conflicting opinions, can make it difficult for consumers to identify and consider those attributes relevant to their decision.  Thus, while online product reviews are generally believed to empower consumers, we suggest that they may have \u201cswaying\u201d effects in that attribute preferences (i.e., the relative importance consumers place on various product attributes in product evaluation) are more heavily influenced by characteristics of the online reviews rather than by the relevance of the attributes to the consumers\u2019 decision context.  We propose that three characteristics of online reviews affect the assessment of attribute preferences:  (1) the amount of information about attribute-level performance, which is often unevenly distributed across attributes, (2) the degree of information conflict about attribute-level performance, and (3) the relationship between the overall numeric rating and the attribute-level performance information in the reviews.  We test our hypotheses in two randomized experiments and a free simulation study.  Results from the three studies show that the three review characteristics influence attribute preferences and that their effects are strong enough such that attribute preferences are influenced more by these online review characteristics than by the relevance of the attributes to the consumers\u2019 decision context.

We examine product recommendation networks in e-commerce to investigate how the demand of a product is influenced by product network attributes in terms of network diversity and network stability.  We also examine whether the demand of a product is influenced by both the incoming network and the outgoing network, and if the effects differ between co-view and co-purchase recommendation networks.  Using data from Tmall.com for four product categories, we apply linear panel data models to examine the impact of network diversity and network stability on product demand, controlling for relevant factors at the individual product, pricing, product network, product category, and time unit levels.  Importantly, we account for implicit demand correlation (i.e., substitution and complementarity) and potential simultaneity of demand and network structures.  We unravel several important findings.  First, a 1% increase in the category diversity of the incoming (outgoing) co-purchase network of a product is associated with a 0.011% (0.012%) increase (decrease) in the product\u2019s demand.  Second, a 1% increase in the stability of the outgoing co-purchase network is associated with a 0.012% decrease in demand.

However, there is still a strong preference for being geographically proximal, notably when accessing capital markets for innovation activities, such as the formation of funding ties between venture capitalists (VCs) and new IT ventures.  While VCs prefer to support colocated entrepreneurs, significant evidence suggests that the funding of nonlocal IT entrepreneurs does occur.  In this work, we investigate how trends in the form of herding and media coverage, which are not specific to the entrepreneur but pertain to the technology sector in which the entrepreneur operates, may influence VCs to reach across geographic boundaries.  Using a series of matched sample methodologies, results suggest that the influence of media is significantly stronger for VCs considering funding non-colocated, as opposed to colocated, IT entrepreneurs.  However, and strikingly, support for the effect of herding is notably weaker.

An interesting feature of many large ITO arrangements is that the production assets necessary for service delivery are transferred to the vendor.  The argument in favor of such asset transfers, based in property rights theory, is that they are necessary to incentivize vendors to continue to invest in transaction-specific assets to improve service.  On the other hand, transaction cost economics predicts that transferring such assets increases bilateral dependence and will elevate the risk of post-contractual opportunistic behavior.  The contracting challenge in this context is to specify the terms of exchange to achieve the client\u2019s objectives for outsourcing while managing the risks of asset transfer.  We develop a theoretical framework to derive propositions on contract design in the presence of asset transfer.  We identify the importance of contractual clauses that mitigate the associated risks and the complementary role of compensation mechanisms, specifically the pricing scheme and IT-related performance incentives.  We have compiled a unique dataset that allows us to test our propositions by comparing ITO contracts that include asset transfer to those that do not.  We find that asset transfer does significantly affect contract design, manifested in the inclusion of clauses that protect both clients and vendors.  Outsourcing objectives are more likely to be met when contracts include compensation mechanisms that complement asset transfer.\n\n05/16/17","https://misq.umn.edu/information-technology-outsoucing-asset-transfer-and-the-role-of-contract.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['contract design', 'asset transfer', 'vendor', 'client objectives']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of information technology outsourcing and contract design, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We integrate ultimatum game theory, which focuses on fairness, with motivation theories to investigate the effects of social distance and monetary incentives on the performance of three competing designs for online referral systems:  rewarding only or primarily the proposer, rewarding only or primarily the responder, and dividing the reward equally or fairly between the proposer and responder.  A set of controlled laboratory and randomized field experiments were conducted to test how the fairness of the split of the reward (equal/fair versus unequal/unfair split of the referral bonus) and social distance (small versus large) between the proposer and the responder jointly affect the performance of online referral systems (the proposer sending an offer and the responder accepting the offer).  For a large social distance (acquaintances or weak tie relationships), equally splitting the referral bonus results in the best performance.  However, for a small social distance (friends or strong tie relationships), an equal split of the referral reward does not improve referral performance, which suggests that under a small social distance, monetary incentives may not work effectively.  Face validity and external validity (generalizability) are ensured using two distinct measures of social distance across several contexts.  Through the analysis of the interaction effects of fairness and social distance, our research offers theoretical and practical implications for social commerce by showing that the effectiveness of fairness on the success of online social referrals largely depends on social distance.\n\n05/16/17","https://misq.umn.edu/on-the-role-of-fairness-and-social-distance-in-designing-effective-social-referral-systems.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","6","['fairness', 'social distance', 'equally splitting', 'reward']","The article emphasizes fairness in the context of social referral systems, which aligns with themes of equity and social justice.

Consistent with the separation of oversight from management decisions, board-level ITG is responsible for monitoring managerial IT decisions and policies for controlling IT resources.  We expect that operational IT failures indicating inadequacies in board monitoring of controls over IT resources would result in a negative stock market reaction and, in turn, induce firms to improve their board-level ITG.  Our expectation is confirmed based on a sample of 110 operational IT failures from U.S. public financial firms.  Specifically, our results demonstrate that subsequent to experiencing operational IT failures, firms make improvements to the IT competency level of their boards, and the improvements are proportional to the degree of negative market reaction.  However, those improvements are only on the executive side of the board, namely:  an increase in the IT experience of internal (executive) directors and an increased turnover rate of CIOs serving on the board.  Furthermore, the likelihood of CIO turnover is lower in IT-intensive firms where such turnover could be more disruptive.

A Strategic Tool for Online Retailers to Benefit from Third-Party Information","Online retailing is dominated by a channel structure in which a retailer either buys products from competing manufacturers and resells to consumers (wholesale scheme) or lets manufacturers sell directly to consumers on its platform for a commission (platform scheme).  Easy access to publicly available third-party information such as product reviews that facilitate consumers\u2019 purchase decisions is another distinctive and ubiquitous characteristic of online retailing.  We show that retailers can use the upstream pricing scheme, wholesale or platform, as a strategic tool to benefit from third-party information.  Information on the quality dimension homogenizes consumers\u2019 perceived utility differences between competing products and increases the upstream competition, which benefits the wholesale-based retailer but hurts the platform-based retailer. Information on the fit dimension, in constrast, heterogenizes consumers\u2019 estimated fits to the products and softens the upstream competition, which hurts the wholesale-based retailer but benefits the platform-based retailer.  Consequently, when the precision of the third-party information is high (low), a retailer can benefit from third-party information by adopting the wholesale (platform) scheme if the quality dimension plays a dominant role and by adopting the platform (wholesale) scheme if the fit dimension is dominant.  Furthermore, the effect of precision improvement on the retailer\u2019s profit depends on the pricing-scheme choice and the relative importance of quality and fit attributes in consumers\u2019 evaluations of products.  For instance, when the fit dimension is dominant, increasing the precision can hurt the wholesale-based retailer but benefit the platform-based retailer. \n\n05/23/17","https://misq.umn.edu/platform-or-wholesale-a-strategic-tool-for-online-retailers-to-benefit-from-third-party-information.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online retailing and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Two empirical studies were conducted.  Study 1 examined consumer information diet for product reviews using the think-aloud approach.  Results showed that consumers use two different genres of product review information sequentially (1) to follow product attribute-oriented review information during the screening phase and (2) to forage for product usage-oriented review information during the evaluation phase.  The findings were extended to Study 2 through a field experiment, in which different patches of product reviews were purposefully and sequentially given in accordance with the consumer information diet for product reviews.

In this paper, we posit that these contradictions might be due to cross-level nonlinear causality between firm-level IT-based strategic actions and collective-level IT-induced hyperturbulence.  We develop a multilevel perspective of IS strategy for theorizing this causality, and unifying novel with established research.  Complex adaptive systems theory is employed as the overarching framework for its strength in formalizing cross-level nonlinear causal paths.  Using literature-based theorization and agent-based modeling, we establish two bottom-up nonlinear causal paths by which IT drives hyperturbulence:  IT can act as an external force (i.e., component IT innovation) to locally instigate firm strategic actions that aggregate to temporary hyperturbulence or as an internal force (i.e., architectural IT innovation) to drive pervasive firm strategic interactions that aggregate to persistent hyperturbulence.  Each causal path produces varied amounts of reducible and irreducible uncertainties and thereby renders a top-down nonlinear effect that reshapes the opportunity for IT to contribute to competitive advantage.  This multilevel theorization paves the way for new, IS-specific theory regarding IT\u2019s unique role in inducing nonlinear dynamics and in affording new business strategies in today\u2019s competitive environments.\n\n06/12/17","https://misq.umn.edu/unifying-the-role-of-it-in-hyperturbulence-and-competitive-advantage-via-a-multilevel-perspective-of-is-strategy.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information technology and its impact on competitive advantage without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Accounting for the Influence of Institutional Factors in the Context of Healthcare Data Breaches","In this study, we argue that institutional factors determine the extent to which hospitals are symbolic or substantive adopters of information technology (IT) specific organizational practices.  We then propose that symbolic and substantive adoption will moderate the effect that IT security investments have on reducing the incidence of data security breaches over time.  Using data from three different sources, we create a matched panel of over 5,000 U.S. hospitals and 938 breaches over the 2005\u20132013 time frame.  Using a growth mixture model approach to model the heterogeneity in likelihood of breach, we use a two class solution in which hospitals that (1) belong to smaller health systems, (2) are older, (3) smaller in size, (4) for-profit, (5) non-academic, (6) faith-based, and (7) less entrepreneurial with IT are classified as symbolic adopters.  We find that symbolic adoption diminishes the effectiveness of IT security investments, resulting in an increased likelihood of breach.  Contrary to our theorizing, the use of more IT security is not directly responsible for reducing breaches, but instead, institutional factors create the conditions under which IT security investments can be more effective.  Implications of these findings are significant for policy and practice, the most important of which may be the discovery that firms need to consider how adoption is influenced by institutional factors and how this should be balanced with technological solutions.  In particular, our results support the notion that deeper integration of security into IT-related processes and routines leads to fewer breaches, with the caveat that it takes time for these benefits to be realized.\n\n05/27/17","https://misq.umn.edu/when-do-it-security-investments-matter-accounting-for-the-influence-of-institutional-factors-in-the-context-of-healthcare-data-breaches.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['institutional factors', 'data security breaches', 'healthcare']","The article discusses the influence of institutional factors on IT security investments, which touches on ethical considerations in the context of healthcare data breaches.

Prior KMS research indicates many KMS implementations have failed to achieve their intended job outcomes, such as job performance and job satisfaction, and one important reason for failure could be that employees do not know how to use a KMS to enhance job outcomes.  Given that research on this topic is scant and the findings inconsistent, this paper sought to develop a better understanding of the topic.  Specifically, we examine how employees can use a small number of KMS features to get a majority of their job tasks done.  Limited research has used a systematic approach to identify these features, examined drivers of using these features, and impacts of the use of such features on job outcomes.  Based on a literature review, we first identified several KMS features.  Then, these features were examined using a qualitative study among 35 employees in a large organization in the finance industry to identify the key KMS features that could contribute positively to job outcomes.  We then developed a nomological network of KMS feature use.  Leveraging social network theory, we present peer support ties in general, and help-seeking ties and help-providing ties in particular, as key drivers of the use of these features and job outcomes.

Whereas there is an implicit understanding of these terms, no research has quantified what distinguishes one sourcing configuration from another or what institutional factors contribute to the pursuit of one strategy over the other.  We leverage institutional theory to examine how key organizational antecedents such as strategic orientation (mission), formal structure (size), and internal dynamics (patient case mix complexity) influence the rate at which organizations move toward or away from a single-sourcing configuration.  Employing longitudinal modeling combined with sequence analysis techniques, we empirically evaluate IS sourcing strategies of nearly all U.S. hospitals operating continuously over a 9-year time frame from 2005 to 2013.  We find that hospitals are generally trending toward a single-sourcing configuration and that formal structure and internal dynamics serve as predictors of this trend.  Contrary to the predictions of institutional theory, we find that strategic orientation is not predictive of IS sourcing strategy.  These results have important implications for research and practice.

Yet reservations have been voiced that this proposal is contrary to experience, incoherent, and of little practical use.  While not denying the phenomenon, the critics insist that the ontological commitment to separated entities must be maintained.  We show that Heidegger\u2019s work in Being and Time (1927, 1962) provides a careful exploration of ontological inseparability that reveals it to be plausible, coherent, and useful.  Although his terminology is alien, Heidegger\u2019s analysis proceeds from everyday experiences to provide a plausible account of ontological inseparability.  His work provides a coherent ontology that treats inseparability as fundamental, but also shows that our familiar dualist experience of the world, far from justifying ontological separation, is actually derivative.  We demonstrate the usefulness of Heidegger\u2019s concepts with a case.  Instead of proceeding from a priori separated categories meaningful to the researcher, Heidegger\u2019s concepts allow investigation of what IT \u201cis\u201d when involved in particular user worlds.

However, the vendor\u2019s ability to leverage the increased demand can be limited because of a commitment problem.  For, when the demand increases and the vendor accordingly sets a higher price, many consumers might opt not to upgrade, creating a situation where stopping security-related support simply becomes too risky.  To avoid this risk and any subsequent losses in reputation, the vendor can renege on its earlier decision to stop support.  We show that this commitment problem hurts the vendor\u2019s profitability and find that the no-commitment equilibrium profit can surprisingly increase with the cost to extend support.  Accordingly, we propose a commitment mechanism.

This paper proposes a system framework for extracting representative information from intra-organizational blogging platforms, as well as the REPSET (REPresentative SET) method, which serves as the core component of the extraction system.  Drawing from a novel clustering technique, REPSET is designed to identify a small set of items that largely represent the diversified content of a huge information base.  Building on REPSET, an extraction system enables managers to locate representative articles that may serve as starting points for comprehensively understanding the hot topics, prevailing thoughts, and emerging opinions among employees.  Empirical evaluations are conducted based on the massive database accumulated on an internal blogging platform at a large telecommunications company.  The results from data experiments and user evaluations demonstrate that REPSET and the extraction system upon which it is based can provide outstanding performance, in comparison with benchmark methods.","https://misq.umn.edu/extracting-representative-information-on-intra-organizational-blogging-platforms.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['diversified content', 'emerging ideas', 'issues', 'opportunities']","The article discusses understanding emerging ideas and issues within organizations, which hints at a focus on employee perspectives.

These websites, however, differ in their choice to reveal aggregate review statistics on the product list displayed while consumers browse or search to make initial product selections.  This study proposes an analytical model to examine the conditions in which revealing average star ratings on the product list is more profitable than not revealing this information.  Noting that consumers differ in their valuations of products sold on a firm\u2019s website, this study finds that if a firm sets prices to maximize total profits, it suffers less profitability from disclosing average star ratings if two products do not differ significantly in their average value and consumers\u2019 valuation of the low-value product is more heterogeneous.  If products sold on the website instead are priced by third-party sellers that seek to maximize each product\u2019s own profit, it is less profitable for the firm to reveal average rating information when the two products do not differ significantly in average value and consumers\u2019 valuation of the high-value product is more heterogeneous.  These results suggest guidelines that retail websites can use to evaluate their information revelation policies, based on three important factors:  the difference in the average value of different products, relative heterogeneity in consumers\u2019 valuation of different products, and the firm\u2019s ability to coordinate prices across products.\n\n7/18/17","https://misq.umn.edu/revealing-or-non-revealing-the-impact-of-review-disclosure-policy-on-firm-profitability.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on profitability and technical aspects of review disclosure policies without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Building on the social presence theory, we propose a number of hypotheses on how social network integration affects review volume and linguistic features of review text.  We consider two natural experiments at leading online review platforms (Yelp.com and TripAdvisor.com), wherein each implemented a social network integration with Facebook.  Constructing a unique panel dataset of online reviews for a matched set of restaurants across the two review sites, we estimate a difference-in-differences (DID) model to assess the impact of social network integration.  We find that integration with Facebook increased the production of user-generated content and positive emotion in review text, while simultaneously decreasing cognitive language, negative emotion, and expressions of disagreement (negations) in review text.  Our findings demonstrate that social network integration works as a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, integration provides benefits in terms of increased review quantity.  On the other hand, these benefits appear to come at the cost of reduced review quality, given past research which has found that positive, emotional reviews are perceived by users to be less helpful.

We model the development of IT standards by technology suppliers as a coevolutionary technological search process under supply-side network effects, and we examine how the characteristics of the standards development process influence its outcomes.  In line with common intuition and prior research, we find that perfect coordination among suppliers generally facilitates convergence on the best available standard.  However, for complex IT standards, we make a novel contribution and find that this \u201cbest available\u201d standard may be inferior to alternative, undiscovered solutions because coordination may lead to an overly narrow search.  Consistent with prior research, we also find that either highly influential organizations or highly influential alliances and consortia can coordinate standard selection in order to prevent network effects from generating lock-in to an inferior option and to help set the best of the known alternatives as the standard.  However, in contrast to the previous literature, we find that when coordination is imperfect and controlled by a moderately influential organization or consortium, it may lead to a technological lock-in dynamic in which suppliers adhere to an inferior solution and are subsequently unable to reverse this commitment, even when a technologically superior alternative emerges later in the search process.  Further, we reveal the following paradox involving intellectual property rights (IPR) and related imitation costs:  Although imitation costs can lead to the emergence of multiple standards, thereby reducing social welfare in the short term, this effect may have long-term benefits by broadening the search for future generations of a standard. \n\n8/24/17","https://misq.umn.edu/supply-side-network-effects-and-the-development-of-information-technology-standards.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['standards', 'network effects', 'coordination', 'technological lock-in']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of information technology standards and their development processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions.

Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reflects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity. Based on the \u201cbeauty in averageness\u201d effect, we hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative.

In a market characterized by demand uncertainty, colluding retailers wish to share information about the potential market demand to coordinate on the optimal collusive retail price. However, in light of potential exposure to antitrust investigations and possible sanctions, the retailers search for mechanisms to exchange information while avoiding the risks of scrutiny by the antitrust authorities. This paper examines such a mechanism: each retailer shares his private information with the mutual manufacturer; the wholesale price set by the latter is thereafter used by the retailers to infer the market condition and coordinate on the cartel\u2019s price. Although a cartel at the retail level limits the manufacturer\u2019s sold quantity, under certain conditions the manufacturer is better off accepting the retailers\u2019 private information, thereby assisting the cartel formation.

Multiple spillover effects are found, suggesting that while SMCs can be used primarily to stimulate WOM for a focal product, marketers must also account for brand- and category-level WOM spillover effects. Specifically, seeding increases conversations about that product among nonseed consumers, and, interestingly, decreases WOM about other products from the same brand and about competitors\u2019 products in the same category as the focal product.

While the field of marketing has long been aware of the distinction between attributes and benefits, it has not developed methods for understanding how attributes and benefits are related. This paper develops a benefit-based model for conjoint analysis that assumes consumers satiate on attributes that are perceived to provide the same benefit. A latent-variable model is proposed that estimates the map between attributes and benefits, and is applied to data from two conjoint studies involving a durable product and a household consumable. The model is shown to fit the data better, provide improved predictions, and lead to different product design implications than the standard conjoint model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1003","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and consumer utility without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

For example, Marriott International manages high-end ultra-luxury hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton) and low-end economy hotels (e.g., Fairfield Inn). Firms often bundle core products with ancillary services (or add-ons). Interestingly, empirical observations reveal that industries with ostensibly similar characteristics (e.g., customer types, costs, competition, distribution channels, etc.) employ different bundling strategies. For example, airlines bundle high-end first class with ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) while hotel chains bundle ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) at the low-end. We observe, unlike hotel lines that are highly differentiated at different geographic locations, airlines suffer low core differentiation because all passengers (first-class and economy) are at the same location (i.e., same plane, weather, delays, cancellations, etc.). In general, we find product lines with low core differentiation (e.g., airlines, amusement parks) routinely bundle high-end while product lines with highly differentiated cores (e.g., hotels, restaurants) routinely bundle low-end. High-end bundling makes the high-end more attractive, increasing line differentiation (less intraline competition) while low-end bundling decreases line differentiation. Therefore, bundling allows optimal differentiation given a differentiation constraint (complex costs). Last, firms may use strategic bundling for targeting in their core products; e.g., low-end hotels bundle targeted add-ons unattractive to high-end consumers such as lower-quality breakfasts and slower Internet.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product bundling strategies in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that expanding product line breadth has a significant effect on increasing mismatch costs arising from the increased demand uncertainty associated with product proliferation. These mismatch costs are manifested through additional discounts and inventories. The effect of product line breadth on mismatch costs is comparable in magnitude to the effect on production costs, suggesting that the operational benefits of inventory pooling achievable by rationalizing product lines can be very substantial. Furthermore, we quantify the benefit of using a platform strategy to mitigate the effects of a broad product line on production costs. Finally, we propose an additional, attribute-based measure of product line breadth and find that product line breadth can work as a hedge against changes in demand conditions. For example, automakers that offer a broader range of fuel economy levels increase their market share and reduce their average discounts as gas prices become more volatile.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0979","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on operational aspects of product line breadth and its economic implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper documents that this may not hold when a firm faces competition. With advance selling a firm offers its service in an advance period, before consumers know their valuations for the firms\u2019 services, or later on in a spot period, when consumers know their valuations. We identify two ways in which competition limits the effectiveness of advance selling. First, while a monopolist can sell to consumers with homogeneous preferences at a high price, this homogeneity intensifies price competition, which lowers profits. However, the firms may nevertheless find themselves in an equilibrium with advance selling. In this sense, advance selling is better described as a competitive necessity rather than as an advantageous tool to raise profits. Second, competition in the spot period is likely to lower spot period prices, thereby forcing firms to lower advance period prices, which is also not favorable to profits. Rational firms anticipate this and curtail or eliminate the use of advance selling. Thus, even though a monopolist fully exploits the practice of advance selling, rational firms facing competition either mitigate it or avoid it completely.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1006","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic implications of advance selling in competitive markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

More specifically, this new framework, which we call a vector changepoint model, exploits the underlying regime structure in a sequence of acquired customer cohorts to make predictive statements about new cohorts for which the firm has little or no longitudinal transaction data. To accomplish this, we develop our model within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to uncover evidence of (latent) regime changes for each cohort-level parameter separately, while disentangling cross-cohort changes from calendar-time changes. Calibrating the model using multicohort donation data from a nonprofit organization, we find that holdout predictions for new cohorts using this model have greater accuracy\u2014and greater diagnostic value\u2014compared to a variety of strong benchmarks. Our modeling approach also highlights the perils of pooling data across cohorts without accounting for cross-cohort shifts, thus enabling managers to quantify their uncertainty about potential regime changes and avoid \u201cold data\u201d aggregation bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1007","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for customer analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, we show that higher quality can prevent the copycat from successfully entering the market. Finally, we show that the entry of copycats does not always improve consumer surplus and social welfare. In particular, when the quality of the copycat is sufficiently low, the loss in status utility from consumers of the incumbent product overshadows the small gain in consumption utility from buyers of the copycat, leading to an overall decrease in consumer surplus and social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1008","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer surplus', 'social welfare', 'status utility']","The article primarily focuses on a game-theoretic model related to market dynamics and consumer behavior, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

As a result, banks extend their lending to riskier loans than they would have in the absence of the policy. We find this policy may even harm consumers. Moreover, market competition magnifies the lack of market discipline and induces additional moral hazard for excessive risk taking. Counterfactuals indicate banks may reduce their deposit interest rates by 2.7% in a duopoly market and almost triple their risk caps under the new policy.

The results highlight the degree of homophily with the adopting stock as well as the level of customer uncertainty as key characteristics determining the nature of the effect of stock information. In particular, information about a large existing adoption stock generates a positive effect on adoption only under moderate customer uncertainty combined with sufficient homophily; in other levels of uncertainty and/or homophily we find effects ranging from null to negative.

The data come from two field experiments involving purchases of a consumer good bundled with a charitable donation. Across experimental cells, we randomize the price level and the donation level. A model-free analysis of the data reveals nonmonotonic regions of demand when the good is bundled with relatively large charitable donations. Subjects also self-report lower ratings of \u201cfeeling good about themselves\u201d when offered bundles with large donations and price discounts. The evidence suggests that price discounts crowd out consumer self-inference of altruism. Alternative motivation-crowding theories are rejected due to their inability to explain the nonmonotonic data moments. The standard use of interaction effects and other falsification checks to explore the underlying choice mechanism in an experimental setting is complicated in our self-signaling context. Instead, a novel feature of our analysis consists of using the experimental data to estimate the structural form of a model of consumer demand with self-signaling. We specify a model in which consumers obtain both consumption and ego utility from their choices. Ego utility derives from a consumer\u2019s posterior self-beliefs after making her choice. An estimator is proposed that handles the potential multiplicity of equilibria that can arise in the self-signaling model. The model estimates allow us to quantify the economic role of ego utility and to explore the underlying signaling mechanism. Nested tests reject the hypothesis of no self-signaling. Alternative model specifications that potentially allow for nonmontonic demand without the self-signaling structure exhibit an inferior fit to the data. The model estimates imply that consumer response to the donations are mainly driven by ego utility and not by consumption utility (i.e., not by altruistic motives). The findings from the combination of a field experiment and a structural model contribute to a growing literature on self-signaling and consumer behavior by quantifying the magnitude of self-signaling on preferences and choices. The results also have implications for the design of a cause marketing campaign and the potential negative synergies between price and nonprice promotions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1012","","MKS","Marketing","5","['prosocial', 'charitable donation', 'ego utility']","The article explores the relationship between consumer behavior and charitable donations, indicating a moderate focus on prosocial behavior and ethics in marketing.

When the data generating process differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however, only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less) when sales are low (high).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1010","","MKS","Marketing","2","['nonprofit', 'advertising', 'managerial outcomes']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of marketing resource management and model estimation, with only a brief mention of nonprofit organizations, which does not strongly emphasize social justice or progressive themes.

Using data from the HIV/AIDS category, a canonical example of combination therapy, we estimate a hierarchical Bayesian logit model across treatment regimens and show that detailing for one drug can increase demand for other drugs that are often combined with the focal drug. Such spillover effects could lead to free riding by the drugs benefitting from the spillover. We investigate the managerial and policy implications of detailing spillover effects via counterfactual policy simulations based on a dynamic oligopoly game of detailing. For managers, we show how firms can internalize the spillover effects and reduce the incentive for free riding. For policy makers, the implications of our findings relate to detailing restrictions that are often proposed on branded drugs. These restrictions aim to increase social welfare by encouraging the use of generic drugs. However, in combination therapies generic drugs may actually benefit from the detailing of complementary branded products. If detailing was curtailed, this could adversely affect generic drug prescriptions as well, which runs counter to policy makers\u2019 objectives of encouraging use of generic drugs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1014","","MKS","Marketing","5","['social welfare', 'generic drugs', 'policy implications']","The article discusses social welfare and policy implications related to drug detailing, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in marketing practices.

This paper explores whether and under what conditions allowing competitor advertising in one\u2019s store may be a beneficial strategy. We analyze a duopoly market where customers are heterogeneous in search costs, information, and preferences. We find that hosting a competitor ad for an undifferentiated product can mitigate price competition and boost profits of both firms if the advertising commission is high enough. Otherwise, hosting competitor advertising may decrease the profits of both firms. Thus, there is no conflict of interest between firms in advertising and in setting the ad commission level. Yet the host prefers more efficient ads while the advertiser does not. Furthermore, the equilibrium outcome is asymmetric, with only one store featuring ads of the other. If stores are sufficiently differentiated in marginal costs of the product, the cost disadvantaged store will be the host. We show that the results are robust to displaying price in the ad, to different commission structures, and to customer uncertainty about the commission rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1015","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive marketing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper investigates the marketing strategy implications for firms competing for business, and for the buyer in a corruptible market. We consider a setting in which a buyer (a firm or government) seeks to purchase a good through a corruptible agent. Supplier firms that may or may not be a good fit compete to be selected by the agent. Only the agent observes whether a firm is a good fit. Corruption arises due to the agent\u2019s incentive to select a nondeserving firm in exchange for bribes. Intuitively and as expected, a sufficiently large monitoring of the agent eradicates corruption. Interestingly, however, increasing the monitoring from an initial low level can backfire, making the agent more likely to select a nondeserving firm.

We study whether the dyadic compromise effect (DCE) exists, the association between dyadic and individual compromise effects, and strategies to mitigate the DCE. We build a statistical model of dyadic choice that formally incorporates DCE. We conduct two studies to test our proposed models empirically. In Study 1, we begin with an investigation of the DCE with student subjects. In Study 2, we test for the presence of DCE among married couples when making retirement investment choices. In both studies, model-free and model-based evidence provides strong support for the presence of DCE. A model that incorporates DCE provides a better fit than models that do not. Evidence in support of DCE is shown to be robust to alternative compromise effect model specifications and utility aggregation methods. We find that the individual compromise effect tendency of a group member with a greater stake in the decision is likely to persist as a DCE in the joint choice setting.

Although the majority of cases can be managed by preventive care, most consumers opt for more expensive curative care that leads to a substantial increase in overall costs. To examine these inefficiencies, we build a model of consumers\u2019 annual medical insurance plan decisions and periodic consumption decisions and apply it to a panel data set. Our results indicate that there exists a sizable segment of consumers who purchase more comprehensive plans than needed because of high uncertainty vis-\u00e0-vis their health status, and that once in the plan, they opt for curative care even when their illness could be managed through preventive care. We examine how changing cost-sharing characteristics of insurance plans and providing more accurate information to consumers via secondary preventive care can reduce these inefficiencies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1021","","MKS","Marketing","2","['healthcare', 'consumption', 'preventive care']","The article primarily focuses on healthcare consumption decisions and inefficiencies in insurance choices, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Unlike previous empirical studies of behavioral price discrimination, which rely only on differences in price elasticity across customers, our pricing model allows the firm strategies to additionally account for differences in price elasticity across time (due to switching costs). We estimate a dynamic pricing model using empirical data from the cola category and, through a series of counterfactuals, we find that the retailer should simply outsource the data analytics and customization of coupons to manufacturers and improve its profit beyond what it can achieve by proactively couponing on its own. We further find that serving as an information broker to sell its customer database to manufacturers can be a vital source of profit to the retailer. By contrast, manufacturers end up worse off, illustrating that customer information is a potent source of channel power to the retailer.

In our framework, a brand\u2019s value is the expected net present value of future cash flows accruing to a firm due to its brand. Our brand value measure recognizes that a firm can change its brand equity by investing in advertising. We estimate quarterly brand values in the stacked chips category for the period 2001\u20132006 and explore how those values change over time. Comparing our brand value measure to its static counterpart, we find that a static measure, which ignores advertising and its ability to affect brand equity dynamics, yields brand values that are artificially high and that fluctuate too much over time. We also explore how changing the ability to build and sustain brand equity affects brand value. At our estimated parameterization, if brand equity were to depreciate more slowly, or if advertising were more effective at building brand equity, then brand value would increase. However, counterintuitively, we find that when the effectiveness of advertising is sufficiently high, increasing the rate at which brand equity depreciates can increase the value of a firm\u2019s brand, even as it reduces the value of the firm overall.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1020","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of brand management and value estimation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known \u201clearn-and-earn\u201d trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser\u2019s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.1023","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

I show that the role of an add-on differs; higher-quality firms prefer to sell it as optional to discriminate consumers, and lower-quality firms trade off discrimination and differentiation, trying to lure consumers from higher-quality rivals with a lower-price add-on. Equilibrium policies of lower-quality firms are more sensitive to the cost-to-value ratio of an add-on. If the ratio is sufficiently small, then they sell it to all consumers, potentially explaining why lower-end hotels are more likely than higher-end ones to offer free Internet service. Contrary to consensus in the literature, optional add-ons can intensify price competition over consumers who trade off a higher-quality base product versus a lower-quality base including an add-on. Hence, higher-quality firms are incentivized to commit to bundling, while lower-quality firms prefer to commit to not selling it. Add-ons can further reduce lower-quality firms\u2019 profits if consumers cannot observe the prices, because holding up consumers ex post encourages them to switch to higher-quality rivals, which then become better off.

Can distribution help us better understand entry-order effects on market shares? This paper examines how the first entrant in a geographical market achieves a market-share advantage through distribution. For this purpose, I propose a simple method of decomposing sales into physical distribution and sales performance. The data come from a manually collected panel on six major Japanese convenience-store chains from 47 geographical markets between 1991 and 2007. Using an instrumental variable approach to address the potential endogeneity of entry order, I find first entrants have a positive market-share advantage over later entrants. Specifically, the physical distribution, measured by the number of outlets in a market, drives most of the advantage. Meanwhile, the positive effect on sales performance for the first chain brand becomes nonexistent when I control for the outlet density. This paper further finds that the density of own outlets is nonmonotonically (inverted U) related to sales performance per outlet, suggesting dynamic outlet expansion faces a trade-off between the business-stealing effect in a chain (\u201ccannibalization\u201d) and the advertising effect through repetition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1029","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market-share advantages and distribution strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The firm sells older, less desirable merchandise through outlet stores to prevent cannibalization of regular store revenues by means of exploiting the positive correlation between consumers\u2019 travel sensitivity and taste for new products.

Our method has two distinct advantages. First, we endogenize a consumer response to the ranking using search refinement tools, such as sorting and filtering of product options. Accounting for these search refinement actions is important since the ranking and consumer search actions together shape the consideration set from which clicks are made. Second, rankings are targeted to anonymous consumers by relating price sensitivity to request parameters, such as the length of stay, number of guests, and day of the week of the stay.

Products are defined at the level of the stock-keeping unit. Two institutional features are key to identifying the causal effect: First, the monopolist uses four levels of retail distribution; a change in retail distribution is therefore associated with a discrete shift in the number of stores that carry a product in a given month. Second, the retailer is legally bound and monitored by the European Union to ensure that it acts in a non-discriminatory manner with all its suppliers. These features allow us to rule out many possible confounding factors in estimating the effect of distribution on sales volume. We find large and statistically significant effects from changes in retail distribution on market share by volume across all levels of retail distribution. The associated volume elasticity of retail distribution is convex; the wider the retail distribution the greater the marginal volume increase from further widening. In this market, wider distribution means reaching stores with successively smaller assortment. Our results indicate that the smaller assortment in smaller stores, coupled with a low resistance to compromise, is the main reason for the convex pattern. In other words, convexity appears to be generated by products achieving \u201ca larger share of a smaller pie\u201d as retail distribution expands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1038","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of retail distribution and its impact on sales without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The framework uses individual-level transaction data to fit empirical models of consumer response to marketing efforts and uses these estimates to optimize segmentation and targeting. The models feature themes emphasized in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and state dependence into choice, and controls for the endogeneity of the firm\u2019s historical targeting rule in estimation. To control for the endogeneity, we present an approach that involves conducting estimation separately across fixed partitions of the score variable that targeting is based on, which may be useful in other behavioral targeting settings. The models are customized to facilitate casino operations and are implemented at the MGM Resorts International\u2019s group of companies. The framework is evaluated using a randomized trial implemented at MGM involving about 1.5 million consumers. Using the new model produces about $1 million to $5 million in incremental profits per campaign, translating to about 20\u00a2 in incremental profit per dollar spent relative to the status quo. At current levels of marketing spending, this implies between $10 million and $15 million in incremental annual profit for the firm. The case study underscores the value of using empirically relevant marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for firms in real-world settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1039","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of marketing analytics and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of such a setting. We first consider a centralized channel and characterize the optimal decisions by establishing relationships that must hold between the elasticity of cost of quality and the elasticity of revenue and show that quality and inventory are strategic substitutes. Next, we consider a decentralized channel with a wholesale price contract, in which a manufacturer determines quality and wholesale price, while a retailer determines inventory and retail price. We find that, different from the case without endogenous inventory, product quality can be higher in a decentralized channel compared to a centralized channel, and this is because a wholesale price contract shields the manufacturer from inventory risk. For both centralized and decentralized channels, we find that as demand uncertainty increases, quality decreases, while, different from the case without endogenous quality, inventory can be U-shaped. Interestingly, to mitigate the impact of demand uncertainty on profit, quality can be a more effective lever than inventory in a centralized channel; however, in a decentralized channel, quality is less responsive and inventory is more responsive to demand uncertainty than in a centralized channel.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1041","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product quality and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2017","36","5","Davide ProserpioDavide Proserpioproserpi@marshall.usc.eduMarshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089Search for more papers by this author, Georgios Zervas\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Georgios Zervaszg@bu.eduQuestrom School of Business, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215Search for more papers by this author","Online Reputation Management: Estimating the Impact of Management Responses on Consumer Reviews","We investigate the relationship between a firm\u2019s use of management responses and its online reputation.

Second, hotels respond to positive, negative, and neutral reviews at roughly the same rate. Third, by exploiting variation in the rate with which hotels respond on different review platforms and variation in the likelihood with which consumers are exposed to management responses, we find a 0.12-star increase in ratings and a 12% increase in review volume for responding hotels. Interestingly, when hotels start responding, they receive fewer but longer negative reviews. To explain this finding, we argue that unsatisfied consumers become less likely to leave short indefensible reviews when hotels are likely to scrutinize them.

While most firms use procyclical spending (spending less during economic contractions), academic studies often recommend countercyclical spending (spending more during contractions), which begs the following question: What is the right thing to do? The spending problem is compounded further when demand is not just driven by one country\u2019s business cycle, but by the (nonsynchronized) business cycles of multiple countries, as is the case for tourism marketing aiming to attract tourists originating from different countries. We derive insights into the best way to allocate marketing budgets across countries under varying economic conditions. We show that the allocation decisions are driven by the procyclical versus countercyclical nature of three factors: unit sales, marketing effectiveness, and per-unit profit contribution. To study how unit sales and marketing effectiveness respond to the business cycle, we develop a transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model. We also model the responsiveness of the profit contribution to the business cycle. In an application to New Zealand tourism marketing, we find that a reallocation of the government\u2019s marketing budget could yield an increase in tourist revenues of NZD $121 million.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1046","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing budget allocation based on economic cycles without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We calibrate the model on 761,962 online reviews of restaurants posted over eight years. Our model allows managers to specify prior topics of interest such as \u201chealth\u201d for a calorie posting regulation. It also allows the distribution of topic proportions within a review to be affected by its length, valence, and the experience level of its author. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we isolate the potentially causal effect of the regulation on consumer opinion. Following the regulation, there was a statistically small but significant increase in the proportion of discussion of the health topic. This increase can be attributed largely to authors who did not post reviews before the regulation, suggesting that the regulation prompted several consumers to discuss health in online restaurant reviews.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1048","","MKS","Marketing","4","['calorie posting', 'health', 'consumer opinion']","The article discusses the impact of calorie posting regulations on consumer discussions about health, indicating a moderate focus on public health and consumer awareness.

We identify three types of transactions: (i) money transfers to others, (ii) short-distance money self-transportation, and (iii) money storage for short to medium periods of time. We utilize a natural experiment of an unanticipated increase in transaction fees to identify the demand for these transactions. Using the demand estimates, we find that the willingness to pay to avoid walking with cash an extra kilometer (short-distance self-transportation) and to avoid storing money at home (money storage) for an extra day are 1.25% and 0.8% of an average transaction, respectively, which demonstrates that mobile money ameliorates significant amounts of crime-related risk. We explore the implications of these estimates for pricing and demonstrate the profitability of incentive-compatible price discrimination based on type of service, consumer location, and distance between transaction origin and destination.

Self-Matching as a Retailer\u2019s Multichannel Pricing Strategy","Multichannel retailing has created several new strategic choices for retailers. With respect to pricing, an important decision is whether to offer a \u201cself-matching policy,\u201d which allows a multichannel retailer to offer the lowest of its online and store prices to consumers. In practice, we observe considerable heterogeneity in self-matching policies: There are retailers who offer to self-match and retailers who explicitly state that they will not match prices across channels. Using a game-theoretic model, we investigate the strategic forces behind the adoption (or non-adoption) of self-matching across a range of competitive scenarios, including a monopolist, two competing multichannel retailers, as well as a mixed duopoly. Though self-matching can negatively impact a retailer when consumers pay the lower price, we uncover two novel mechanisms that can make self-matching profitable in a duopoly setting. Specifically, self-matching can dampen competition online and enable price discrimination in-store. Its effectiveness in these respects depends on the decision-making stage of consumers and the heterogeneity of their preference for the online versus store channels. Surprisingly, self-matching strategies can also be profitable when consumers use \u201csmart\u201d devices to discover online prices in stores. Our findings provide insights for managers on how and when self-matching can be an effective pricing strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1035","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on multichannel retailing and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors estimate multiple dimensions of chatter (popularity, negativity, visibility, and virality) from numerous raw metrics using the content and the hyperlink structure of consumer reviews and blogs. The authors use the method of synthetic control to construct a counterfactual (synthetic) brand as a convex combination of the rivals during the preadvertising period. The gap in the dimensions of chatter between the focal brand and the synthetic brand in the test versus advertising periods assesses the influence of advertising. Offline television advertising causes a short but significant positive effect on online chatter. This effect is stronger on information-spread dimensions (visibility and virality) than on content-based dimensions (popularity and negativity).

We test mobile targeting based on consumers\u2019 real-time and historic locations, allowing us to evaluate popular mobile coupon strategies in a competitive market. The experiment reveals substantial profit gains from mobile discounts during an off-peak period. Both firms could create incremental profits by targeting their competitor\u2019s location.

Interestingly, competitive responses raise the profitability of behavioral targeting where symmetric pricing incentives soften price competition. By contrast, competitive responses lower the profitability of geographic targeting, where asymmetric pricing incentives toughen price competition. If we endogenize targeting choice, both firms would choose behavioral targeting in equilibrium, even though more granular geobehavioral targeting combining both real-time and historic locations is possible.

We develop a structural model to characterize advertisers\u2019 keyword market entry decisions.

Our analysis leads to several interesting findings. First, an advertiser\u2019s expected position affects the nature of the competition. In particular, the spillover effect from below-ranked competitors is always positive, while the spillover effect from above-ranked competitors is either positive or negative. Second, the spillover effect from above-ranked ads is directionally affected by firms\u2019 product-line characteristics: the effect among firms offering homogenous products (e.g., comparison sites) is negative, whereas the effect among firms with more differentiated products (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) is positive. Third, the spillover effect from above-ranked ads is directionally affected by firms\u2019 positions in a distribution channel: the effect from upstream (downstream) on downstream (upstream) firms tends to be negative (positive). Finally, a downstream firm is more likely to learn new keywords from an upstream firm but not vice versa.

Often, such competitors have to engage in defensive marketing at the category level without complete certainty about whether a recall will occur or not. Such defensive effort could then lead to a change in postrecall sales effort directed at capturing market share in that category. This decision is affected by the probability of the recall and the size of the loyal segment in the category facing the recall, i.e., physicians who will continue to prescribe the category even without marketing effort. We focus on competitor reaction to product recalls where the competitor participates in multiple product categories that exhibit (dis)economies of scope in sales effort across them. Equilibrium analysis of our game-theoretic model uncovers several managerial insights that illustrate the importance of scale (dis)economies on the competitor\u2019s promotional strategy in the wake of a recall. First, economies of scope across the two products leads to either an increase or decrease in postrecall sales effort for both products simultaneously depending on the loyal market size for the category.

Given the pressure from the Department of Justice, Google agreed to ban pharmacies not certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) from sponsored search listings. Using comScore click-through data originated from health-related queries, we study how the ban affects consumer search and click behavior in a difference-in-differences framework using the synthetic control method. We find that non-NABP-certified pharmacies received fewer clicks after the ban, and this effect is heterogeneous. In particular, pharmacies not certified by the NABP but certified by other sources (other-certified websites), experienced an increase in organic clicks that partially offset the loss in paid clicks after the ban. By contrast, pharmacies not certified by any certification agency experience much lower rates of substitution in organic clicks. These results suggest that the ban has increased the search cost for other-certified websites, but at least some consumers overcome the search cost by switching from sponsored to organic links. The lower substitution for uncertified websites may be explained by the rising consumer concerns about the quality of drugs sold on uncertified websites after the ban.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1058","","MKS","Marketing","3","['consumer concerns', 'quality', 'certification']","The article discusses consumer concerns regarding the quality of prescription drugs sold online, which touches on ethical considerations in marketing practices.

We find a consistent linear decline in financial literacy score after age 60. A nearly identical rate of decline among men, stockowners, older, and college-educated respondents indicates that cohort effects are not driving the results.

The limiting distribution of the test statistic is bounded by a chi-squared distribution under general sampling schemes, allowing for conservative large-sample testing. We develop a tight numerical approximation for the test statistic based on a two-stage optimization procedure and piecewise linearization techniques.

Although these retailers seem to share the intuition that probabilistic free price promotions are attractive to consumers, it is unclear how they compare to traditional sure price promotions of equal expected monetary value. We compared these two risky and sure price promotions for planned purchases across six experiments in the field and in the laboratory. Together, we found that consumers are not only more likely to purchase a product promoted with a probabilistic free discount over the same product promoted with a sure discount but that they are also likely to purchase more of it. This preference seems to be primarily due to a diminishing sensitivity to the prices. In addition, we find that the zero price effect, transaction cost, and novelty considerations are likely not implicated.

The central planner allocates subsidies to its producers, subject to a budget constraint and endogenous market response. The policy most commonly implemented in practical applications of this problem is uniform, in the sense that it allocates the same per-unit subsidy to every firm, primarily because of its simplicity and perceived fairness. Surprisingly, we identify sufficient conditions of the firms\u2019 marginal costs such that uniform subsidies are optimal, even if the firms\u2019 efficiency levels are arbitrarily different. Moreover, this insight is usually preserved even if the central planner is uncertain about the specific market conditions. Further in many cases, uniform subsidies simultaneously attain the best social welfare solution. Additionally, simulation results in relevant settings where uniform subsidies are not optimal suggest that they induce a nearly optimal market consumption. On the other hand, if the firms face a fixed cost of entry to the market, then the performance of uniform subsidies can be significantly worse, suggesting the need for an alternative policy in this setup.

Specifically, we ask whether firms should optimally produce \u201cbetter\u201d products when consumers are more likely to exchange information. The critical moderating factor in our model is the nature of the communication and what its primary impact is. We first look at WOM that expands awareness of a product. We show that quality may either increase or decrease as WOM expands. The answer depends, in part, on the extent to which the expansion of WOM is one of scale alone or whether it also fundamentally changes the structure of communications. Next, we examine a model in which the primary impact of WOM is to help people to evaluate the utility provided by products with which they are already familiar. Our model suggests that more WOM in this context should always lead to higher-quality products. We demonstrate that the underlying driver of this result is that the elasticity of demand with respect to quality is increasing in the proportion of consumers who are informed about the product\u2019s quality. Taken together, the two models therefore suggest that the firm\u2019s optimal product-policy response to the growth in social interactions depends on both the content and the structure of the underlying conversations. Finally, we compare both WOM models to analogous models of advertising and demonstrate that the firm\u2019s optimal response to a decrease in advertising costs is quite different from that to an increase in WOM. The reason for these differences can be traced back to a fundamental distinction between advertising and WOM: although the former is optimized, the latter is far more random.

An Empirical Study","In this paper, we explore the impact of delay announcements using an empirical approach by analyzing the data from a medium-sized call center. We first explore the question of whether delay announcements impact customers\u2019 behavior using a nonparametric approach. The answer to this question appears to be ambiguous. We thus turn to investigate the fundamental mechanism by which delay announcements impact customer behavior, by constructing a dynamic structural model. In contrast to the implicit assumption made in the literature that announcements do not directly impact customers\u2019 waiting costs, our key insights show that delay announcements not only impact customers\u2019 beliefs about the system but also directly impact customers\u2019 waiting costs. In particular, customers\u2019 per-unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting times associated with the announcements. The results of our counterfactual analysis show that it may not be necessary to provide announcements with very fine granularity.

Counterintuitive Escalation of Commitment Results in Real Options Contexts","A robust finding in the escalation literature, termed as the preference effect, is that involvement in the period 1 initial project assessment decision increases the tendency for decision makers to stick with a losing course of action during the period 2 project reassessment decision. The proposed solution is to bring in a new decision maker in period 2. Across multiple studies, we show that providing period 1 information in real options format increases the tendency for decision makers to view period 2 focal event information as both more negative and more important. Consequently, such decision makers exhibit less escalation in period 2, i.e., exhibit behavior opposite to the preference effect. This suggests that, in real option contexts, not only do we not need to bring in a new decision maker, but also (counterintuitively) it is beneficial to retain the same decision maker in situations where escalation is likely to occur.

Whenever a consumer makes a purchase, the firm gives her a link to share with friends, and every purchase coming through that link generates a referral payment. The firm chooses the referral payment function and consumers play an equilibrium in response. The optimal payment function is nonlinear and not necessarily monotonic in the number of successful referrals. If we approximate the optimal policy using a linear payment function, the approximation loss scales with the square root of the average consumer degree. Using a threshold payment, the approximation loss scales proportionally to the average consumer degree. Combining the two, using a linear payment function with a threshold bonus, we can achieve a constant bound on the approximation loss.

When the agent chooses volatility components of the output process and the principal observes the output continuously, the principal can compute the quadratic variation of the output, but not the individual components. This leads to moral hazard with respect to the risk choices of the agent. To find the optimal contract, we develop a novel approach to solving principal\u2013agent problems: first, we identify a family of admissible contracts for which the optimal agent\u2019s action is explicitly characterized; then, we show that we do not lose on generality when finding the optimal contract inside this family, up to integrability conditions. To do this, we use the recent theory of singular changes of measures for It\u00f4 processes. We solve the problem in the case of CARA preferences and show that the optimal contract is linear in these factors: the contractible sources of risk, including the output, the quadratic variation of the output and the cross-variations between the output and the contractible risk sources. Thus, like sample Sharpe ratios used in practice, path-dependent contracts naturally arise when there is moral hazard with respect to risk management. In a numerical example, we show that the loss of efficiency can be significant if the principal does not use the quadratic variation component of the optimal contract.

Our heterogeneous stochastic frontier model allows us to attribute portions of this efficiency to specific characteristics of the stores and categories. Using our full PEM (promotional efficiency frontier) model, we analyze the efficiency of 20 frequently bought categories of a supermarket retailer and apply it to store-category-level data. We find that the average efficiency of category and store sales response across all categories and stores is 84.34%, with low values in categories such as spreads and fresh seafood and high values in categories such as frozen entr\u00e9es and meat. We find that the variation in efficiency of this sales response can be attributed to specific store and category characteristics such as selling area of store, distance to competition, number of stock-keeping units in the category, and average interpurchase time. Unobserved heterogeneity is captured by the latent class approach that provides support for the existence of three segments. An understanding of the roles played by these characteristics in the efficiency of sales response can aid managers in devising a strategy that maximizes sales.

In this paper, we demonstrate that portfolio optimization can be made to work in currency markets. The key difference between the two settings is that in currency markets interest rates provide a predictor of future returns that is free of estimation error, which permits the application of mean-variance analysis. We show that over the last 26 years, a mean-variance efficient portfolio constructed in this fashion has a Sharpe ratio of 0.91, versus only 0.15 for the equally weighted portfolio.

An Empirical Analysis of the Operational Implications of Airline Baggage Fees","In 2008, the majority of U.S. airlines began charging for the second checked bag, and then for the first checked bag. One of the often cited reasons for this action by the airlines\u2019 executives was that this would influence customers to travel with less baggage and thus improve cost and operational performance. A popular customer belief, however, is that airline departure delays got worse due to an increase and size of customer carry-on baggage. A notable exception to the charging for checked bags trend was Southwest Airlines, which turned their resistance to this practice into a \u201cBags Fly Free\u201d marketing campaign. Using a publicly available database of the airlines\u2019 departure performance, we investigate whether the implementation of checked bag fees was really associated with better operational performance metrics. At the aggregate level, using all publicly recorded U.S. flights from May 1, 2007, to May 1, 2009, we find that the airlines that began charging for checked bags saw a significant relative improvement in their on-time departure performance in the time periods after the baggage fees were implemented. Surprisingly, we also find that airlines that did not charge for checked bags also saw an improvement, although not as big, when competing airlines flying the same origin-destination city markets implemented the fees. The improvement in on-time departure performance was the largest for flights during peak evening departure time blocks.

We study the impact of such integration on consumer demand for first-party applications and competing third-party applications by exploring Facebook\u2019s integration of Instagram, an application in its photo-sharing application ecosystem. We find that consumers obtain additional value from Instagram after its integration with Facebook, leading to a large increase in the use of Instagram for Facebook photo sharing. Further, we find that the growth of Instagram\u2019s user base has a positive spillover effect on big third-party applications and a negative spillover effect on small third-party applications in Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing ecosystem. As a result, while small third-party applications face reduced demand after integration, big third-party applications experience a small increase in demand. Thus, the overall demand for the entire photo-sharing application ecosystem actually increases, which suggests that Facebook\u2019s integration strategy benefits the complementary market overall.

In a series of online experiments using a large and diverse but nonrepresentative sample, we compare estimates from the standard methodology of asking sensitive questions to measures from a \u201cveiled\u201d methodology that precludes inference about an individual but provides population estimates. The veiled method increased self-reports of antigay sentiment, particularly in the workplace: respondents were 67% more likely to disapprove of an openly gay manager when asked with a veil, and 71% more likely to say it should be legal to discriminate in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation. The veiled methodology also produces larger estimates of the fraction of the population that identifies as LGBT or has had a sexual experience with a member of the same sex. Self-reports of nonheterosexual identity rose by 65%, and same-sex sexual experiences by 59%. We conduct a \u201cplacebo test\u201d and show that for nonsensitive placebo items, the veiled methodology produces effects that are small in magnitude and not significantly different from zero in seven out of eight items.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of regional and temporal variation in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws on firms\u2019 innovative activities. We find that bankruptcy laws that provide stronger debtor protection decrease the number of patents produced by small firms. Stronger debtor protection also decreases the average quality, and variance in quality, of firms\u2019 patents. We find evidence that the negative effect of stronger debtor protection on experimentation and innovation may be due to the decreased availability of external financing in response to stronger debtor rights, an effect amplified in industries with a high dependence on external financing. Hence, while it is typically assumed that stronger debtor protection encourages innovation by reducing the cost of failure for innovators, we show that it can instead dampen innovative activities by tightening the availability of external financing to innovative firms.

We study the effect of workload during a service episode on gatekeepers\u2019 service configuration decisions and the rate at which gatekeepers refer customers to a specialist. We find that gatekeeper-providers (midwives in our context) make substantial use of two levers to manage their workload (measured as patients per midwife): they ration resource-intensive discretionary services (epidural analgesia) for customers with noncomplex service needs (mothers with spontaneous onset of labor) and, at the same time, increase the rate of specialist referral (physician-led delivery) for customers with complex needs (mothers with pharmacologically induced labor). The workload effect in the study unit is surprisingly large and comparable in size to those for leading clinical risk factors: when workload increases from two standard deviations below to two standard deviations above the mean, noncomplex cases are 28.8% less likely to receive an epidural, leading to a cost reduction of 8.7%, while complex cases are 14.2% more likely to be referred for a physician-led delivery, leading to a cost increase of 2.6%. These observations are consistent with overtreatment at both high and low workload levels, albeit for different types of patients, and suggest that smoothing gatekeeper workload would reduce variability in customer service experience.

PMGs offer consumers the assurance that, should they find a lower price elsewhere within a specified period after purchase the retailer will match that price and refund the price difference. The goal of this study is to explain the following stylized facts: (1) many retailers that operate both online and offline implement PMG offline but not online; (2) the practices of PMG vary considerably across retail categories; and (3) some retailers launch specialized websites that automatically check competitors\u2019 prices for consumers after purchase. To this end, we build a sequential search model that endogenizes consumers\u2019 pre- and postpurchase search decisions. We find that PMG expands retail demand but intensifies price competition on two dimensions. PMG drives retailers to offer deeper promotions because it increases the overall extent of consumer search, which we call the primary competition-intensifying effect. We also find a new secondary competition-intensifying effect, which results from endogenous consumer search. As deeper promotions incentivize consumers to continue price search, retailers are forced to lower the \u201cregular\u201d price to deter consumers from searching. The strength of the secondary competition-intensifying effect increases with the ratio of product valuation to search cost, which explains the variation in PMG practices online versus offline and across retail categories. We show that an asymmetric equilibrium exists such that one retailer offers PMG while the other does not. In this equilibrium, the PMG retailer may benefit from launching a price check website to facilitate consumers\u2019 postpurchase search. This paper was accepted by J.

Taking advantage of limited liability, a debt-financed retailer favors items with a low salvage value, those with a high profit margin, and those that represent a large proportion of the total inventory investment. Second, we argue that this distortion is mitigated when the financing is provided by the supplier who can observe the actual order quantities before determining the credit terms. Borrowing goods rather than borrowing cash limits the retailer\u2019s ability to deviate from the first-best inventory decision. On the flip side, few suppliers can access capital at the same low cost as banks. We study a combination of bank and supplier financing that allows the retailer to get the best of both worlds.

Decomposing order decisions in such a way often follows from organizational structure and can lead to performance improvements compared with ordering directly. However, we also demonstrate that if the critical ratio is below 50%, or if the underlying demand uncertainty is too high, task decomposition may not be preferred to direct ordering. Under such conditions, decision makers are prone to set service levels too high or to suffer from excessive random judgment error, which reduces the efficacy of task decomposition. We further demonstrate that if accompanied by decision support in the form of suggested quantities, task decomposition becomes the better-performing approach to newsvendor decision making more generally. Decision support and task decomposition therefore appear as complementary methods to improve decision performance in the newsvendor context.

We find that relying on satisfaction data masks important time cost sensitivities; namely, it is not how the donor feels about the wait time that matters for return behavior, but rather the actual duration of the wait. Consistent with theory we develop, our results indicate that waiting has a significant longer-term social cost: we estimate that a 38% increase (equivalent to one standard deviation) in the average wait would result in a 10% decrease in donations per year.

We identify early task initiation as a between-stage adaptive response mechanism that occurs when an upstream stage initiates tasks that are normally handled by a downstream stage. We show that having some diagnostic tests ordered during the triage process reduces treatment time by 20 minutes, on average. However, ordering too many tests at triage can lead to an increase in the total number of tests performed on the patient.

Staffing Decisions and Operational Flexibility of Nursing Homes","During the 2000s, over a dozen U.S. states passed laws that prohibit healthcare employers from mandating overtime for nurses. Using a nationwide panel data set from 2004 to 2012, we find that these mandatory overtime laws reduced the service quality of nursing homes, as measured by an increase in deficiency citations. This outcome can be explained by two undesirable changes in the staffing hours of registered nurses: decreased hours of permanent nurses and increased hours of contract nurses per resident day. We observe that the increase in deficiency citations concentrates in the domains of administration and quality of care rather than quality of life, and the severity levels of the increased citations tend to be minor rather than major. We also find that the laws\u2019 negative effect on quality is more severe in nursing homes with higher percentages of Medicare-covered residents.

We test whether customers are affected by such biases when they buy advance tickets for an outdoor movie theater, a real-world situation that, because of the availability of reliable weather forecasts, closely resembles a stylized decision problem under risk. We find that customers\u2019 decisions are heavily influenced by the weather at the time of purchase, even though the latter is irrelevant for the experience of visiting the theater in the future. The empirical evidence cannot be fully explained by a range of candidate rational explanations, but is consistent with the presence of the aforementioned psychological mechanisms.

Although overconfidence has been studied in many contexts, little research examines its progression over long periods of time or in consequential policy domains. This study employs a unique data set from a geopolitical forecasting tournament spanning three years in which thousands of forecasters predicted the outcomes of hundreds of events. We sought to apply insights from research to structure the questions, interactions, and elicitations to improve forecasts. Indeed, forecasters\u2019 confidence roughly matched their accuracy. As information came in, accuracy increased. Confidence increased at approximately the same rate as accuracy, and good calibration persisted. Nevertheless, there was evidence of a small amount of overconfidence (3%), especially on the most confident forecasts. Training helped reduce overconfidence, and team collaboration improved forecast accuracy. Together, teams and training reduced overconfidence to 1%. Our results provide reason for tempered optimism regarding confidence calibration and its development over time in consequential field contexts.

Under conditions that we identify, we show that consumers eventually learn the product\u2019s quality. We show how the learning trajectory can be approximated in settings with high demand intensity via a mean-field approximation that highlights the dynamics of this learning process, its dependence on the price, and the market heterogeneity with respect to quality preferences.

New Evidence from Propensity Score Matching","A large auditing literature concludes that Big N auditors provide higher audit quality than non-Big N auditors. Recently, however, a high-profile study suggests that propensity score matching (PSM) on client characteristics eliminates the Big N effect [Lawrence A, Minutti-Meza M, Zhang P (2011) Can Big 4 versus non-Big 4 differences in audit-quality proxies be attributed to client characteristics?

We conjecture that this finding may be affected by PSM\u2019s sensitivity to its design choices and/or by the validity of the audit quality measures used in the analysis. To investigate, we examine random combinations of PSM design choices that achieve covariate balance, and four commonly used audit quality measures. We find that the majority of these design choices support a Big N effect for most of the audit quality measures. Overall, our findings show that it is premature to suggest that PSM eliminates the Big N effect.

We address the joint problem of determining the panel size of a medical practice and the number of offered appointment slots per day, so that patients do not face long backlogs and the clinic is not overcrowded. We explicitly model the two time scales involved in accessing medical care: appointment delay (order of days, weeks) and clinic delay (order of minutes, hours).

In reality, however, individuals are subject to cognitive limitations and make systematic errors. We leverage established psychology on sample naivete to model individuals\u2019 forecasting errors and biases in a way that is portable to operations models. The model has one behavioral parameter and embeds perfect rationality as a special case. We use the model to mathematically characterize point and error forecast behavior, reflecting an individual\u2019s beliefs about the mean and variance of a random variable. We then derive 10 behavioral phenomena that are inconsistent with perfect rationality assumptions but supported by existing empirical evidence. Finally, we apply the model to two operations settings, inventory management and queuing, to illustrate the model\u2019s portability and discuss its numerous predictions. For inventory management, we characterize order decisions assuming behavioral demand forecasting. The model predicts that even under automated cost optimization, one should expect a pull-to-center effect. It also predicts that this effect can be mitigated by separating point forecasting from error forecasting. For base stock models, it predicts that safety stocks are too small (large) for short (long) lead times. We also express the steady-state behavior of a queue with balking, assuming rational joining decisions but behavioral wait-time forecasts. The model predicts that joining customers tend to be disappointed in their experienced waits. Also, for long (short) lines, it predicts customers have more (less) disperse wait-time beliefs and tend to overestimate (underestimate) the true wait-time variance.

Small claims written under a weak creditor rights regime may be more enforceable than large claims written under a regime with strong creditor protection.

We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in data experiments and apply the model to aggregate search and choice data from the camcorder product category at Amazon.com.

The retailer has superior forecast information about market demand, and the manufacturer builds the capacity and sets the wholesale price prior to demand realization. We explore forecast information sharing between the retailer and the manufacturer by means of cheap talk. We show that meaningful forecast information can be shared truthfully only before the manufacturer sets both the capacity and the wholesale price. By sharing the demand forecast with the manufacturer, the retailer faces the trade-offs between inflating the forecast to convince the manufacturer to increase capacity and deflating the forecast to persuade the manufacturer to offer a lower wholesale price. When the value of forecast information sharing is high, the trade-offs are balanced, and incentives are aligned, leading to truthful information sharing. Moreover, we find that larger demand uncertainty can promote credible information sharing and, surprisingly, can benefit both firms. Finally, we demonstrate that under general distributions, in equilibrium, firms share forecasts as a form of range/interval, which has been also implemented in practice.

A fundamental but largely unanswered question in this nascent industry is the choice of market mechanisms, i.e., how the supply and demand of funds are matched, and the terms (price) at which transactions will occur. Two of the most popular mechanisms are auctions (where the \u201ccrowd\u201d determines the price of the transaction through an auction process) and posted prices (where the platform determines the price). While P2P lending platforms typically use one or the other, there is little systematic research on the implications of such choices for market participants, transaction outcomes, and social welfare. We address this question both theoretically and empirically. We first develop a game-theoretic model that yields empirically testable hypotheses, taking into account the incentive of the platform. We then test these hypotheses by exploiting a regime change from auctions to posted prices on one of the largest P2P lending platforms. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that under platform-mandated posted prices, loans are funded with higher probability, but the preset interest rates are higher than borrowers\u2019 starting interest rates and contract interest rates in auctions. More important, all else equal, loans funded under posted prices are more likely to default, thereby undermining lenders\u2019 returns on investment and their surplus. Although platform-mandated posted prices may be faster in originating loans, auctions that rely on the crowd to discover prices are not necessarily inferior in terms of overall social welfare.

A Robust \u201cMatching Effect\u201d in Policy Evaluation","For a policy to succeed, it must not only be effective in changing behavior but must also be accepted by stakeholders. Here, we report seven sets of studies demonstrating strong framing effects on the acceptance of equivalent policies. Policies targeting desirable voluntary behavior are preferred when they are framed as advantaging those who act desirably (rather than disadvantaging those who do not). Conversely, policies targeting obligations are preferred when they are framed as disadvantaging those who fail to act desirably (rather than advantaging those who do). These differences in policy acceptance do not result from common causes of framing effects, such as a misunderstanding of outcomes or insufficient deliberation about the implications.

We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest.

In the second experiment, subjects may pay to avoid being tested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the more highly feared type 2 (HSV-2).

Their purchase decisions made under such uncertainty may lead to postpurchase regret. It has been experimentally shown that consumers may anticipate their potential postpurchase regret and make their current choices to mitigate or minimize it. That is, a consumer\u2019s anticipated regret can significantly impact his purchase decision. Given the trend that firms in various markets invoke regret to stimulate sales, this paper analytically explores whether and how anticipated regret affects competing firms\u2019 profits and product innovation. Our analyses reveal that the presence of anticipated regret can increase or decrease firms\u2019 profits, and foster or hinder product innovation depending on whether it makes the consumer segments more or less polarized; in other words, anticipated regret has a nonmonotonic effect on firms\u2019 profits and the entrant\u2019s optimal quality. Therefore, anticipated regret may sometimes create a win-win or a lose-lose situation for both firms. Regardless of whether the impact of anticipated regret on firms\u2019 profits is positive or negative, the magnitude of that impact tends to be higher for the low-quality firm.

Our identification of the search model relies on exclusion restriction variables that separate consumer utility and search cost. Because such exclusion restrictions are often available in online click-stream data, the identification and corresponding estimation strategy is generalizable for many online shopping websites where such data can be easily collected. Furthermore, one important feature of online search technology is that it gives consumers the ability to refine search results using tools such as sorting and filtering based on product attributes. The proposed model can integrate consumers\u2019 decisions of search and refinement. The model is instantiated using consumer click-stream data of online hotel bookings provided by a travel website. The results show that refinement tools have significant effects on consumer behavior and market structure. We find that the refinement tools encourage 33% more searches and enhance the utility of purchased products by 17%. Most websites by default rank search results according to their popularity, quality, or relevance to consumers (e.g., Google). When consumers are unaware of such default ranking rules, they may engage in disproportionately more searches using refinement tools. Consequently, overall consumer surplus may deteriorate when total search cost outweighs the enhanced utility. In contrast, if the website simply informs consumers that the default ranking already reflects product popularity, quality, or relevance, consumers search less and their surplus improves. We also find that refinement tools lead to a less concentrated market structure. This paper was accepted by J.

Opacity about contacts between the issuer and rating agencies induces potential asymmetric information about which ratings the issuer obtained. While the equilibrium forces disclosure of ratings when the market knows these have been generated, endogenous uncertainty about whether there are undisclosed ratings can arise and lead to selective disclosure and rating bias.

We assume the demand for each product in each period is characterized by an uncertainty set that depends only on a reference value and the bounds of the demand. Our goal is to find an ordering policy that maximizes the sizes of all the uncertainty sets such that all demand realizations from the sets will result in a total cost lower than a prespecified cost target. We prove that a static decision rule is optimal for an approximate formulation of the problem, which significantly reduces the computation burden. By tuning the cost target, the resultant policy can achieve a balance between the expected cost and the associated cost variance. Numerical experiments suggest that although only limited demand information is used, the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods based on dynamic programming and stochastic programming. More importantly, our approach significantly outperforms the traditional methods if the latter assume inaccurate demand distributions.

The enforcement mechanism underlying an implicit contract is the threat of exclusion: the agent fears that he will lose future income if the principal breaks off the relationship. This threat may be very weak in environments where an agent can appropriate income-generating resources provided by the principal. For example, in credit markets with weak creditor protection, borrowers may be able to appropriate borrowed funds and generate investment income without requiring further loans. We examine implicit contracting in a lending experiment where the threat of exclusion is exogenously varied. We find that weak exclusion undermines implicit contracting: it leads to a more frequent breakdown of credit relationships as well as to smaller loans.

In particular, these plans allow research and development (R&D)-intensive firms to retain and borrow from their employees, which is attractive since they have high adjustment costs, require a stable cash flow, have less collateral, have assets that are harder to value, and have high asymmetric information and agency costs. By contrast, capital expenditures benefit from credit multiplier effects with regard to regular debt, which substitutes for postretirement obligations. As a result, firms with defined-benefit plans have 12% more R&D and 5% less capital expenditure compared with otherwise similar firms, and they vary contributions as a function of cash flow and real investment. The role of postretirement plans is attenuated in countries with available alternative funding sources.

Contrary to the existing theory of mergers developed under deterministic demand, we find that although inventory pooling enables the postmerger firm to achieve cost savings, it always induces firms to raise their prices, and we find that marginal cost reduction induces firms to lower their prices only when it is substantial\u2014consequently, larger cost synergies can benefit even nonparticipant firms.

We show that people make more extreme probability judgments (i.e., closer to 0 or 1) for events they view as entailing more epistemic uncertainty and less aleatory uncertainty. We demonstrate this pattern in a domain where there is agreement concerning the balance of evidence (pairings of teams according to their seed in a basketball tournament) but individual differences in the perception of the epistemicness/aleatoriness of that domain (Study 1), across a range of domains that vary in their perceived epistemicness/aleatoriness (Study 2), in a single judgment task for which we only vary the degree of randomness with which events are selected (Study 3), and when we prime participants to see events as more epistemic or aleatory (Study 4). Decomposition of accuracy scores suggests that the greater judgment extremity of more epistemic events can manifest itself as a trade-off between enhanced resolution and diminished calibration. We further relate our findings to the hard\u2013easy effect and also show that differences between epistemic and aleatory judgment are amplified when judges have more knowledge concerning relevant events.

We show that, in a multifirm setting, insurance can be used strategically as a commitment mechanism to prevent excessive free riding by other firms. In the presence of wealth imbalances, contracts alone leave wealth-constrained firms with inefficiently low incentives to exert effort (because of limited liability) and firms with sufficient wealth with excessive incentives. Insurance allows the latter to credibly commit to lower effort, thereby mitigating the incentives of the wealth-constrained firms to free ride.

We find that working capital levels decrease in the fourth fiscal quarter significantly more than expected, conditional on seasonal changes in economic activity. The decrease subsequently reverses in the following first fiscal quarter. Evidence indicates that firms manage down year-end working capital through transactions that increase year-end operating cash flow and that firms spread this activity over all working capital accounts.

Because service times are uncertain, the aims are to mitigate the unpleasantness experienced by the participants in the system when their waiting times or delays exceed acceptable thresholds and to address fairness in the balancing of service levels among participants. To evaluate uncertain delays, we propose the Delay Unpleasantness Measure, which takes into account the frequency and intensity of delays above a threshold, and introduce the concept of lexicographic min-max fairness to design appointment systems from the perspective of the worst-off participants. We focus our study in the healthcare industry in balancing physicians\u2019 overtime and patients\u2019 waiting times in which patients are distinguished by their service time characterizations.

Our model assumes that people are more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to explain belief synchronization: a strong majority of opinions will likely emerge in favor of one alternative. The reason is that the group is unlikely to move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular. If by chance most people come to dislike alternative A, they are all unlikely to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same. When A is in fact the best alternative, a collective illusion has emerged because people mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best. Our model implies that such a collective illusion is persistent. The model thus offers an existence proof that a collective illusion can occur even in settings where people do not infer that popular alternatives are better.

However, strategic customers may have more incentive to wait if they expect a cost reduction to lead to a price drop. A firm that does not face any uncertainty can use pricing strategies such as price commitment and price matching to alleviate the strategic waiting of customers. However, these pricing strategies provide less flexibility than dynamic pricing for a firm facing uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the impact of cost reduction under dynamic pricing, price commitment, and price matching when cost reduction can come from production learning or from technology advancement. The firm makes pricing decisions when facing uncertainty in future cost, and strategic customers decide whether to wait when facing uncertainty in future price. We show that in general the firm\u2019s profit is higher when future cost is more uncertain, but not necessarily when cost reduction is more significant. In addition, production learning and technology advancement can have opposite effects on the optimal pricing decisions and the choice of pricing strategy.

Even though such bidirectional alliances have become more common, they remain challenging to manage because of the frequent disputes over capacity allocation, especially when demand is uncertain. In this paper, we investigate whether there exists a contractual mechanism that can mitigate the extent of these disputes while improving the profits of all participating firms. We consider two types of bidirectional contracts, namely, the ex post transfer payment contract and the ex ante capacity reservation contract. By modeling the capacity allocation and the bidirectional contract design as a noncooperative game between two firms with noncompeting product lines, we show that, relative to a situation with no contract, either contract can improve the alliance\u2019s total profit in equilibrium. In terms of distribution of the total surplus, we find that capacity reservation contracts always make both firms better off, whereas ex post transfer payment contracts may make one firm worse off. Hence, capacity reservation contracts are more likely to be implemented in practice in such bidirectional alliances.

The model builds on the psychological elements of conceptual consumption, adaptation, and time distance. By virtue of its rich formulation, the AER model produces a wide set of insights and testable predictions, including the U shape of instant utility during anticipation and the optimal duration of anticipation for a given event.

With data from an expert elicitation about climate change catastrophes, we quantify the relative importance of these two effects and calibrate a numerical integrated assessment model of climate change.

Numerical experiments and analysis of the approximations show that increasing case throughput by increasing the probability of case completion can lead to much greater waiting-time reductions than increasing service speed.

Management and Social Performance in the Nike Supply Chain","This study tests the hypothesis that lean manufacturing improves the social performance of manufacturers in emerging markets. We analyze an intervention by Nike, Inc., to promote the adoption of lean manufacturing in its apparel supply chain across 11 developing countries. Using difference-in-differences estimates from a panel of more than 300 factories, we find that lean adoption was associated with a 15 percentage point reduction in noncompliance with labor standards that primarily reflect factory wage and work hour practices. However, we find a null effect on factory health and safety standards. This pattern is consistent with a causal mechanism that links lean to improved social performance through changes in labor relations, rather than improved management systems.

Forecasters were randomly assigned to either prediction markets (continuous double auction markets) in which they were ranked based on earnings, or prediction polls in which they submitted probability judgments, independently or in teams, and were ranked based on Brier scores. In both seasons of the tournament, prices from the prediction market were more accurate than the simple mean of forecasts from prediction polls. However, team prediction polls outperformed prediction markets when forecasts were statistically aggregated using temporal decay, differential weighting based on past performance, and recalibration. The biggest advantage of prediction polls was at the beginning of long-duration questions.

This change is motivated by the appealing theoretical properties of ES as a measure of risk and the poor properties of VaR. In particular, VaR fails to control for \u201ctail risk.\u201d In this transition, the major challenge faced by financial institutions is the unavailability of simple tools for evaluation of ES forecasts (i.e., backtesting ES). The main purpose of this paper is to propose such tools. Specifically, we propose backtests for ES based on cumulative violations, which are the natural analogue of the commonly used backtests for VaR. We establish the asymptotic properties of the tests, and investigate their finite sample performance through some Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application to three major stock indexes shows that VaR is generally unresponsive to extreme events such as those experienced during the recent financial crisis, whereas ES provides a more accurate description of the risk involved.

Selectors simultaneously vote to accept or reject: Unanimous decisions are respected, and candidates with a split decision are hired with probability p. Each candidate arrives with expertise x and y in the two fields, uniformly and independently distributed on [0, 1] and observable to both selectors. If a candidate with expertise pair (x, y) is hired by unanimous decision, the payoffs to the selectors are simply x and y. However, to model the level of conformity in the firm, we deduct a positive \u201cconsensus cost\u201d c from the utility of a selector who has rejected a candidate who is nevertheless hired. We show (Theorem 1) that each stage game has a unique equilibrium in which there are two thresholds, z < v, and say selector I accepts candidate (x, y) if x > v or x > z and y > v. We show that for sufficiently large p and c, decisions are unanimous, and that as the number n of candidates goes to infinity, the equilibrium value of the game goes to the golden mean. We show that as the consensus cost c increases from 0, this hurts the selectors (Theorem 4) but helps the firm (Theorem 6), whose utility from hiring candidate (x, y) is a weighted average of x and y.

This paper investigates how the presence of social learning affects the strategic interaction between a dynamic-pricing monopolist and a forward-looking consumer population, within a simple two-period model. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, we find that the presence of social learning has significant structural implications for optimal pricing policies: In the absence of social learning, decreasing price plans are always preferred by the firm; by contrast, in the presence of social learning we find that (i) if the firm commits to a price path ex ante (preannounced pricing), an increasing price plan is typically announced, whereas (ii) if the firm adjusts price dynamically (responsive pricing), prices are initially low and may either rise or decline over time.

Traditional facility location models for supply chain design focus on the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of proximity, i.e., the distance between facilities and customers. These strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain\u2019s agility, i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In particular, we show that it is optimal to increase the density of distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost parameter increases. Through these findings, our work conveys the message that traditional, proximity-based facility location models can be inadequate for designing modern responsive supply chains, and calls for the need to develop a new class of models for the task.

A robust finding is that a subject\u2019s lack of ability predicts both a true propensity to accept others\u2019 judgment (informational social influence) and a propensity to agree despite private doubt (normative social influence).

However, such a choice is not straightforward because subscription fees typically deter customers, and a resulting decline in viewership further reduces advertising revenues.

One of the justifications of such practice is that an overlapping assortment with competitive prices on the common products may prevent further consumer search and therefore could be useful even when profits from the overlapping products do not justify the costs of carrying them. In this paper, we examine the validity of this intuition and show that such strategy may indeed be optimal when consumers are uncertain about prices they might find elsewhere and face shopping costs for discovery of all prices. Specifically, we show that the (larger) assortment with product overlap may signal a \u201ccompetitive\u201d price of the relatively unique product and prevent further consumer search for a lower price on it. An implication of this finding is that a consumer may rationally behave as if she likes a larger assortment even if the assortment is enlarged by adding products the consumer has no interest in. Furthermore, we show that the optimal pricing strategy may include pricing of common products or products with known costs at a loss, which provides a novel explanation of loss-leader pricing.

Our study reveals a counterintuitive result; the innovator may, under certain conditions, prefer to grant launch control rights or buyout options to the marketer despite the fact that both terms restrict its downstream actions. We demonstrate that a menu of contracts is not necessary to address the adverse selection problem because the menu can be replicated by a single option contract. We show that timing, through renegotiation or delayed contracting, as well as the careful allocation of control rights and options can have a significant influence on the value of collaborative R&D.

High utilization can improve financial performance, but causes congestion, which increases throughput time. Employees may manage this trade-off by reducing processing times during periods of high workload, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between utilization and throughput time. Using two years of inpatient data from 203 California hospitals, we find evidence that patient length of stay (LOS) increases as occupancy increases, until a tipping point, after which patients are discharged early to alleviate congestion. More interestingly, we find a second tipping point\u2014at 93% occupancy\u2014beyond which additional occupancy leads to a longer LOS. These results are indicative of a workload-related \u201csaturation effect\u201d where employees can no longer overcome high workload by speeding up. Our data suggest that the saturation effect is due to an increase in the workload requirements of the remaining patients. Collectively, we find that the underlying relationship between occupancy and LOS is N-shaped. Consequently, managers who seek cost efficiencies via a strategy of high utilization in tandem with speeding up may find that their strategy backfires because there is a point at which employees are no longer able to compensate for a high workload by working harder, and throughput time counterproductively increases. We perform a counterfactual analysis and find that an alternate strategy of employing flexible labor when faced with high occupancy levels might be a more productive approach, and could save the hospitals in our sample up to $138 million over 23 months.

Because of cognitive biases, strategic incentives, or the structure of machine-learning algorithms, these forecasts are often overfit to sample data and are overconfident. Little is known about the challenges associated with aggregating such forecasts. We introduce a theoretical model to examine the combined effect of overfitting and overconfidence on the average forecast. Their combined effect is that the mean and median probability forecasts are poorly calibrated with hit rates of their prediction intervals too high and too low, respectively. Consequently, we prescribe the use of a trimmed average, or trimmed opinion pool, to achieve better calibration. We identify the random forest, a leading machine-learning algorithm that pools hundreds of overfit and overconfident regression trees, as an ideal environment for trimming probabilities. Using several known data sets, we demonstrate that trimmed ensembles can significantly improve the random forest\u2019s predictive accuracy.

Penalties for noncompliance are not specified; rather, they are left to the courts under the legal doctrine of compensatory damages. We analyze three scenarios of increasing uncertainty: full information, where implications of partner actions are known; risk, where implications can be probabilistically quantified; and ambiguity, where implications cannot be so quantified. Under full information, action requirements dominate: they always induce the maximum economic value. This dominance vanishes in the risk scenario. Under ambiguity, deliverables specifications can interact with compensatory damages to create a form of \u201cambiguity insurance,\u201d where ambiguity aversion is assuaged in a way that increases the aggregate, perceived value of the project. This effect does not arise under contracts specifying action requirements. Thus, deliverables contracts may facilitate highly novel joint projects that would otherwise be foregone as a result of excessive uncertainty. Suggested empirical implications include the choice of contract clause type depending on the level of uncertainty in a joint development project, one application being the level of partner experience with interfirm collaborations.

To address endogeneity concerns, I use the introduction of the Big Bang Protocol as a natural experiment. The results suggest that firms with CDSs find it difficult to reduce debt out of court. This is important because it can increase the likelihood of future bankruptcy, which is inefficient. The findings are consistent with the empty creditor hypothesis, which posits that bondholders who are hedged with CDSs are less likely to participate in a debt restructuring. The paper also contains direct evidence for the existence of empty creditors.

We assume that the means and covariance matrix of stochastic demand are known; the distributions are not needed. We derive closed-form ordering quantities for both symmetric and asymmetric uncertainty sets, under capacitated inventory constraints, in both static and dynamic settings. The behaviors of our robust strategies differ qualitatively depending on the symmetry of the uncertainty set. For instance, considering our simplest static problem, (1) if the uncertainty set is symmetric, then there is positive ordering in all periods, whereas (2) if the set is asymmetric, then there is a set of periods in the middle of the planning horizon with zero orders. We also link the symmetry of the uncertainty set to the symmetry of the demand distribution. Finally, we present encouraging computational results where our solution compares favorably to previously studied, more complex robust solutions.

In this paper, we build a microeconomic model of a market that incorporates demand-side innovation and competition. We explain the conditions under which firms find it beneficial to invest in supporting and harvesting users\u2019 innovations, and we show that social welfare rises when firms utilize this source of innovation. Our modeling also indicates reasons for policy interventions with respect to a mixed user and producer innovation economy. From the social welfare perspective, as the share of innovating users in a market increases, profit-maximizing firms tend to switch \u201ctoo late\u201d from a focus on internal research and development to a strategy of also supporting and harvesting user innovations. Underlying this inefficiency are externalities that the producer cannot capture.

When performance targets must be met, attending to observed past performance is not enough to optimize choices\u2014option uncertainty must also be considered. For example, for stretch targets that exceed observed performance, more uncertain options are often better bets. A significant determinant of option uncertainty is sample size: for a given option, the smaller the sample of information we have about it, the greater the uncertainty. In two studies, choices were made between pairs of uncertain options with the goal of exceeding a specified performance target. Information about the options differed in the size of the sample drawn from them, sample size, and the observed performance of those samples, the proportion of successes or \u201chits\u201d in the sample. We found people to be sensitive to sample size\u2013based uncertainty only when differences in observed performance were negligible.

The main arguments are as follow. First, under servicizing the firm charges customers based on the product usage. Second, the quantity of products required to meet customer needs may be smaller because the firm may be able to pool customer needs. Third, the firm may have an incentive to offer products with higher efficiency. Motivated by these arguments, we investigate the economic and environmental potential of servicizing business models. We endogenize the firm\u2019s choice between a pure sales model, a pure servicizing model, and a hybrid model with both sales and servicizing options; the pricing decisions; and the resulting customer usage. We consider two extremes of pooling efficacy, i.e., no pooling versus strong pooling. We find that under no pooling servicizing leads to higher environmental impact due to production but lower environmental impact due to use. In contrast, under strong pooling, when a hybrid business model is more profitable, it is also environmentally superior. However, a pure servicizing model is environmentally inferior for high production costs because it leads to a larger production quantity even under strong pooling. We also examine the product efficiency choice and find that the firm offers higher efficiency products only under servicizing models with strong pooling.

Yet, given the demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, it is surprising that they are often not followed consistently. One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than 50% and where this lack of compliance can result in negative consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our findings suggest that, although individual electronic monitoring can dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained managerial commitment.

Standard behavioral models predict a trade-off in the use of loss contracts: employees will work harder under loss contracts than under gain contracts, but, anticipating loss aversion, they will prefer gain contracts to loss contracts. In a series of experiments, we test these predictions by measuring performance and preferences for payoff-equivalent gain and loss contracts. We find that people indeed work harder under loss than gain contracts, as the theory predicts. Surprisingly, rather than a preference for the gain contract, we find that people actually prefer loss contracts. In exploring mechanisms for our results, we find suggestive evidence that people do anticipate loss aversion but select into loss contracts as a commitment device to improve performance, using one bias, loss aversion, to address another, dynamic inconsistency.

Consequently, managers in these settings often face a trade-off between making an optimal decision and sending a favorable signal. We provide experimental evidence on the choices made by decision makers in such settings. Equilibrium assumptions that are commonly applied to analyze these situations yield the least cost separating outcome as the unique equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the more informed party undertakes a costly signal to resolve the information asymmetry that exists. We provide evidence, however, that participants are much more likely to pursue a pooling outcome when such an outcome is available. This result is important for research and practice because pooling and separating outcomes can yield dramatically different results and have divergent implications. We find evidence that the choice to pool is influenced by changes in the underlying newsvendor model parameters in our setting. In robustness tests, we show that choosing a pooling outcome is especially pronounced among participants who report a high level of understanding of the setting and that participants who pool are rewarded by the less informed party with higher payoffs. Finally, we demonstrate through a reexamination of two previous studies how pooling outcomes can substantively extend the implications of other extant signaling game models in the operations management literature.

After adjusting for the Fama\u2013French three factors and the momentum factor, the abnormal return remains 4.4% per year.

The impact of this information on bidding is likely to be higher when ambiguously specified products are auctioned. The secondary market represents one such environment, where used and returned items from big-box retailers are auctioned off to other business buyers. Using a proprietary data set of secondary market auctions hosted on an online business-to-business platform, we study how market pricing information from other auctions for comparable products affects the bidding behavior of the first bidder. First bidders are shown to be influenced by two sets of pricing information: prices from their own historical bidding behavior and concurrent prices, formed from other open and just-finished auctions relative to the focal auction. We also study how the impact of this market pricing information is moderated by bidder heterogeneity, captured by bidder experience and cross-bidding activity on the platform across comparable concurrent auctions. Finally, we show that the first bid is significantly associated with the auction\u2019s final price, contingent on the type of first bidder. Auctions are increasingly being used for the sale of ill-defined and idiosyncratic products; our work thus provides managerial implications for how auctioneers may design and manage the flow of relevant information to different classes of bidders on their sites in order to enhance their yields.

The new healthcare legislation tests new payment models that remove such incentives, such as the bundled payment (BP) system. We consider a population of patients (beneficiaries). The provider may reject patients based on the patient\u2019s cost profile and selects the treatment intensity based on a risk-averse utility function. Treatment may result in success or failure, where failure means that unforeseen complications require further care. Our interest is in analyzing the effect of different payment schemes on outcomes such as the presence and extent of patient selection, the treatment intensity, the provider\u2019s utility and financial risk, and the total system payoff. Our results confirm that FFS provides incentives for excessive treatment intensity and results in suboptimal system payoff. We show that BP could lead to suboptimal patient selection and treatment levels that may be lower or higher than desirable for the system, with a high level of financial risk for the provider. We also find that the performance of BP is extremely sensitive to the bundled payment value and to the provider\u2019s risk aversion. The performance of both BP and FFS degrades when the provider becomes more risk averse. We design two payment systems, hybrid payment and stop-loss mechanisms, that alleviate the shortcomings of FFS and BP and may induce system optimum decisions in a complementary manner.

A strategy that goes long the quintile portfolio with the highest RNS stocks and short the quintile portfolio with the lowest RNS stocks yields a Fama\u2013French\u2013Carhart alpha of 55 basis points per month (t-statistic of 2.47). The significant underperformance of the portfolio with the most negative RNS stocks is driven by those stocks that are also perceived as relatively overpriced according to a series of overvaluation proxies and are too costly or too risky to sell short, thereby hindering the price correction mechanism. Our findings indicate that a highly negative RNS value, when reflecting high hedging demand for options by investors who perceive the underlying stock as relatively overpriced but hard to sell short, is a robust signal of significant future stock underperformance.

These valuation differences can arise from either differences in earnings estimates or the nonearnings components of valuation methodologies. We find that recommendation changes motivated by earnings estimate revisions have a greater initial price reaction than the same recommendation changes without earnings estimate revisions: about +1.3% (\u22122.8%) greater for upgrades (downgrades). Nevertheless, the postrecommendation drift is also greater, suggesting that investors underreact to earnings-based recommendation changes. Implemented as a trading strategy, earnings-based recommendation changes earn risk-adjusted returns of 3% per month, considerably more than non-earnings-based recommendation changes.

On one hand, financial slack may be spent by managers for their private benefits; a high level is likely associated with severe agency conflicts. Thus corporate governance matters more for high financial slack firms (i.e., the wasteful spending hypothesis). On the other hand, financial slack provides insurance against future uncertainties; a low level may signal deviations from the best interests of shareholders. Then corporate governance is more effective for low financial slack firms (i.e., the precautionary needs hypothesis). We differentiate the two hypotheses using the passage of antitakeover laws to identify exogenous variation in governance. Consistent with the wasteful spending hypothesis, the laws\u2019 passage has a larger negative impact on the operating and stock market performance of high financial slack firms. Further analysis shows that these firms do not invest more but become less efficient at cost management after the laws\u2019 passage.

Although operational transparency has been shown to improve consumer perceptions of service value, existing theory posits that increased contact between consumers and producers may diminish work performance. Two field and two laboratory experiments in food service settings suggest that transparency that (1) allows customers to observe operational processes (process transparency) and (2) allows employees to observe customers (customer transparency) not only improves customer perceptions but also increases service quality and efficiency. The introduction of this transparency contributed to a 22.2% increase in customer-reported quality and reduced throughput times by 19.2%. Laboratory studies revealed that customers who observed process transparency perceived greater employee effort and thus were more appreciative of the employees and valued the service more. Employees who observed customer transparency felt that their work was more appreciated and more impactful and thus were more satisfied with their work and more willing to exert effort. We find that transparency, by visually revealing operating processes to consumers and beneficiaries to producers, generates a positive feedback loop through which value is created for both parties.

Evidence from Syndicated Loan Portfolios","Theory predicts that individual investor\u2019s incentives to uncover new information about asset values are low if asset prices are efficient. This, in turn, implies that heterogeneity in investment manager skill, if present, should be most clearly visible among managers that focus on asset classes with less informationally efficient prices. We investigate this argument using a large sample of syndicated bank loan portfolios managed by collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers. Using a CLO\u2019s equity tranche cash-on-cash return to measure performance, we find strong persistence that is robust to an extensive set of risk controls. Although investors seem to derive their expectation about management quality from a manager\u2019s realized performance and allocate more capital to \u201cskilled\u201d managers, top performers cope to stay ahead of net-of-fees.

This paper studies stock market correlations in an equilibrium model with heterogeneous risk aversion. In the model, preference heterogeneity causes variations in the volatility of aggregate risk aversion from good to bad states. At times of high volatility in aggregate risk aversion, which is a common factor in returns, we see high correlations. The model matches average industry return correlations and changes in correlations from business cycle peaks to troughs and replicates the dynamics of expected excess returns and standard deviations. Model-implied aggregate risk aversion explains average industry correlations, expected excess returns, standard deviations, and turnover volatility in the data.

We find that flexibility in replenishing or liquidating inventory, by providing risk-shifting incentives, could lead to borrowing costs that erase more than one-third of the firm\u2019s value. In this context, we examine the effectiveness of practical and widely used covenants in restoring firm value by limiting such risk-shifting behavior. We find that simple financial covenants can fully restore value for a firm that possesses a midseason inventory liquidation option. In the presence of added flexibility in replenishing or partially liquidating inventory, financial covenants fail, but simple borrowing base covenants successfully restore firm value. Explicitly characterizing optimal covenant tightness for all these cases, we find that better market conditions, such as lower inventory depreciation rate, higher gross margins, or increased product demand, are typically associated with tighter covenants. Our results suggest that inventory-heavy firms can reap the full benefits of additional operating flexibility, irrespective of their leverage, by entering simple debt contracts of the type commonly employed in practice. For such contracts to be effective, however, firms with enhanced flexibility and/or operating in better markets must also be willing to abide by more and/or tighter covenants.

An Empirical Investigation of CMO Compensation and Its Impact on Firm Performance","Despite growing interest in various facets of the position of chief marketing officer (CMO), there is very little research on CMO compensation. Accordingly, we set out to investigate the determinants of CMO compensation and its effect on firm performance. Employing the lens of agency theory, we hypothesize that the CMO\u2019s marginal productivity will positively impact the amount of total compensation as well as the extent of performance-based compensation in the CMO\u2019s compensation contract. Moreover, we hypothesize that deviations in contracting elements from predicted levels will adversely impact firm performance. Analyzing a sample of 9,230 firm-year observations over the period 1992\u20132013, we find that CMOs employed at firms with high advertising and R&D intensity, and operating in competitive product markets, command larger amounts of total compensation. Moreover, a greater proportion of their compensation is market based, with heightened sensitivity to movements in the firm\u2019s stock price. We also find that deviations in CMO compensation elements have an adverse impact on operating performance (return on assets (ROA)), earnings surprises, and stock returns. Specifically, a 10% deviation in market-based compensation from predicted levels reduces ROA by 0.28%, dampens earnings surprises by 0.19%, and degrades annualized stock returns by 2.4%.

Demand response is the capability of power load to react to short-term changes in electricity prices. It plays an increasingly important role in today\u2019s electricity markets but has not been taken into consideration in long-term power generation expansion planning problems, which mostly treat demand as perfectly inelastic. Given mild assumptions for the underlying demand function, the resulting model is a large-scale, concave, linearly constrained maximization problem. We exploit the model structure by developing a new approach to generalized Benders decomposition (GBD). In particular, we present two algorithmic ideas: (1) solving the nonlinear Benders subproblem as a linear programming (LP) problem with the aid of dynamic linear overestimation, referred to as the LP-based method, and (2) directly calculating all necessary optimal primal and dual variable values, referred to as the calculation-based method. We consider three special cases of our expansion planning model and show that solving mathematical programming problems can become entirely obsolete in the calculation-based method. We demonstrate the efficiency of all proposed algorithms for the Texas power system, comparing our tailored decomposition methods to a monolithic approach and a state-of-the-art GBD implementation. Our LP-based method is up to 3,822 times faster than the monolithic approach and up to 55 times faster than the GBD. The calculation-based method dramatically improves the solution time, being an average factor of 20 faster than solving LPs and 107,074 times faster than the monolithic approach (for the largest solvable instance by a commercial solver). The overall largest instance we solve, containing more than 79 million variables and constraints, converges in less than one minute using the calculation-based method.

In practice, customers typically respond to delay announcements by either balking or by becoming more or less impatient, and their response alters system performance. We study the accuracy of the LES announcement in single-class, multiserver Markovian queueing models with announcement-dependent customer behavior. We show that, interestingly, even in this stylized setting, the LES announcement may not always be accurate. This motivates the need to study its accuracy carefully and to determine conditions under which it is accurate. Since the direct analysis of the system with customer response is prohibitively difficult, we focus on many-server, heavy-traffic analysis instead. We consider the quality-and-efficiency-driven and efficiency-driven many-server, heavy-traffic regimes and prove, under both regimes, that the LES prediction is asymptotically accurate if and only if asymptotic fluctuations in the queue length process are small as long as some regulatory conditions apply. This result provides an easy check for the accuracy of LES announcements in practice. We supplement our theoretical results with an extensive simulation study to generate practical managerial insights.

The social interaction thus leads dyads to make shared decisions that follow normative standards more closely than the decisions made by individual decision makers.

We build a stylized model that incorporates (i) customers with ongoing uncertain grocery needs and who choose between shopping offline or online and (ii) an online retailer that makes deliveries through a proprietary distribution network. We find that subscription incentivizes smaller and more frequent grocery orders, which reduces food waste and creates more value for the customer; the result is higher retailer revenues, lower grocery costs, and potentially higher adoption rates. These advantages are countered by greater delivery-related travel and expenses, which are moderated by area geography and routing-related scale economies. Subscription also leads to lower food waste\u2013related emissions but to higher delivery-related emissions. Ceteris paribus, the per-order model is preferable for higher-margin retailers with higher-consumption product assortments that are sold in sparsely populated markets spread over large, irregular areas with high delivery costs. Geographic and demographic data indicate that the subscription model is almost always environmentally preferable because lower food waste emissions dominate higher delivery emissions.

Hostile mediators generate greater willingness to reach agreements between adversaries (Experiment 1). Consequently, negotiators interacting with hostile mediators are better able to reach agreements in incentive-compatible negotiations than those interacting with nice mediators (Experiment 2). By serving as common enemies, hostile mediators cause adversaries in conflict to feel more connected and become more willing to reach agreement (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally, we manipulate the target of mediators\u2019 hostility to document the moderating role of common enemies: mediators who directed their hostility toward both negotiators (bilateral hostility)\u2014becoming a common enemy\u2014increased willingness to reach agreement; those who directed hostility at just one negotiator (unilateral hostility) did not serve as common enemies, eliminating the hostile mediator effect (Experiment 5).

Salient examples of link recommendation include \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d on Facebook and LinkedIn as well as \u201cYou May Know\u201d on Google+. The main stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a new research problem\u2014the utility-based link recommendation problem. We then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods that focus solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the dependency relationship between the value, cost, linkage likelihood, and utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network; predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian network; and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared with prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior research.

Demonstrations may include product samples, trials, return policies, online review platforms, or any other means by which a firm allows consumers to learn about their value for a new product. In our model, demonstrations help individual consumers to learn whether they prefer an innovative product over an established alternative. The innovative firm controls demonstration informativeness. When the innovative firm commits to demonstration policies and there is flexibility in prices, the firm is best off offering fully informative demonstrations that divide the market and dampen price competition. In contrast, when a firm can adjust its demonstration strategy in response to prices, the firm prefers only partially informative demonstrations, designed to maximize its market share. Such a strategy can generate the monopoly profit for the innovative firm. We contrast the strategic role of demonstrations in our framework with the strategic role of capacity limits in models of judo economics, which also allow firms to divide a market and reduce competition.

An increase of one standard deviation in advisor diversification is associated with an announcement return lower by 92 basis points for a bidder acquiring a listed target. The lower bidder returns are attributable to the lower synergies of the deals being completed. Our evidence suggests that internationally diversified advisors offer lower-quality advice to their clients, since their reputational concerns are weakened by having access to multiple geographies from which they can derive fee-based income.

The rules of alliances are important for both the stability of the alliance and the profitability of the alliance members. In this paper, we address the design of resource exchange alliances, a type of alliance agreement widely used in practice, especially in the ocean cargo industry. Resource exchange alliances often increase competition among alliance members since the members can sell substitutable products after the exchange. We propose a resource exchange model that takes into account the resulting competition and alliance profit allocation among alliance members. The problem of determining the optimal amounts of resources to exchange is formulated as a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs). Although MPEC problems are, in general, very difficult to solve, we successfully demonstrate an efficient solution approach and provide valuable insights for the resource exchange design problem. In particular, we show that the resource exchange alliance we propose can induce greater profit for the alliance members (both total and individual profits) even though it leads to greater competition.

Risk is rarely eliminated, because firms trade off costs of management control and expected costs of control loss (together, the \u201ccost of control\u201d). The resultant solution typically comprises a mix of control investments with residual performance and residual relational risks. Transaction cost economics also predicts that the control-residual risk trade-off will vary with the cost of control. We use survey data on 287 risky information technology transactions to test whether the control-residual risk trade-off varies predictably with two partnership-specific factors that proxy for variation in the cost of control: prior ties between exchange partners and the criticality of strategic resources to the transaction. The results support the hypotheses, providing novel evidence on trade-offs that managers make when investing in management controls while also prudently accepting some risks.

Priority queues, in which customers with higher waiting costs are served first, are more efficient but usually involve undesirable queue-jumping behaviors that violate bumped customers\u2019 property rights over their waiting spots. To have the best of both worlds, we propose time-trading mechanisms, in which customers who are privately informed about their waiting costs mutually agree on the ordering in the queue by trading positions. If a customer ever moves back in the queue, she will receive an appropriate monetary compensation. Customers can always decide not to participate in trading and retain their positions as if they are being served FIFO. We design the optimal mechanisms for the social planner, the service provider, and an intermediary who might mediate the trading platform. Both the social planner\u2019s and the service provider\u2019s optimal mechanisms involve a flat admission fee and an auction that implements strict priority. If a revenue-maximizing intermediary operates the trading platform, it should charge a trade participation fee and implement an auction with some trade restrictions. Therefore, customers are not strictly prioritized. However, relative to a FIFO system, the intermediary delivers value to the social planner by improving efficiency, and to the service provider by increasing its revenue.

The purchase price method (PP) requires the acquirer to book the acquisition at historical cost, thereby underestimating the asset value by the amount of the acquirer\u2019s surplus in the transaction. The exit value method (EV) is downward biased and forces the acquirer to book an accounting loss on the date of acquisition. EV connects otherwise independent valuations inducing a reporting-based winner\u2019s curse and can even lead to fire-sale-like values. Relative to PP, EV implies lower asset prices, a decrease (increase) in the surplus of the seller (acquirer), and an increase in the probability that the asset attains its best use when the market is sufficiently competitive. Finally, I examine an alternative method in which the asset is valued at its perceived value-in-use (VU). Under this method, the acquirer bids more aggressively to increase perceived value-in-use, leading to a shift of surplus from the acquirer to the seller. Yet VU is unbiased and always maximizes the probability that the asset attains its best use.

The vast majority of these queueing models ignore the effects of delay experienced by a patient awaiting care. However, long delays may have adverse effects on patient outcomes and can potentially lead to a longer length of stay (LOS) when the patient ultimately does receive care. This work sets out to understand these delay issues from an operational perspective. Using data of more than 57,000 emergency department (ED) visits, we use an instrumental variable approach to empirically measure the impact of delays in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, i.e., ED boarding, on the patient\u2019s ICU LOS for multiple patient types. Capturing these empirically observed effects in a queueing model is challenging because the effect introduces potentially long-range correlations in service and interarrival times. We propose a queueing model that incorporates these measured delay effects and characterizes approximations to the expected work in the system when the service time of a job is adversely impacted by the delay experienced by that job. Our approximation demonstrates an effect of system load on work that grows much faster than the traditional 1/(1 \u2212 \u03c1) relationship seen in most queueing systems. As such, it is imperative that the relationship of delays and LOS be better understood by hospital managers so that they can make capacity decisions that prevent even seemingly moderate delays from causing dire operational consequences.

Targeted email offers featuring products in the same category as a customer\u2019s previous purchases generate higher purchase rates. However, a targeted offer emphasizing familiar products could result in curtailed search for unadvertised products, as a closely matched offer weakens a customer\u2019s incentives to search beyond the targeted items. In a field experiment using email offers sent by an online wine retailer, targeted offers resulted in decreased search activity on the retailer\u2019s website.

The effect over individual customers is, however, unclear: more choice in the future may induce them to postpone a purchase if the current offer is not sufficiently appealing, hoping to buy a better product in the future; moreover, visiting a store to learn about a new product may be costly, thereby diminishing the value of product updates. We analyze a model of strategic customer behavior in the face of a rotating product offering, with variable assortment depth. We find that the customers\u2019 visit and purchase decisions follow a relatively simple structure: a customer should visit the store only when new products have been introduced and purchase a product if the value it provides is higher than a threshold. We then use this structure to examine the retailer\u2019s optimal product-rotation policy. The structure of the optimal policy depends on product-rotation costs and capacity constraints. When capacity constraints are tight, the retailer spreads out product introductions throughout the selling season. Strategic customers tend to become more demanding (their purchasing thresholds increase) as the frequency of product rotation increases, so the marginal benefit of each additional product rotation decreases. In contrast, the purchasing thresholds for myopic customers\u2014who buy the first item that fits their needs\u2014are independent of the number of products introduced in the season. As a result, when the cost of product rotation is low, the frequency of product updates is higher when the retailer sells to strategic customers, whereas the opposite is true when the cost of product rotation is high. When capacity constraints are less stringent and product-rotation costs are convex in the assortment depth, we find that the level of product variety should increase as the season progresses when the firm sells to strategic customers, while the level of product variety stays constant over the season when faced with myopic customers. Finally, when there are no capacity constraints, it is optimal to introduce all products in a single period.

However, most research has studied belief formation in economic and perceptual decision making in isolation. One reason for this separate treatment may be the assumption that there are distinct psychological mechanisms that underlie belief formation in economic and perceptual decisions. An alternative theory is that there exists a common mechanism that governs belief formation in both domains. Here, we test this alternative theory by combining a novel computational modeling technique with two well-known experimental paradigms. We estimate a drift-diffusion model (DDM) and provide an analytical method to decode prior beliefs from DDM parameters. Subjects in our experiment exhibit strong extrapolative beliefs in both paradigms. In line with the common mechanism hypothesis, we find that a single computational model explains belief formation in both tasks and that individual differences in belief formation are correlated across tasks.

Nonmonotonic Price\u2013Quantity Relations in B2B Markets","We study a microprocessor company selling short-life-cycle products to a set of buyers that includes large consumer electronic goods manufacturers. The seller has a limited capacity for each product and negotiates with each buyer for the price. Our analysis of their sales data reveals that larger purchases do not always result in bigger discounts. Instead, the discount curve is like an \u201cN.\u201d While existing theories cannot explain this nonmonotonic pattern, we develop an analytical model and show that the nonmonotonicity is rooted in how sellers value capacity when negotiating with a buyer. Large buyers accelerate the selling process and small buyers are helpful in consuming the residual capacity. However, satisfying midsized buyers may be costly because supplying these buyers can make it difficult to utilize the remaining capacity, which is often too much for small buyers but not enough for large buyers.

Common practice in such systems is to first identify staffing levels and then determine schedules for the servers that cover these levels. We propose a new stochastic integer programming (SIP) model that integrates these two decisions, which can yield lower scheduling costs by exploiting the presence of alternative server configurations that yield similar quality of service. We find that a branch-and-cut algorithm based on Benders decomposition may fail due to the weakness of the relaxation bound. We propose a novel application of mixed-integer rounding to improve the Benders cuts used in this algorithm, a technique that is applicable to any SIP with integer first-stage decision variables.

Given a set of potential facility locations and a set of customers, the goal is to find a subset of facility locations to open and to allocate each customer to open facilities so that the facility opening plus customer allocation costs are minimized. In our setting, for each customer the allocation cost is assumed to be a linear or separable convex quadratic function. Motivated by recent UFL applications in business analytics, we revise approaches that work on a projected decision space and hence are intrinsically more scalable for large-scale input data. Our working hypothesis is that many of the exact (decomposition) approaches that were proposed decades ago and discarded soon after need to be redesigned to take advantage of the new hardware and software technologies. To this end, we \u201cthin out\u201d the classical models from the literature and use (generalized) Benders cuts to replace a huge number of allocation variables by a small number of continuous variables that model the customer allocation cost directly. Our results show that Benders decomposition allows for a significant boost in the performance of a mixed-integer programming solver. We report the optimal solution of a large set of previously unsolved benchmark instances widely used in the available literature. In particular, dramatic speedups are achieved for UFL problems with separable quadratic allocation costs, which turn out to be much easier than their linear counterparts when our approach is used.

The firms\u2019 relative production efficiency, defined as the ratio between their unit cost difference and quality difference, plays a crucial role. With exogenous product qualities, BPD always decreases the profits of the more efficient firm, but increases those of the sufficiently less efficient firm. Anticipating its period 2 disadvantage in price discrimination, the less efficient firm competes more vigorously and also gains more in period 1 than its competitor. For the sufficiently less efficient firm, its period 1 gain dominates its period 2 loss, and its total profits increase. With endogenous quality choices, BPD does not alter the low-end quality (at the lower bound of the quality space), but increases the high-end quality, enlarging quality differentiation. This is because under BPD, each firm\u2019s profit gain decreases (or its profit loss increases) in its relative production efficiency. Interestingly, BPD may increase both firms\u2019 profits under endogenous quality differentiation. Aside from causing mismatch between consumers and products, we further show that BPD lowers social welfare through inducing excessive quality differentiation. This paper was accepted by J.

Innovation in Corporate Finance Research","We study the diffusion of techniques designed to identify causal relationships in corporate finance research.

Consistent with recent theories of technology diffusion, the adoption varies across researchers based on individuals\u2019 expected net benefits of adoption. Younger scholars, holders of PhDs in economics, and those working at top institutions adopt faster. Adoption is accelerated through networks of colleagues and alumni and is also facilitated by straddlers who cross over from economics to finance.

We find strong empirical support for the model. Downside liquidity risk (sensitivity of stock liquidity to negative market returns) has an economically meaningful return premium that is 10 times larger than its symmetric analogue. The expected liquidity level and downside market risk are also associated with meaningful return premiums. Downside liquidity risk and its associated premium are higher during periods of low marketwide liquidity and for stocks that are relatively small, illiquid, volatile, and have high book-to-market ratios. These results are consistent with investors requiring compensation for holding assets susceptible to adverse liquidity phenomena. Our findings suggest that mitigation of downside liquidity risk can lower firms\u2019 cost of capital.

I show that agents using such information can reduce the magnitude of short-lived pricing errors by trading against liquidity shocks. However, the short-run stabilizing effect of this behavior also makes it more difficult to identify liquidity shocks, a signal-jamming effect that slows down price discovery in the long run. As more agents invest in nonfundamental information, market prices become more resilient to liquidity shocks but also recover more slowly from temporary price deviations.

Evidence from 70 Field Experiments","The prevalence and widespread usage of email has given businesses a direct and cost-effective way of providing consumers with targeted discount offers. While these discounts are expected to increase the demand for the promoted products, are they effective in increasing revenues? Do they have effects beyond acting as price reductions? We study these questions using individual-level data from 70 randomized experiments run by a large online ticket resale platform. We estimate the redemption rates of the offers and also measure the broader impact of emailed promotions by comparing purchases by individuals who received the experimental promotions with purchases by those who did not receive the offers because of the experimental randomization. We find that the offers cause the average expenditure to increase significantly, by $3.03 (a 37.2% increase) during the promotion window. However, the redemption rate of these offers is low. Importantly, 90% of these gains are not through redemption of the offers. The individuals who spent more on the platform in the past are more responsive to the offers, and the effect of the offers is significantly higher among individuals who did not transact on the platform in the year before the offer was given. Interestingly, the offer causes carryover to the week after the promotion expires; we find that spending increases by $1.55 in the week after the offer expires. Additionally, we find evidence for cross category spillovers to nonpromoted products: offers not applicable to a ticket genre cause an increase in spending in that genre. We conclude that emailed offers can serve as a form of \u201cadvertising\u201d for the firm\u2019s products, in addition to being tools for price discrimination.

However, translating this seemingly rich data into measures of advertising response has proven difficult, largely because of concerns that advertisers target customers with a higher propensity to buy or increase advertising during periods of peak demand. We show how this problem can be addressed by studying a setting where a firm randomly held out customers from each campaign, creating a sequence of randomized field experiments that mitigates (many) potential endogeneity problems. Exploratory analysis of individual holdout experiments shows positive effects for both email and catalog; however, the estimated effect for any individual campaign is imprecise, because of the small size of the holdout. To pool data across campaigns, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for advertising response that allows us to account for individual differences in purchase propensity and marketing response. Building on the traditional ad-stock framework, we are able to estimate separate decay rates for each advertising medium, allowing us to predict channel-specific short- and long-term effects of advertising and use these predictions to inform marketing strategy. We find that catalogs have substantially longer-lasting impact on customer purchase than emails. We show how the model can be used to score and target individual customers based on their advertising responsiveness, and we find that targeting the most responsive customers increases the predicted returns on advertising by approximately 70% versus traditional recency, frequency, and monetary value\u2013based targeting.

In this study, we identify product variety (measured as the number of factory installed options), plant variety (measured as the number of models per assembly line in a plant), and capacity utilization as drivers of subsequent manufacturing-related recalls. We examine their individual and joint effects using a unique data set compiled for a seven-year period by linking assembly line production data for North American automotive manufacturers with recall data from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. We show that manufacturing-related recalls are positively associated with product variety and plant utilization, but not with plant variety. We also find that the joint effect of plant variety and utilization is positively associated with increased recalls. In quantitative terms, a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of options (four additional options) is associated with two additional recalls and costs $46.2 million to automakers over the sample duration. We observe similar results with plant utilization, and find that a car built in a plant that is being utilized above 100% capacity is associated with more than eight additional recalls corresponding to an incremental cost of $167 million.

The competition\u2013improvement relation between the two levers has important implications for supply base design. We study a buyer facing two potential suppliers that can exert cost-reduction efforts, examining the interplay of supplier competition and supplier cost improvement under various information structures (i.e., the supplier effort is observable or unobservable) and commitment capabilities (i.e., the buyer may not commit, or may commit to a full or partial procurement mechanism, before suppliers exert efforts). We find that the two identical suppliers may choose unequal efforts, resulting in an asymmetric equilibrium outcome that enhances the performance of dual sourcing. Moreover, the competition\u2013improvement relation depends on the effort observability. Whereas supplier competition always leads to lower improvement effort when the effort is unobservable, it may induce higher effort when the effort is observable. Thus, a trade-off between supplier competition and supplier effort is not always necessary in supply base design. Comparing the observable- and unobservable-effort cases, we demonstrate a detrimental effect of supplier effort observability on the buyer profits. Finally, we show that more commitment expands the presence of asymmetric equilibria, enhancing dual sourcing, and the partial commitment strengthens the positive effect of competition on observable efforts while maintaining the detrimental effect of effort observability.

The transmission of market risk premia is the key mechanism through which systemic influences affect the optimal investment strategy.

In this paper, we combine ideas from auction theory and recent work on pricing with strategic consumers to derive the optimal continuous time pricing scheme in this situation. Under the assumption that buyers are split among those who have a high valuation and those who have a low valuation for the item, we obtain the price path that maximizes the seller\u2019s revenue. We conclude that, depending on the specific instance, it is optimal to either use a fixed price strategy or to use steep markdowns by the end of the selling season. As a complement to this optimality result, we prove that under a large family of price functions there is an equilibrium for the buyers. Finally, we derive an approach to tackle the case in which buyers\u2019 valuations follow a general distribution.

Vertical differentiation is innately asymmetric because all customers prefer the higher-quality product when prices are equal. This asymmetry causes BBP to have different properties than symmetric horizontally differentiated models. We highlight two dimensions that affect the analysis: the role of quality-adjusted cost differences between the firms and the role of consumer discounting relative to firm discounting. In the second period, consistent with the prior literature, we find that there are conditions based on market shares and quality-adjusted costs under which either the low-quality firm or the high-quality firm\u2014but not both\u2014will reward its current customers with lower prices than it charges to new customers. We then consider whether these conditions can arise in a two-period equilibrium. We find that if consumers sufficiently discount the future periods, then firms at enough of a competitive disadvantage will reward their customers: i.e., the low-quality firm will reward its current customers if the quality-adjusted cost differential between the two firms is small, while the high-quality firm will reward its current customers if this cost differential is large. Conversely, we find that if consumers do not discount the future very much, then the firm at a competitive disadvantage (i.e., a low-quality firm competing against a low-cost high-quality firm, or a high-quality firm that has very high costs) can earn greater profits with BBP than without BBP, although there are cases where both firms may benefit from BBP.

This bias unequivocally leads to a lower expected profit for a newsvendor that does not compete on inventory availability. Nevertheless, it can be a positive force for competing newsvendors. Indeed, we find that when the product\u2019s profit margin is high, overconfidence can lead to a first-best outcome.

This growing literature focuses on revealing demand patterns of individual assets (e.g., products, stocks, services). However, users typically search many different assets together (e.g., correlated searches) and leave a digital footprint, which can help provide insights on the behaviors of a group of assets. Furthermore, such group behavior can be used to predict outcomes (e.g., demand, stock returns) in the future. We analyze the underlying behavior of distinct subnetworks formed by correlated user searches for multiple items in the stock market and use such information for return prediction. Using cosearch data for stocks from Yahoo! Finance, we find 50\u201379 search clusters representing 230\u2013349 stocks among Russell 3000 stocks at different time periods. These clusters reveal interesting habitats where the returns of stocks within a cluster tend to comove after controlling for known determinants of comovement. When a stock enters (departs) a cluster, the focal stock return comoves (detaches) with the cluster returns. Thus, search cluster\u2013based habitats reveal aggregate investment preferences and are more granular than fundamental-based habitats.

The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer\u2019s optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a \u201cdiamond-shaped\u201d supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk).

This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer\u2019s profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts\u2014in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units\u2014alleviate this coordination problem.

We study the impact of the BOPS initiative on store operations. We build a stylized model where a retailer operates both online and offline channels. Customers strategically make channel choices. The BOPS option affects customer choice in two ways: by providing real-time information about inventory availability and by reducing the hassle cost of shopping. We obtain three findings. First, not all products are well suited for in-store pickup; specifically, it may not be profitable to implement BOPS on products that sell well in stores. Second, BOPS enables retailers to reach new customers, but for existing customers, the shift from online fulfillment to store fulfillment may decrease profit margins when the latter is less cost effective. Finally, in a decentralized retail system where store and online channels are managed separately, BOPS revenue can be shared across channels to alleviate incentive conflicts; it is rarely efficient to allocate all the revenue to a single channel.

To mitigate such risks, companies can invest in screening mechanisms and design incentive schemes in sourcing contracts. Common mitigation instruments include supplier certification, process audits, and contingency payments. The interactions of these instruments are often not well understood. We first note that the effectiveness of any mitigation instrument depends on how it changes the economic trade-offs faced by a supplier in compliance to social and environmental standard, and hence we develop a model that explicitly captures such trade-offs. As a result, our model endogenizes the supplier\u2019s noncompliance probability and connects it with various factors, including the supplier\u2019s intrinsic ethical level that is unobservable to the buyer. We then study the buyer\u2019s optimal contracting problem under different mitigation instruments. We find that although the process audit and contingency payment instruments can directly lower supplier responsibility risk, they, acting alone, are not as effective as the supplier certification instrument in screening suppliers with different ethical levels. Nevertheless, these instruments are all complementary to each other; when used jointly, they make supplier screening more effective and result in lower sourcing cost. These findings provide explanations for some of the observed practices used in industry to mitigate supplier responsibility risks.

We find that attention comovement is nontrivial for the average firm and is related to firm characteristics, such as size and visibility. We also find that the comovement of investor attention has market consequences, in that it is positively associated with excess stock return comovement. Finally, we show that a firm\u2019s earnings announcement contributes to the transfer of attention from one firm to its peer firms.

To do that, we analyze data from a leading U.S. retailer who introduced a \u201cship-to-store\u201d (STS) functionality that allows customers to ship products to their local store free of charge when those products are not available in their local store. Based on the fact that stores prioritize carrying products for which local demand is high, we test the hypothesis that introducing the STS functionality increased the retailer\u2019s overall sales dispersion. We find that, on average, the contribution of the 90% lowest-selling products to total sales increased by 0.75 percentage points, increasing sales dispersion. Calibrating conventional inventory-ordering models, we show that to respond optimally to the observed increase in dispersion, the retailer would need to increase its cycle and safety inventories by approximately 2.7%.

Small Bonuses Can Motivate Ethical Behavior","Although people generally try to avoid lying, the lure of potential monetary payoffs often leads to unethical behavior. The current research investigates whether small monetary rewards for honesty help people resist the temptations of larger incentives or whether they backfire and lead to even more dishonesty. Four experiments address these issues. Experiment 1 shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly when they could have lied to obtain $4; an identical bonus, however, did not increase dishonesty. Experiment 2 uses a different context and again shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly; it also finds no evidence that this small payoff crowded out subsequent altruistic behavior. Experiment 3 shows that a $1 bonus increased people\u2019s honesty even when the payoffs for lying increased to $8, $12, and $16, but not when the payoff for lying increased to $20. Experiment 4 finds that smaller bonuses for honesty still had an impact, although it tended to be somewhat weaker. In addition, compared with no bonus, the combined effect of several small monetary bonuses (1 dollar, 75 cents, 50 cents, and 25 cents) marginally reduced lying.

Under the current allocation policy, the vast majority of deceased organs are allocated locally. This causes significant disparities in waiting times and access to transplant across different geographical areas. To ameliorate this inequity, we propose an operational solution that offers affordable jet services (OrganJet) to patients on the transplant waiting list, allowing them to list in multiple different, and possibly very distant, donation service areas (DSAs) of their choosing. First, using a fluid approximation, we formulate the patients\u2019 problem of choosing a location to multiple list as a selfish routing game in which each patient tries to minimize his \u201ccongestion cost,\u201d i.e., maximize his life expectancy. Through a combination of numerical, simulation, and analytical results, we show that multiple listing can lead to a significant improvement in geographic equity. In the special case when sufficiently many patients can multiple list, the geographic inequity disappears. Moreover, the supply of deceased donor organs increases under multiple listing, leading to more transplants and saved lives. We also consider a diffusion approximation and study the resulting multiple-listing game. The equilibrium outcome under the diffusion approximation is a second-order perturbation of that under the selfish routing formulation. In particular, the geographic equity metric, waiting times, and probabilities of receiving a transplant at various DSAs in equilibrium are second-order perturbations of those predicted by the selfish routing equilibrium. Hence, the analysis under the diffusion approximation also supports the finding that multiple listing leads to an improvement in geographic equity. In addition, restricting attention to the special case of sufficiently many patients multiple listing leads to an explicit characterization of the equilibria, which in turn yields additional structural insights. Last, we undertake a simulation study that supports aforementioned findings.

Network-Based Fraud Detection for Social Security Fraud","We study the impact of network information for social security fraud detection. In a social security system, companies have to pay taxes to the government. This study aims to identify those companies that intentionally go bankrupt to avoid contributing their taxes. We link companies to each other through their shared resources, because some resources are the instigators of fraud. We introduce GOTCHA!, a new approach to define and extract features from a time-weighted network and to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in fraud detection. The GOTCHA! propagation algorithm diffuses fraud through the network, labeling the unknown and anticipating future fraud while simultaneously decaying the importance of past fraud. We find that domain-driven network variables have a significant impact on detecting past and future frauds and improve the baseline by detecting up to 55% additional fraudsters over time.

In this study, we examine differences in the rates of abandonment of medical technologies based on whether abandonment occurs in response to the emergence of a superior technology or in light of new information questioning its efficacy. We link differences in responses to underlying differences in the missions and incentives of organizations. Examining coronary stents across three technological regime changes using a census of approximately two million patients admitted to Florida hospitals from 1995 to 2007, we show meaningful differences across three hospital types: for-profit, not-for-profit, and academic medical centers. Results show that for-profit hospitals abandon the earlier generation in favor of a superior technology faster than not-for-profit hospitals, but this is not the case if the efficacy of the technology is questioned. Academic medical centers, however, have the highest rates of abandonment under both triggers. Importantly, we find that organizational factors dominate physician differences as explanatory factors for abandonment. Implications of these findings are twofold. First, we identify the factors likely at play, i.e., the salience of norms of science and the corresponding trade-offs with economic benefits, when organizations make abandonment decisions. Second, our work underscores the importance of organizational mission, which dominates individual preferences in determining rates of abandonment.

It describes how demand variance amplifies from a downstream site to an upstream site due to demand information distortion. Two different bullwhip effect measures have been used in the literature. Theorists analyze the bullwhip effect based on the information flow (i.e., order and demand information), whereas most empiricists measure it according to the material flow (i.e., shipment and sales data). It is unclear how much the discrepancy between these two measures is, and, if significant, how to reconcile the discrepancy. In this paper, we illustrate and quantify the discrepancy under three inventory systems. For the system with stationary demand and ample supply, we show that the bullwhip effect measure based on the material-flow data is always greater than that based on the information flow. For the system with correlated demand and for the system with supply shortages, we derive conditions under which the material flow measure is either greater or less than the information flow measure. We find that the discrepancy is driven by four factors: stocking level, lead time, demand correlation, and supply service level. We further propose a method to reduce the discrepancy by using the sample variances of aggregated sales data. Our method works for common demand processes with short-range dependence, and it does not require the knowledge of the underlying base-stock levels.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0590","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of the bullwhip effect in supply chains without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures. Using the empirical data obtained from the service provider, we provide statistical evidence that SI is used by its schedulers to manage the macro- and microlevel measures. However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs). We suggest to use threshold-based policies to intelligently combine SI and DSPs and show that the resulting policies provide an efficient way to simultaneously address both macro- and microlevel measures. We build two simulation models: one based on empirical data and one based on a randomly generated open-shop network. We use both models to demonstrate that an open-shop service network can be systematically and effectively managed to deliver improved service level by using SI.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0591","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['healthcare', 'service', 'efficiency']","The article focuses on operational efficiency in a healthcare context, but lacks explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although the leader and the follower cooperate in their component purchase, they compete in selling their end products. We first analyze the most common and simple form of LCB, equal price LCB, under which the follower pays to the leader the same wholesale price that the leader obtains from his negotiation with the supplier. We compare each buyer\u2019s profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader\u2019s and follower\u2019s products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier. We show that fixed price LCB benefits not only the leader but also the follower, compared with separate purchases, which implies that fixed price LCB always achieves a win\u2013win outcome for the buyers.

Information resolves two types of uncertainty: product value uncertainty (i.e., consumers realize valuations when they inspect the product in store, but may end up returning the product when they purchase online) and availability uncertainty (i.e., store visits are futile when consumers encounter stockouts). We consider three information mechanisms: physical showrooms allow consumers to learn valuations anytime they visit the store, even during stockouts; virtual showrooms give consumers online access to an imperfect signal of their valuations; availability information provides real-time information about whether the store has a product in stock. Our main results follow. First, physical showrooms may prompt retailers to reduce store inventory, which increases availability risk and discourages store patronage. Second, virtual showrooms may increase online returns and hurt profits, if they induce excessive customer migration from store to online channels. Third, availability information may be redundant when availability risk is low and may render physical showrooms ineffective when implemented jointly. Finally, when customers are homogeneous, these mechanisms may not exhibit significant complementarities and the optimal information structure may involve choosing only one of the three.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0593","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of omnichannel retailing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients\u2019 waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients\u2019 waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician\u2019s decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust.

Inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized, whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized. Both types of generators compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator, who solves a two-stage stochastic program to determine the production level for each generator and the corresponding market prices. We aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators\u2019 (in)flexibility and renewable energy\u2019s intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system. The policy of economically curtailing intermittent generation intensifies the market competition, reduces price volatility, and improves the system\u2019s overall efficiency. Furthermore, these benefits of economic curtailment are most significant when the production-based subsidies for renewable energy are absent.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0595","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['renewable energy', 'market competition', 'policy']","While the article discusses renewable energy and its impact on market competition, it primarily focuses on technical aspects and economic efficiency rather than social justice or equity themes.

We develop a model of premium room and standby upgrade pricing under an uncertain market size and examine how and when standby upgrades can provide additional revenue for a hotel. When guests are myopic, we show that standby upgrades can be used as a powerful price discrimination tool, especially for hotel properties with high premium-to-standard room ratios.

Such teams operate for a limited time, after which they dissolve and some of their members may work together again as part of another team.

We highlight the role of nuanced team composition dynamics beyond average team familiarity. We observe that teams with high dispersion of pairwise familiarity exhibit lower team productivity, and the existence of a \u201cbottleneck-pair\u201d may significantly hinder overall knowledge transfer capability, thus, productivity of fluid teams. In addition, we find that the higher the percentage of familiarity gained from complex tasks, the higher the productivity of the team.

The model is applied to the German secondary reserve market using actual driving patterns and market data. Our results indicate that contract parameters influence EVs\u2019 value to aggregators in surprising ways, partially contradicting findings in previous literature. In essence, high levels of plug-in durations or low levels of guaranteed driving for planned trips do not necessarily provide the highest profit.

At the beginning of every summer, a fine wine distributor has to choose between purchasing bottled wine made from the harvest collected two years ago and wine futures of wine still aging in the barrel from the previous year\u2019s harvest. At the end of the summer, after seeing weather and market fluctuations, the distributor can adjust its allocation by trading futures and bottles. This paper makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model to determine the optimal selection of bottled wine and wine futures under weather and market uncertainty. Our model is built on an empirical foundation in which the functional forms describing the evolution of futures and bottle prices are derived from comprehensive data associated with the most influential Bordeaux winemakers. Second, we develop structural properties of optimal decisions. We show that a wine distributor should always invest in wine futures because it increases the expected profit in spite of being a riskier asset than bottled wine. We characterize the influence of variation in various uncertainties in the problem. Third, our study empirically demonstrates for a large distributor the financial benefits of using our model. The hypothetical average profit improvement in our numerical analysis is significant, exceeding 21%, and its value becomes higher under risk aversion. The analysis is beneficial for fine wine distributors, as it provides insights into how to improve their selection in order to make financially healthier allocations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0602","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on financial decision-making and risk management in wine distribution without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Examples of such settings are numerous and include those where limits are placed on the use of scarce natural resources as input or on the amount of waste or harmful pollution generated by production as output.

We provide an effective approximate solution approach that can compute these thresholds efficiently while retaining their essential properties. We examine the differences between how an allowance constraint and a constraint on production capacity affect production decisions and show that they exhibit opposite effects over time. We also examine, in the context of an extended version of the problem where both the allowance amount and the production capacity are endogenous, optimal investments in allowance and production capacity and the impact of both on firm profit.

Although the structure of most programs is the same, there is no clear dominant strategy for the type of vehicles that should be provided through car sharing. In this paper, we consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that contemplates car sharing and designs its product line by accounting for the trade-off between driving performance and fuel efficiency under CAFE standards. Customers have different valuations of driving performance and decide whether to buy, join car sharing or rely on their outside options. We find that the OEM increases the fuel efficiency of the vehicles it provides through car sharing. This higher efficiency enables the OEM to charge a higher selling price to the higher end of the market, thus increasing its profit. This is especially beneficial to higher-end OEMs that face greater cannibalization and can explain why Daimler and BMW have been particularly active in introducing car sharing. Offering car sharing is not always environmentally beneficial. Even when it is, we find that doing so may reduce the OEM\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) level. In such cases, incentive multipliers should be granted for each shared car. Finally, if anticipating aggressive CAFE standards, OEMs may introduce car sharing to better absorb the increase in the production cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0605","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['car sharing', 'fuel efficiency', 'environmentally beneficial']","The article discusses car sharing and fuel efficiency, which touch on environmental considerations but primarily focus on business strategy and profitability.

Customers in each class are inherently heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for service, but their utilities are also affected by the presence of other customers in the system. Specifically, customer utilities depend on how many customers are in the system at the time of service as well as who these other customers are. We find that if the service provider can price discriminate between customer classes, pricing out a class, i.e., operating an exclusive system, can sometimes be optimal and depends only on classes\u2019 perceptions of each other. If the provider must charge a single price, an exclusive system is even more likely. We extend our analysis to a service provider who can prevent class interaction by allocating separate capacity segments to the two customer classes. Under price discrimination, allocating capacity is optimal if the \u201cnet appreciation\u201d between classes, as defined in the paper, is negative. However, under a single-price policy, allocating capacity can be optimal even if this net appreciation is positive.

Information sharing allows a manufacturer\u2019s wholesale price to respond to demand signal, which benefits the supply chain if the manufacturer is efficient in cost reduction and hurts it otherwise. It also allows a manufacturer\u2019s cost reduction level to respond to demand signal, which always benefits the supply chain. A supply chain that engages in information sharing triggers a reaction from the rival chain. Such a reaction may benefit or hurt the first supply chain, depending on whether the retailers compete on quantity or price, and whether or not the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. With quantity competition, information sharing occurs when the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when either information is less accurate or competition is less intense. With price competition, information sharing occurs when either competition is intense or the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when information is more accurate. When information sharing is beneficial to a supply chain, a manufacturer can buy information from a retailer with a side payment, which is zero if the manufacturer is sufficiently efficient in cost reduction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0607","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2017","19","2","Heikki PeuraHeikki Peurah.peura@imperial.ac.ukImperial College Business School, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author, S.

Prior research has focused on how trade credit benefits firms by improving vertical supply chain relationships. This paper offers a novel perspective by examining whether trade credit benefits suppliers through a horizontal channel. Under the classic Bertrand competition framework, we analyze two competing firms\u2019 price decisions with and without trade credit. We find that when the firms are financially constrained, trade credit softens horizontal price competition. Specifically, with trade credit, the firms will behave less aggressively in setting their prices for fear of incurring additional financing costs, resulting in equilibrium prices above the marginal cost, even if the products are perfect substitutes. Equilibrium profits under trade credit may thus be strictly higher than those under cash contracts. Furthermore, we find that with trade credit, a financially stronger firm may be able to exclude its weaker competitor from the market. We also investigate the relationship between the firms\u2019 financial strength and their physical capacity in the competition with trade credit. We find that the horizontal benefit of trade credit over cash contracts increases as either the firms\u2019 physical capacities increase or their financial status weakens. Therefore, with trade credit, firms\u2019 financial constraints are a partial substitute for the role that physical capacity plays in price competition. Finally, we study the firms\u2019 choice between offering trade credit and cash contracts. We find that trade credit is the equilibrium contract form if customers value trade credit, suggesting that the horizontal benefit of trade credit may complement its vertical roles.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0608","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of trade credit and its impact on competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our problem formulation corresponds to the typical markdown management decisions in a retail chain. The solution methodology determines the optimal combinations of three important operational levers\u2014pricing, inventory allocation, and store consolidation. Inventory dependence causes the optimal price trajectory to decrease over time as the current on-hand inventory decreases. The optimal inventory allocation shifts more inventory to the larger stores as the inventory effect becomes stronger. Solution methodologies are also developed for the case of optimal constant prices, which leads to the same optimal inventory allocations. If all stores have the same seasonal variations and the inventory is allocated optimally, then all stores have identical price trajectories. Optimal consolidation of the inventory to a subset of the stores is also determined. Consolidation of inventory to a subset of stores can be beneficial even when there are no fixed costs of stocking a store. Using some typical parameter values for retail items, our calculations show that significant benefits can result from taking the inventory effect into account in pricing, inventory allocation, and store consolidation decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0609","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2017","19","2","Maria C.

In the transportation domain, car-sharing models are being adopted on a mass scale in major metropolitan areas worldwide. This mode of servicized mobility bridges the resource efficiency of public transit and the flexibility of personal transportation. Beyond the significant potential to reduce car ownership, car sharing shows promise in supporting the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs), because of these vehicles\u2019 special cost structure with high purchase but low operating costs. Recently, key players in the car-sharing business, such as Autolib\u2019, car2go, and DriveNow, have begun to employ EVs in an operations model that accommodates one-way trips. On the one hand (and particularly in free-floating car sharing), the one-way model results in significant improvements in coverage of travel needs and therefore in adoption potential compared with the conventional round-trip-only model (advocated by Zipcar, for example). On the other hand, this model poses tremendous planning and operational challenges. In this work, we study the planning problem faced by service providers in designing a geographical service region in which to operate the service. This decision entails trade-offs between maximizing customer catchment by covering travel needs and controlling fleet operation costs. We develop a mathematical programming model that incorporates details of both customer adoption behavior and fleet management (including EV repositioning and charging) under imbalanced travel patterns. To address inherent planning uncertainty with regard to adoption patterns, we employ a distributionally robust optimization framework that informs robust decisions to overcome possible ambiguity (or lacking) of data. Mathematically, the problem can be approximated by a mixed integer second-order cone program, which is computationally tractable with practical scale data. Applying this approach to the case of car2go\u2019s service with real operations data, we address a number of planning questions and suggest that there is potential for the future development of this service.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0611","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['collaborative consumption', 'resource efficiency', 'fuel-efficient vehicles', 'electric vehicles']","The article discusses collaborative consumption and the efficient use of resources, which align with sustainability themes.

In this paper, we provide a novel explanation and investigate the role of consumer bounded rationality in the sense of anecdotal reasoning. We adopt a simple model that allows us to isolate the role of customer bounded rationality on using posterior price matching. We demonstrate that while it is never optimal to adopt posterior price matching when consumers have rational expectations, it can be optimal when they have boundedly rational expectations. We show when and how a seller can intentionally mark down with some probability and adopt price matching to make a profit. Ignoring customer bounded rationality can result in a significant profit loss. Then, we build a dynamic programming model to investigate how the firm should dynamically manage its markdowns over the long run. We show that a cyclic policy switching between a high and low markdown probability is typically optimal for exploiting customer bounded rationality. We characterize the nature of the cyclic policy and the range in which it is optimal. Our findings underscore the importance of consumer bounded rationality and provide managerial and practical guidelines on how to manage price matching when customers are boundedly rational.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0612","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The manufacturer decides on the amount of its market expansion advertising investment in the first period and on its pricing strategy in both periods. Advertising increases the \u201csize of the pie,\u201d but eventually the manufacturer may end up inadvertently sharing the benefits with the copycat. After the first period, the copycat makes a market-entry decision, and, if it opts to enter, it also decides on a pricing strategy. The customers are strategic, and they decide whether or not to buy, when to buy, and which product to buy. We find that, interestingly, lower quality levels of the manufacturer\u2019s product may increase the manufacturer\u2019s prices and profit. Moreover, the manufacturer may be worseoff when customers are more likely to purchase its product immediately rather than wait for a price reduction or for the copycat\u2019s product. Finally, the copycat may be worseoff when customers withhold their purchases in the first period in anticipation of the possibility of copycat product becoming available in a later period.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0613","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a game theoretical model related to market strategies and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical, or DEI themes.

The supply chains that support online retailing are fundamentally different from those that support traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Traditional solutions are not always appropriate to solve online retailing\u2019s operations problems; thus, there is an opportunity to understand and improve these novel supply chains. One key characteristic of the inventory systems for online retailing is demand spillover, whereby a stockout at a fulfillment center (FC) results in demand spilling over to another FC. For this context we examine how to allocate inventory to the FCs under a periodic-review joint-replenishment policy, with an objective to minimize outbound shipping costs for a fixed amount of inventory. We first show how traditional decentralized allocation policies may perform suboptimally and induce dynamics (whiplash) that result in costly spillover. We find that this phenomenon increases with the prevalence of local stockouts and with the level of inventory imbalance. We then describe that inventory imbalance occurs in online retailing because of operational realities and provide evidence based on real data. Finally, we propose a heuristic to allocate inventory accounting for possible spillover during the lead time. We test the heuristic by a simulation and show that it performs better than the status quo policy, is robust to operational realities, and captures over 90% of the possible improvement as compared to a pseudo-optimal policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0614","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management in online retailing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a \u201csurge pricing\u201d policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform\u2019s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0618","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['welfare', 'concerns', 'stakeholders']","The article discusses concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers, indicating a moderate awareness of social implications related to surge pricing.

We perform three laboratory studies and analyze how decisions are affected by the metric used to indicate inventory performance.

The second study analyzes a decision maker who must decide on the effort to invest in optimizing inventory of a specific product. The third study corresponds to the economic order quantity model. Our behavioral models suggest that decisions are affected by the metric that is used to indicate performance, and we find support for the predictions in laboratory experiments with human subjects: Under the inventory turn rate metric, individuals overvalue inventory reductions.

With reference to existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts\u2014the vertically integrated electricity supplier, market competition, and partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity\u2014and examine the effect of carbon taxes on the cost and share of wind capacity in an energy portfolio. We find that the intermittency of renewable technologies drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms, which suggests that charging more for emissions could unexpectedly discourage investment in renewables. We also show that market liberalization may reduce investment in renewable capacity while increasing the overall system\u2019s cost and emissions. Fixed-price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but not without possibly creating other problems. In short, actions to reduce the intermittency of renewable sources may be more effective than carbon taxes alone at promoting investment in renewable generation capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0621","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['renewable', 'carbon emissions', 'investment', 'sustainability']","The article discusses renewable energy and carbon emissions, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and environmental ethics.

Major goals of private nonindustrial forest owners are to achieve a steady flow of profits while reaching an overall satisfactory and reliable profit level. These goals are pursued under uncertainties in the growth of trees in different regions and in the prices of wood products. We propose an optimization framework that uses financial risk concepts to capture the above goals and uncertainties, and apply it to a real forestry problem in Finland. Our results demonstrate that the obtained harvesting schedules outperform those obtained without the explicit consideration of the stability and reliability requirements in harvest profits. More generally, our results indicate that the forest owner can improve the profit stability by (i) harvesting a greater number of forest stands early and (ii) harvesting in the first periods of the planning horizon stands that are predominantly composed of slow-growing forests. This research responds to the call for scenario-based approaches that represent well, and in a solvable way, multiple uncertainties in large forestry problems.

In turn, such waiting lowers the firm\u2019s profitability and increases the firm\u2019s bankruptcy risk. Using a two-period model to capture these dynamics, this paper identifies customers' strategic waiting behavior as a source of a firm\u2019s cost of financial distress. We also find that customers' anticipation of bankruptcy can be self-fulfilling: when customers anticipate a high bankruptcy probability, they prefer to delay their purchases, making the firm more likely to go bankrupt than when customers anticipate a low probability of bankruptcy. Such behavior has important operational and financial implications. First, the firm acts more conservatively when facing either more severe financial distress or a large share of strategic customers. As its financial situation deteriorates, the firm lowers inventory alone when financial distress is mild or only a small share of customers are strategic and lowers both inventory and price in the presence of severe financial distress and a large fraction of strategic customers. Under optimal price and inventory decisions, strategic waiting accounts for a large part of the firm\u2019s total cost of financial distress, although a larger proportion of strategic customers may result in a lower probability of bankruptcy. In addition to inventory reduction and (immediate) price discount, we find that a deferred discount, in the form of rebates and/or store credits for future purchases, can act as an effective mechanism to mitigate strategic waiting. As a contingent price reduction, deferred discounts align the interests of customers and the firm and are most effective when the fraction of strategic customers is high and the firm\u2019s financial distress is at a medium level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0634","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on financial distress and customer behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In some settings (\u201cvertical\u201d) the coproducts differ along a performance dimension and are substitutable. In other settings (\u201chorizontal\u201d) the coproducts differ in their applications and are not substitutable. In both cases, three important attributes of a coproduct technology are its processing cost, overall yield, and coproduct split, i.e., the proportion of each output produced. For both vertical and horizontal settings with deterministic market sizes, we characterize the optimal pricing and production decisions of a monopoly firm with two technologies. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for dual activation (i.e., using both technologies) to be optimal. Dual activation is driven by differences in marginal costs across the two technologies. There is an additional motive for dual activation in the horizontal setting: the desire to generate a product mix that better resembles the market mix. Building on the optimal production analysis, we characterize the optimal adoption-and-usage strategy of a firm with one incumbent technology considering a new technology. We establish the conditions for which a new technology will displace the incumbent or be used with the incumbent, and highlight some important adoption and usage differences between vertical and horizontal settings. Results are extended to the setting with uncertain market size(s).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0637","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of coproduct technologies and market strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Cox regression analysis reveals that in this call center, callers\u2019 abandonment behavior is affected by the announcement messages heard. To account for this, we formulate a structural estimation model of callers\u2019 (endogenous) abandonment decisions. In this model, callers are forward-looking utility maximizers and make their abandonment decisions by solving an optimal stopping problem. Each caller receives a reward from service and incurs a linear cost of waiting. The reward and per-period waiting cost constitute the structural parameters that we estimate from the data of callers\u2019 abandonment decisions as well as the announcement messages heard. The call center performance is modeled by a Markovian approximation. The main methodological contribution is the definition of an equilibrium in steady state as one where callers\u2019 expectation of their waiting time, which affects their (rational) abandonment behavior, matches their actual waiting time in the call center, as well as the characterization of such an equilibrium as the solution of a set of nonlinear equations. A counterfactual analysis shows that callers react to longer delay announcements by abandoning earlier, that less patient callers as characterized by their reward and cost parameters react more to delay announcements, and that congestion in the call center at the time of the call affects caller reactions to delay announcements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1542","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of call center performance and abandonment behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In reality, however, marketers do not precisely know how the customer population will respond and can only obtain an estimate of the choice model from limited conjoint data. In this paper, we propose a new type of optimization approach for product line design under uncertainty. Our approach is based on the paradigm of robust optimization where, rather than optimizing the expected revenue with respect to a single model, one optimizes the worst-case expected revenue with respect to an uncertainty set of models. This framework allows us to account for parameter uncertainty, when we may be confident about the type of model structure but not about the values of the parameters, and structural uncertainty, when we may not even be confident about the right model structure to use to describe the customer population. Through computational experiments with a real conjoint data set, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in addressing parameter and structural uncertainty. With regard to parameter uncertainty, we show that product lines designed without accounting for parameter uncertainty are fragile and can experience worst-case revenue losses as high as 23%, and that the robust product line can significantly outperform the nominal product line in the worst case, with relative improvements of up to 14%. With regard to structural uncertainty, we similarly show that product lines that are designed for a single model structure can be highly suboptimal under other structures (worst-case losses of up to 37%), while a product line that optimizes against the worst of a set of structurally distinct models can outperform single model product lines by as much as 55% in the worst case and can guarantee good aggregate performance over structurally distinct models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1546","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on optimization techniques in product line design without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Customers\u2019 types differ along two dimensions: (i) their willingness-to-pay for the product and (ii) their arrival time during the selling season. We assume that the seller knows only the support of the customers\u2019 valuations and do not make any other distributional assumptions about customers\u2019 willingness-to-pay or arrival times. We consider a robust formulation of the seller\u2019s pricing problem that is based on the minimization of her worst-case regret. We consider two distinct cases of customers\u2019 purchasing behavior: myopic and strategic customers. For both of these cases, we characterize optimal price paths. For myopic customers, the regret is determined by the price at a critical time. Depending on the problem parameters, this critical time will be either the end of the selling season or it will be a time that equalizes the worst-case regret generated by undercharging customers and the worst-case regret generated by customers waiting for the price to fall. The optimal pricing strategy is not unique except at the critical time. For strategic consumers, we develop a robust mechanism design approach to compute an optimal policy. Depending on the problem parameters, the optimal policy might lead some consumers to wait until the end of the selling season and might price others out of the market. Under strategic customers, the optimal price equalizes the regrets generated by different customer types that arrive at the beginning of the selling season. We show that a seller that does not know if the customers are myopic should price as if they are strategic. We also show there is no benefit under myopic consumers to having a selling season longer than a certain uniform bound, but that the same is not true with strategic consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1548","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical pricing problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We then show that using measures from these two families may inadvertently provide incentives for either pessimism or optimism among forecasters, i.e., rewarding underforecasts or overforecasts relative to some reference measure of central tendency. As an illustration of these concepts, we examine the use of these measures for model selection in a forecast aggregation example using stock price forecasts derived from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers\u2019 Estimate System. This example illustrates how aggregation methods that always yield lower estimates relative to the mean or median generally exhibit better scores using percentage error-based measures, while those that yield higher estimates compared to the mean or median will effectively rank higher when relative error-based measures are used.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1550","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of forecast accuracy measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem we study is faced by an Internet advertising firm (Chitika) that operates in the Boston area. Chitika contracts with publishers to place relevant advertisements (ads) over a specified period on publisher websites. Ad revenue accrues to the firm and the publisher only if a visitor clicks on an ad (i.e., we are considering the cost-per-click model in this study). This might imply that all visitors to the publisher\u2019s website be shown ads. However, this is not the case if the publisher imposes a click-through-rate constraint on the advertising firm. This performance constraint captures the publisher\u2019s desire to limit ad clutter on the website and hold the advertising firm responsible for the publisher\u2019s opportunity cost of showing an ad that did not result in a click. We develop a predictive model of a visitor clicking on a given ad. Using this prediction of the probability of a click, we develop a decision model that uses a threshold to decide whether or not to show an ad to the visitor. The decision model\u2019s objective is to maximize the advertising firm\u2019s revenue subject to a click-through-rate constraint. A key contribution of this paper is to characterize the structure of the optimal solution. We study and contrast two competing solutions: (1) a static solution, and (2) a rolling-horizon solution that resolves the problem at certain points in the planning horizon. The static solution is shown to be optimal when accurate information on the input parameters to the problem is known. However, when the parameters to the model can only be estimated with some error, the rolling-horizon solution can perform better than the static solution. When using the rolling-horizon solution, it becomes important to choose the appropriate resolving frequency. The implemented models operate in real time in Chitika\u2019s advertising network. Implementation challenges and the business impact of our solution are discussed. To present a head-to-head comparison of our implemented approach with the past practice at Chitika, we implemented our solution in parallel to the past practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1553","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internet advertising and revenue optimization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

An important cause of this deficit, particularly in the developing world, is the high fare evasion rate mainly due to an ineffective control policy or the lack of it. In this paper we study new models for optimizing fare inspection strategies in transit networks based on bilevel programming. In the first level, the leader (the network operator) determines probabilities for inspecting passengers at different locations, while in the second level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing their routes given the inspection probabilities and travel times. To model the followers\u2019 behavior we study both a nonadaptive variant, in which passengers select a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an adaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to update their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own right, we design exact and approximation algorithms, and we prove a tight bound of 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies. For the leader\u2019s optimization problem, we study a fixed-fare and a flexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the operator\u2019s will. For the latter variant, we design an LP-based approximation algorithm. Finally, employing a local search procedure that shifts inspection probabilities within an initially determined support set, we perform an extensive computational study for all variants of the problem on instances of the Dutch railway and the Amsterdam subway network. This study reveals that our solutions are within 5% of theoretical upper bounds drawn from the LP relaxation. We also derive exact nonlinear programming formulations for all variants of the leader\u2019s problem and use them to obtain exact solutions for small instance sizes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1560","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['fare evasion', 'public transit', 'subsidies']","The article primarily focuses on optimizing fare inspection strategies and does not engage with social justice or equity themes.

The capacity adjustment is costly and often subject to managerial hurdles, which sometimes make it difficult to adjust capacity multiple times. To clearly analyze the impact of demand learning on the firm\u2019s decision, we study two scenarios. In the first scenario, the firm\u2019s capacity adjustment cost increases significantly with respect to the number of adjustments because of significant managerial hurdles, and resultantly the firm has a single opportunity to adjust capacity (single adjustment scenario). In the second scenario, the capacity adjustment cost does not change with respect to the number of adjustments because of little managerial hurdles, and therefore the firm has multiple opportunities to adjust capacity (multiple adjustment scenario). For both scenarios, we first formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program, and then characterize the firm\u2019s optimal policy: when to adjust and by how much. We show that the optimal decision on when and by how much to change the capacity is not monotone in the likelihood of high demand in the single adjustment scenario, while the optimal decision is monotone under mild conditions, and the optimal policy is a control band policy in the multiple adjustment scenario. The sharp contrast reflects the impact of demand learning on the firm\u2019s optimal capacity decision. Since computing and implementing the optimal policy is not tractable for general problems, we develop a data-driven heuristic for each scenario. In the single adjustment scenario, we show that a two-step heuristic, which explores demand for an appropriately chosen length of time and adjusts the capacity based on the observed demand is asymptotically optimal, and show the convergence rate. In the multiple adjustment scenario, we also show that a multistep heuristic under which the firm adjusts its capacity at a predetermined set of periods with an exponentially increasing gap between two consecutive decisions is asymptotically optimal and shows its convergence rate. We finally apply our heuristics to a numerical study and demonstrate the performance and robustness of the heuristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1561","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity investment and demand learning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is the problem of a traveler in a railway system who plans to take the fastest route to a destination but is faced with a disruption of unknown length on this route. In that case, he can wait until the disruption is over or take a detour route as an alternative. Since the duration of the disruption is not known in advance, he is left with a decision problem under uncertainty. In this paper we model the problem and describe the strategies that may be used in such a situation. Instead of finding optimal strategies for a specialized quality measure, we consider dominance relations between strategies and show that dominated strategies are nonoptimal for the common quality measures. We then analyze which strategies for the TRCP are dominated. In general, the set of nondominated strategies is strongly reduced. We also show that, under certain assumptions, only a small set of strategies is nondominated and conclude that in this case the TRCP can be solved by enumeration for any of the quality measures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1564","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to route choice under uncertainty without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The call center must determine the staffing level together with a prioritization rule that meets these targets at minimal cost. In practice, because of the underlying complexity of these systems, the prioritization rule is often selected in a heuristic manner rather than being systematically optimized.

Requiring an inspection of a patient\u2019s \u201creadiness for discharge\u201d introduces an interesting dynamic where patients may occupy a bed longer than medically necessary. Motivated by this phenomenon, we introduce a queueing system with time-varying arrival rates in which servers who have completed service cannot be released until an inspection occurs. We examine how such a dynamic impacts common system measures such as stability, expected number of customers in the system, probability of waiting, and expected waiting time. Leveraging insights from an infinite-server model, we\u2019re able to optimize the timing of inspections and find via theoretical and numerical analysis that (1) optimizing a single inspection time could lead to significant improvements in system performance when the amplitude of the arrival rate function is large, (2) multiple inspections should be uniformly distributed throughout the day, and (3) the marginal improvements of adding additional inspection times is decreasing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1536","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of queueing systems in healthcare without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Course allocation is one common application of combinatorial allocation, in which the bundles are schedules of courses and the assignees are students. Existing mechanisms used in practice have been shown to have serious flaws, which lead to allocations that are inefficient, unfair, or both. A recently developed mechanism is attractive in theory but has several features that limit its feasibility for practice. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a new course allocation mechanism, Course Match, that is suitable in practice. To find allocations, Course Match performs a massive parallel heuristic search that solves billions of mixed-integer programs to output an approximate competitive equilibrium in a fake-money economy for courses. Quantitative summary statistics for two semesters of full-scale use at a large business school (the Wharton School of Business, which has about 1,700 students and up to 350 courses in each semester) demonstrate that Course Match is both fair and efficient, a finding reinforced by student surveys showing large gains in satisfaction and perceived fairness.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1544","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['fairness', 'inefficient', 'unfair', 'satisfaction']","The article discusses issues of fairness and efficiency in course allocation, indicating a moderate focus on equitable outcomes.

Such trade-offs are prone to behavioral anomalies by which human decision makers deviate from the discounted expected utility model. We build an axiomatic preference model that accounts for three well-known anomalies and produces a parsimonious generalization of discounted expected utility. We then plug this behavioral model into a Stackelberg-Nash game between a firm that decides the price discount and a continuum of consumers who decide to wait or buy, anticipating other consumers\u2019 decisions and the resultant likelihood of product availability. We solve the markdown management problem and contrast the results of our model with those under discounted expected utility. We analytically show that accounting for the behavioral anomalies can result in larger markdowns and higher revenue.

In particular, for the square root function, the approximation ratio is 4/5. We also propose a 1.25-approximation algorithm for a class of minimization problems in which the maximization of the utility function appears as a subproblem. Although the worst-case bounds are tight, computational experiments indicate that the suggested approach finds solutions within 1%\u20132% optimality gap for most of the instances, and can be considerably faster than the existing alternatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1570","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any mention of social themes, diversity, ethics, or social justice.

We find that interdependency between demand streams plays a critical role in determining the existence and magnitude of the bullwhip effect. Specifically, we consider two operating environments: (a) The firm orders product-specific materials so that the ordering decision is based on the product level; and (b) the firm orders generic materials so that the order decision is based on the category level.

This paper considers the problem of planning sales promotions for an FMCG product in a grocery retail setting. The category manager has to solve the promotion optimization problem (POP) for each product, i.e., how to select a posted price for each period in a finite horizon so as to maximize the retailer\u2019s profit. Through our collaboration with Oracle Retail, we developed an optimization formulation for the POP that can be used by category managers in a grocery environment. Our formulation incorporates business rules that are relevant, in practice. We propose general classes of demand functions (including multiplicative and additive), which incorporate the post-promotion dip effect, and can be estimated from sales data. In general, the POP formulation has a nonlinear objective and is NP-hard. We then propose a linear integer programming (IP) approximation of the POP. We show that the IP has an integral feasible region, and hence can be solved efficiently as a linear program (LP). We develop performance guarantees for the profit of the LP solution relative to the optimal profit. Using sales data from a grocery retailer, we first show that our demand models can be estimated with high accuracy, and then demonstrate that using the LP promotion schedule could potentially increase the profit by 3%, with a potential profit increase of 5% if some business constraints were to be relaxed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1573","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of promotion planning and optimization in the FMCG industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While extant literature either assumes a winner-take-all scheme a priori or shows its optimality under specific distributions for uncertainty, this paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the winner-take-all scheme is optimal. These conditions are violated when agents perceive it very likely that only few agents receive high evaluation or when a tournament does not require substantial increase in agents\u2019 marginal cost of effort to develop high-quality solutions. Yet, the winner-take-all scheme is optimal in many practical situations, especially when agents have symmetric beliefs about their evaluation.

We prove that the formulation yields price bounded price distortions, and we show that adding a similar penalty term to transmission flows and phase angles ensures boundedness throughout the network. We prove that when the price distortions are zero, day-ahead quantities equal a quantile of their real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of price distortions suggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over deterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements.

Nontrivial statistical and implementation issues arise when designing R&S procedures for a parallel computing environment. We propose several design principles for parallel R&S procedures that preserve statistical validity and maximize core utilization, especially when large numbers of alternatives or cores are involved. These principles are followed closely by our parallel Good Selection Procedure (GSP), which, under the assumption of normally distributed output, (i) guarantees to select a system in the indifference zone with high probability, (ii) in tests on up to 1,024 parallel cores runs efficiently, and (iii) in an example uses smaller sample sizes compared to existing parallel procedures, particularly for large problems (over 106 alternatives). In our computational study we discuss three methods for implementing GSP on parallel computers, namely the Message-Passing Interface (MPI), Hadoop MapReduce, and Spark, and show that Spark provides a good compromise between the efficiency of MPI and robustness to core failures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1577","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of ranking and selection procedures in computing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, due to recent advancements in communication technology, various services now make this kind of information accessible to customers at a reasonable cost. In our model, which reflects this new opportunity, customers choose among three options: join the queue, balk, or inspect the queue length before deciding whether to join. Inspection is associated with a cost. We compute the equilibrium in this model and prove its existence and uniqueness. Based on two normalized parameters\u2014congestion and service valuation\u2014we map all possible input parameter sets into three scenarios. Each scenario is characterized by a different impact of inspection cost on equilibrium and revenue-maximization queue disclosure policy: fully observable (when inspection cost is very low), fully unobservable (when inspection cost is too high), or observable by demand (when inspection cost is at an intermediate level). We show that when maximizing social welfare, the optimal disclosure policy is zero inspection cost. We show the structure remains the same when a fraction of the customers are considered urgent, that is, they always join, whereas the others are nonurgent and therefore join according to their equilibrium strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1578","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['social welfare', 'equilibrium', 'cost']","The article discusses 'social welfare' as a key outcome, indicating a consideration of societal impact alongside traditional business metrics like revenue.

To address this problem, we study a minimum cost multicommodity network design model to select arcs and route the required flows along these arcs so that each origin-to-destination route satisfies limits on various service metrics. To effectively solve this service network design problem, we focus on a polyhedral approach to strengthen its arc flow formulation.

We characterize the dimension of the problem\u2019s feasible region and show that two classes of inequalities are facet-defining under appropriate conditions.

The rivalry is modeled through a network, an arc between a pair of buyers indicates that a buyer considers another buyer its rival, and the magnitude of the loss is the private information of each buyer. This loss-exposure due to competitive considerations can be viewed as a negative externality. First, using a Myersonian approach we derive the monopolist\u2019s optimal mechanism for any given network. Second, we show that revenues depend on the network structure. Thus, in applications where it is possible, the monopolist might consider designing not only the mechanism but also the network (if not fully, at least partially). Third, we provide and fully describe the solution to the monopolist\u2019s market design problem; that is, the joint network and mechanism design problem. Specifically, despite the nonmonotone impact of additional competition on the monopolist\u2019s revenues, we determine revenue-maximizing rivalry networks (which in turn induce optimal mechanisms) and show that they are independent of distributional assumptions on buyers\u2019 independent private loss values, provided virtual values are bounded from zero. We achieve these results under different restrictions on the network structure and formation. When rivalry is symmetric, matchings are optimal (with at most one path on three vertices). Thus, a market with a fragmented network structure yields higher revenues for the monopolist than a market with a completely connected network structure. However, asymmetric competitive relationships among buyers generate higher revenues than symmetric ones. The optimal asymmetric networks are characterized by (i) every buyer having at least one rival and (ii) the existence of a buyer not considered a rival by anyone.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1585","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of market design and revenue maximization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

One practical implication of this question lies in whether or not full-truckload (FTL) shipping is optimal if customer demand is in integral number of truckloads. In this paper, we investigate the integrality question in single-product, multiechelon distribution systems and show that integrality holds under deterministic demand but fails to hold under stochastic demand. In distribution systems with stochastic demand, less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping can be significantly cheaper than the cost of the optimal FTL shipping policy, even in the presence of economies of scale. For instance, this occurs in settings where shipping costs are expected to increase in the future and/or inventories are more expensive to hold upstream than downstream. In such situations, our results highlight the importance of strategically positioning inventory: LTL shipments can offer a more balanced allocation of inventory across the distribution network, leading to benefits that can exceed the savings from FTL shipments due to economies of scale. However, when the cost parameters are fairly constant across time and inventory holding costs are not significantly higher upstream than downstream, then the difference between the costs of optimal FTL and optimal LTL shipping is provably marginal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1586","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control and optimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose a novel branch-and-price algorithm for this challenging problem. Using real-world network topologies, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to both test the performance of the proposed solution methodology and evaluate the practical benefits of flexible optical networks.

To evaluate them, we use a rule from the general class of proper scoring rules for a forecaster\u2019s multiple quantiles of a single uncertain quantity of interest. The general rule is additive in the component scores. Each component contains a function that measures its quantile\u2019s distance from the realization and weights its contribution to the overall score. To determine this function, we propose that the score of a group\u2019s combined quantile should be better than that of a randomly selected forecaster\u2019s quantile only when the forecasters bracket the realization (i.e., their quantiles do not fall on the same side of the realization).

Currently, a UAV is remotely controlled by a ground station through frequent data communications, which make the current system vulnerable in a threat environment. We propose a decentralized control strategy while requiring UAVs to maintain radio silence during the entire mission. The strategy is analyzed based on a scenario where a fleet of vehicles is assigned to search and collect uncertain information in a set of regions within a given mission time. We demonstrate that a region-sharing strategy is beneficial even when there is no extra reward gained from additional information collection. Implementing a region-sharing strategy requires solving a decentralized time allocation problem, which is computationally intractable. To overcome this, an approximate formulation is developed under an independence assumption for information collected by different vehicles. This approximate formulation allows us to decompose, by vehicle, the time allocation problem, and obtain an easily implementable policy that takes on a Markovian form. We develop a sufficient condition under which the approximate formulation becomes exact. A numerical study establishes the computational efficiency of the method; only a few CPU seconds are needed for problems with a planning horizon of 300 time units and 40 regions. We further present a case study to illustrate region-sharing behaviors among UAVs while using practical parameter values. Finally, we compare the obtained policy with the optimal policy found using a complete enumeration method for small instances. Under different parameter settings, the average optimality gap ranges from 0.23% to 19.90%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1590","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of unmanned aerial vehicles and their operational efficiency in a military context, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Numerical studies show that, with the decomposition technique, the kernel smoothing approach works well for a reasonably large portfolio with 200 risk factors.

Redundancy has been shown to produce significant response time improvements in applications ranging from organ transplant waitlists to Google\u2019s BigTable service.

Our problem formulation includes practical considerations like fixed costs and multiperiod inventory considerations but is challenging to analyze directly. Instead, we take a bounding approach that isolates the novel aspect of our problem: the impact of test inventory allocation on demand learning. We specifically examine a trade-off between the quantity of stores tested and the quality of observations, which can be impacted by demand censoring due to inventory stockouts. We find that the visibility into the timing of each sales transaction has a pivotal impact on the allocation decisions that optimize learning. When such timing information is unobservable, the retailer may need to consolidate inventory in few stores to increase service levels during the test and thereby to minimize the negative impacts of demand censoring. When sales timing information is observable, the retailer optimizes learning by maximizing the number of sales during the test period without regard to stockouts in individual stores. In a numerical study, we show that heuristics motivated by our analyses are near optimal and that inefficient allocations can considerably reduce the learning value of the merchandise test. We also examine the interplay between the retailer\u2019s learning incentive and the natural incentives brought by fixed costs and profits earned during the test itself. We find that it is sufficient for the retailer to consider only the learning incentive when the main selling period is relatively long compared with the testing period.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1596","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory allocation and demand learning without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

For example, demand for equipment that plants or harvests corn correlates with the corn price on the commodity market, and discount stores experienced increased sales revenue during the last recession. Thus, we model demand as a stochastic process with two components: in addition to the usual Gaussian component reflecting demand volatility, there is a drift component taking the form of a function of a tradable asset price. (In the case of dependence on the general economy, the asset price can be a broad market index, such as the S&P 500 Index.) With this demand model, we study the one-time production quantity decision along with a real-time risk-hedging strategy over a given planning horizon (the production cycle). Pursuing a mean-variance formulation, we derive the optimal solution to both production and hedging decisions. We give a complete characterization of the efficient frontier and quantify the improvement in risk-return trade-off achieved by the hedging strategy. Furthermore, we show that the hedging strategy is self-financing in the sense that the expected total wealth from both production and hedging stays nonnegative at all times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1597","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and risk management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Existing solution methods obtain a sequence of policies that converges to optimality in value but may not improve monotonically, ie., a policy in the sequence may be worse than preceding policies. Our proposed approach considers countably-infinite linear programming (CILP) formulations of the MDPs (a CILP is defined as a linear program (LP) with countably-infinite numbers of variables and constraints). Under standard assumptions for analyzing MDPs with countably-infinite state spaces and unbounded rewards, we extend the major theoretical extreme point and duality results to the resulting CILPs. Under additional mild assumptions, which are satisfied by several applications of interest, we present a simplex-type algorithm that is implementable in the sense that each of its iterations requires only a finite amount of data and computation. We show that the algorithm finds a sequence of policies that improves monotonically and converges to optimality in value.

In this model, the benefit of the technology is uncertain and, in each period, the decision maker (DM) may adopt the technology, reject the technology, or pay to acquire a signal about the benefit of the technology. The dynamic programming state variables are the DM\u2019s wealth and a probability distribution that describes the DM\u2019s beliefs about the benefit of the technology; these distributions are updated over time using Bayes\u2019 rule. If the signal-generating process satisfies the monotone-likelihood ratio property and the DM is risk neutral, the value functions and policies satisfy natural monotonicity properties: a likelihood-ratio improvement in the distribution on benefits leads to an increase in the value function and moves the DM away from rejection and toward adoption. With risk aversion, the value functions (now representing expected utilities) will be monotonic, but the policies need not be monotonic, even with reasonable utility functions. However, if we assume the DM exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and is not \u201ctoo risk averse,\u201d the policies can be shown to be monotonic.

Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market. Recently, an alternative so-called stochastic settlement market has been proposed (see, e.g., Pritchard et al. 2010 [Pritchard G, Zakeri G, Philpott A (2010) A single-settlement, energy-only electric power market for unpredictable and intermittent participants.

The PCL model allows for choice-correlation and, like the NL model, includes the MNL model as a special case. Compared to the NL models, the PCL model does not restrict the sequence of the choice structure and allows for different covariances among all pairs of choices. This additional flexibility in structure enables a more accurate representation of some choice settings and broadens its empirical applications. Hence, it is of both theoretical and practical interests to extend the normative studies on the MNL and NL models to the PCL model and examine the pricing problem under this model. Due to cross-nesting of choice alternatives, the pricing problem under the PCL model poses a greater challenge than the MNL and NL models. However, using the concept of P-matrix, we are able to identify conditions for a unique optimal price solution and develop an efficient and theoretically sound approach for finding the optimal prices. We show that the analysis and solution approach are generalizable to other GEV family models with cross-nested alternatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1614","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price optimization using the paired combinatorial logit model without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our goal is to simplify the computational complexity by resorting to certain approximation techniques, and, in doing so, to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. First, we perform a derivative analysis of the problem\u2019s optimality equations and develop general, analytical solution bounds for the optimal policy. This leads to simple-to-compute near-optimal heuristic solutions, which also reveal an intuitive relationship with the primitive model parameters. Second, we establish an MMD central limit theorem under long replenishment lead time through asymptotic analysis. We show that the relative errors between our heuristic and the optimal solutions converge to zero as the lead time becomes sufficiently long, with the rate of convergence being the square root of the lead time. Third, we show that, by leveraging the Laplace transform, the computational complexity of our heuristic is superior to the existing methods. Finally, we provide the first set of numerical study for serial systems under MMD. The numerical results demonstrate that our heuristic achieves near-optimal performance even under short lead times and outperforms alternative heuristics in the literature. In addition, we observe that, in an optimally run supply chain under MMD, the internal fill rate can be high and the demand variability propagating upstream can be dampened, both different from the system behaviors under stationary demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1615","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control and computational complexity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The shipments arriving earlier in the market may sell at higher prices, but faster shipping services can be costly. In this paper, we study a newsvendor-type shipper who transports and sells seasonal products to an overseas market, where the selling price declines over time. A set of vessels with different schedules and freight rates are available to choose from. Our analysis demonstrates that a portfolio of vessels has two distinct effects on mitigating uncertainties in both demand and vessels\u2019 arrival schedules, while these two portfolio effects have been previously understood as separate issues in the literature. To find the optimal portfolio in our problem, we first show that when vessels arrive in a deterministic sequence, the optimal portfolio can either be derived in closed form (in the single-demand setting), or computed efficiently with a variation of the shortest-path algorithm (in the multi-demand setting). Then, based on these results, we propose an approximation procedure to address the general problem with an uncertain arrival sequence. In each iteration of the procedure, we only need to minimize a cost function approximated by a deterministic arrival schedule, and the portfolio generated can converge to the optimal one under mild conditions. Finally, we present a real-world case study to demonstrate several practical implications of managing a carrier portfolio.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1616","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of shipping management and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our starting point is that the latter phenomena can be used to support the control of queue lengths and delays. We do so by timing the announcements appropriately and determining the staffing levels accordingly. To this end, we model a service system as an overloaded GI/M/s + GI queue, in which we seek to minimize the number of servers, s, subject to quality-of-service constraints (e.g., fraction abandoning), while accounting for the instantaneous (hence discontinuous) impact of an announcement on the distribution (hazard rate) of customer patience. For tractability, our analysis is asymptotic as s increases indefinitely, and it is naturally efficiency-driven (namely the servers are highly busy, and hence essentially all customers are delayed in queue prior to service). This requires one to go beyond existing theory, which turns out to be too crude for our needs (e.g., it requires a continuous hazard rate of impatience and hence cannot be applied). We thus develop a refined process and steady-state models, and use them to solve our minimization problem and more. The value and accuracy of our models are demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1619","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The two supply options differ in their costs and lead times. For the system under the joint commitment, the optimal policy has a simple structure and can be fully characterized by three critical numbers in each period. For the system under the separate commitments, we show that the optimal order quantities in each period are monotonic in the starting inventory and the remaining commitments with bounded sensitivity. Moreover, we establish convergence results on the optimal order quantities when the committed quantity from either supply approaches infinity. These findings highlight the effects of order commitments on the optimal inventory policies. On the basis of these results, we develop a simple heuristic for the system under separate commitments and show numerically that it performs very well. The numerical study further shows that the firm could incur a considerable loss if it ignores or overemphasizes the order commitments when managing its inventory. Finally, we conduct numerical analysis to derive insights into the firm\u2019s supply contract selection in the presence of minimum order commitments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1622","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2017","65","5","Marcus AngMarcus Angmarcusang@smu.edu.sgLee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, 178899, SingaporeSearch for more papers by this author, Karl SigmanKarl Sigmanksigman@columbia.eduFu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author, Jing-Sheng Song \n                    Corresponding Author\n                Jing-Sheng Songjssong@duke.eduhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-8908-2302Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author, Hanqin ZhangHanqin Zhangbizzhq@nus.edu.sgNUS Business School, National University of Singapore, 119245, SingaporeSearch for more papers by this author","Closed-Form Approximations for Optimal (r, q) and (S, T) Policies in a Parallel Processing Environment","We consider a single-item continuous-review (r, q) inventory system with a renewal demand process and independent, identically distributed stochastic lead times.

These reformulations can greatly simplify solutions of the information relaxations, both in leading to finite horizon subproblems and by reducing the number of states that need to be considered in these subproblems. We show that any reformulation leads to a lower bound on the optimal cost of the DP when used with an information relaxation and a penalty built from a broad class of approximate value functions. We refer to this class of approximate value functions as subsolutions, and this includes approximate value functions based on Lagrangian relaxations as well as those based on approximate linear programs. We show that the information relaxation approach, in theory, recovers a tight lower bound using any reformulation and is guaranteed to improve on the lower bounds from subsolutions. Finally, we apply information relaxations to an inventory control application with an autoregressive demand process, as well as dynamic service allocation in a multiclass queue. In our examples, we find that the information relaxation lower bounds are easy to calculate and are very close to the expected cost using simple heuristic policies, thereby showing that these heuristic policies are nearly optimal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1631","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic dynamic programming without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Interestingly, our result shows that a small increase in the transaction cost at one end of the chain can be greatly amplified and shifts the system away from the steady state.

The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. We develop a data-driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality. We validate and implement this model as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This system effectively incorporates the flexibility in the resources and uncertainty in surgical durations, and explicitly trades off resource usage and overtime costs. This has increased the average daily utilization of the anesthesiologists by 3.5% and of the operating rooms by 3.8%.

On the one hand, consumers discount the face value of a mail-in rebate, making it less effective than an instant discount in inducing consumers\u2019 purchase. On the other hand, a portion of consumers with mail-in rebates fail to redeem them, resulting in savings for the retailer. We study how retailers, under pressure to move inventory, should use these two pricing tools to maximize revenue by determining the optimal use of mail-in rebates together with dynamic pricing of limited inventory. In a base model that allows frequent adjustment of product price and rebate face value, the optimal policy takes the form of \u201cdiscount only,\u201d \u201crebate only,\u201d or a combination of the two. For useful heuristics with infrequent policy adjustment, we analyze the deterministic approximation of the base model. Interestingly, the deterministic solution splits the selling season into two segments, and it suggests using different pricing-rebate policies in each segment. Finally, we study a scenario in which the retailer has only one opportunity to introduce a static rebate, and we find that for any inventory level there is a cutoff time before which rebates should not be used. Our numerical studies show that such an optimal one-time static rebate policy performs well compared with the optimal revenue in the benchmark model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1642","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of pricing strategies and revenue maximization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

This paper describes an alternative based on the computation of worst-case bounds under the geometric premise of tail convexity, a feature shared by all common parametric tail distributions. We characterize the optimality structure of the resulting optimization problem, and demonstrate that the worst-case convex tail behavior is in a sense either extremely light tailed or extremely heavy tailed.

In this model, the joint setup cost incurred by a group of retailers placing an order simultaneously consists of a group-independent major setup cost and retailer-specific minor setup costs. The goal is to determine an inventory replenishment policy that minimizes the long-run average system-wide cost. In this paper, we adopt a noncooperative approach to study the joint replenishment game. We consider the allocation rule in which the major setup cost is split equally among the retailers who place an order together, and each retailer pays his own holding and minor setup costs. Given the preannounced allocation rule, each retailer determines his replenishment policy to minimize his own cost anticipating the other retailers\u2019 strategy. We show that a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium exists, and quantify the efficiency loss of the noncooperative outcome relative to the social optimum.

Yet most countries in sub-Saharan Africa experience significant delays in diagnosis because of operational inefficiencies in early infant diagnosis (EID) networks. We develop a two-part modeling framework relying on optimization and simulation to generate operational improvements in the assignment of clinics to laboratories and the allocation of capacity across laboratories, and to evaluate the associated impact on the number of infants initiating treatment. Applying our methodology to EID program data from Mozambique, we validate our simulation model and estimate that optimally reassigning clinics to labs would decrease the average sample turnaround time (TAT) by 11% and increase the number of infected infants starting treatment by about 4% relative to the current system. Furthermore, consolidating all diagnostic capacity in one centralized lab would decrease average TATs by an estimated 22% and increase the number of infected infants initiating treatment by 7%. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the consolidation of capacity in a single location would remain near optimal across a wide range of laboratory utilization levels in Mozambique. However, this full consolidation solution is dominated by configurations with two or more labs for EID networks with average transportation times larger than those currently observed in Mozambique by at least 15%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1646","","OR","Multidisciplinary","7","['HIV', 'infants', 'treatment', 'diagnosis', 'operational improvements']","The article addresses critical health issues affecting marginalized populations in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on improving access to healthcare for HIV-infected infants.

Yet, the expectations of exchange partners can, and routinely do, differ with respect to the goals, preferences, and vulnerabilities in their shared relationship. To account for such differences in expectations, we propose a broadened conceptualization of the sources of interorganizational trust as dyadic. Viewing the sources of trust as dyadic expands the conventional focus on mutual elements to further emphasize exclusive features of an exchange relationship. To substantiate our theory, we examine a key source of interorganizational trust, exchange hazards, and assess the extent to which its effects vary as a function of (1) the locus of exchange hazards (own versus other) in the dyad, (2) the degree of power imbalance in the dyad, and (3) each party\u2019s power position in the dyad. To assess the validity of our claims, we devise a matched dyad research design and collect identical information from both buyers and suppliers in a given exchange relationship. Based on our results, we make three unique observations consistent with the notion of dyadic sources of trust. First, the same exchange hazards have contrasting effects on trust (enhancing versus diminishing) across the dyad. Second, the degree of power imbalance has opposing effects across the dyad.

While the sorting and incentive effects that result may increase productivity, the social comparison processes that arise may dampen it. We posit that the mechanisms underlying these behavioral costs are shaped not only by the magnitude of reward variance, but by the formal and informal design elements shaping the distance of advantaged peers. In other words, the more proximate socially, structurally, or geographically are those to whom one socially compares, the larger the behavioral response. Empirically, we use an unanticipated event during which outlets of a bank, previously operating under essentially homogenous incentives, were assigned to tournament groups with differing ex ante probabilities of winning a prize\u2014an event that increases variance in awards and hence generates an impetus for social comparison.

Horizontal comparison also appears to reduce pay\u2013performance sensitivity, in accord with prior theory proposing that performance pay can lead to perceived pay inequity among employees. Taken together, our evidence suggests that agency costs and social comparison jointly influence pay within firms. The evidence also supports the notion that managers of multibusiness firms are constrained in the degree to which they can incentivize employees, given the firm-imposed reference group.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1109","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['social comparison', 'pay equity', 'performance sensitivity']","The article discusses social comparison and its impact on pay and performance within firms, touching on themes of pay equity.

We take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment in Japan that drastically reduced the stringency of bankruptcy regulations to examine this question. Using longitudinal data over a 10-year period, we find that bankruptcy reform increases the rates of bankruptcy and founding\u2014and, more importantly, the likelihood of high-growth ventures\u2014by disproportionately encouraging elite individuals (i.e., those with superior human and social capital) to start firms. In turn, these firms are more likely than others to achieve high growth. Broadly put, we contribute to research at the nexus of institutional theory and entrepreneurship by emphasizing the connectedness of barriers to failure, venture growth, and elite entrepreneurs. We also highlight how institutional change that eases bankruptcy change can foster a regenerative cycle of failure, founding, and growth by attracting more capable entrepreneurs.

Do Private Entrepreneurs Agglomerate Around Public Sector Incumbents During Economic Transition?","While it is well known that state enterprises in transition economies were displaced by private enterprises at a macro level, little is known about whether private entrepreneurs emerged in a way that helped preserve or shift preexisting agglomerations of industrial activity at a microgeographic level. To address this question, we integrate competing perspectives on the role of large, bureaucratic incumbents in spawning entrepreneurs. We conceptualize a trade-off between two countervailing effects of large incumbents on potential entrepreneurs: bureaucratic socialization and exposure to capabilities. This yields novel predictions about how different kinds of startups agglomerate around different kinds of incumbents. We test these predictions using fine-grained geographic data on founding rates by private entrepreneurs in China\u2019s bicycle manufacturing industry. Consistent with our theorized trade-off, we find evidence of a nonmonotonic effect of incumbent size on local founding rates by private entrepreneurs. Additional moderating effects are consistent with boundary conditions on the hypothesized mechanisms. Our results provide the first empirical investigation of the extent to which entrepreneurial activity agglomerated around public sector incumbents during economic transition. We discuss how these insights add to the understanding of economic transition as well as how the context of economic transition adds to the understanding of entrepreneurial spawning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1111","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['entrepreneurs', 'public sector', 'economic transition']","The article focuses primarily on the dynamics between private entrepreneurs and public sector incumbents during economic transitions, with an emphasis on economic factors rather than social justice or equity themes.

Using data on professional hockey teams\u2014where unexpected member change due to injury is frequent, but highly interdependent teams nonetheless carry out complex, time-sensitive work\u2014results indicate that the injury of central players negatively affects team performance, even when controlling for individual performance. Teams adapted to central exits by maintaining their existing interaction patterns, even though higher levels of relational experimentation following an injury were positively associated with performance.

We suggest that the family-to-work conflict (FWC) that CEOs experience depletes their ability to self-regulate, thereby reducing their ability to make appropriately comprehensive decisions for their firms. This reduced decision-making comprehensiveness, in turn, has negative implications for firm performance. We further propose that CEOs\u2019 levels of job engagement, or the extent to which they invest themselves in their work, can expand their capacity to withstand the negative effects of self-regulatory depletion. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 98 CEOs from the United States computer software and hardware industry. Findings confirm that reduced decision-making comprehensiveness represents one mechanism by which the experience of FWC in CEOs harms the performance of their firms. Moreover, CEO job engagement buffers both the negative effect of CEO FWC on decision-making comprehensiveness and the strength of the indirect relationship between FWC and firm performance via decision-making comprehensiveness.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1114","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['family-to-work conflict', 'decision-making', 'CEO']","The article discusses the impact of personal experiences on CEO decision-making, but it primarily focuses on firm performance rather than social justice or equity themes.

We work around this problem by studying an organization, the Indian Administrative Services, which deploys entry-level managers quasirandomly across India. We find that managers deployed to more challenging contexts early in their careers experience faster career advancement in the short term. We present suggestive evidence that this is because challenging contexts provide managers more opportunities to develop skills (\u201ccrucible experiences\u201d), and a greater motivation to relocate out of the challenging context. We also find that managers deployed to a challenging context early in their careers continue to experience faster advancement in the long term, suggesting that initial deployment to a challenging context is associated with human capital development.

We argue that to the extent that Chinese firms have been deeply embedded in China\u2019s informal institutions, they are less responsive to formal institutional changes than Western firms operating in China. Using the major China patent law reform of 2001 as an exogenous event, we find results consistent with our key arguments: With the strengthening of the previously weak (utility model) patent protection, Chinese firms are less likely to apply for such patents to safeguard their innovations than Western firms. However, this difference becomes less pronounced in regions with higher quality intellectual property rights and legal institutions that foster research and development and innovation, and when Western firms gain longer operational experience in China.

Results indicate that prior to the mid-2000s socially entrenched firms were less responsive to shareholder proposals. After the mid-2000s, socially entrenched firms were no less responsive.

Insights from Executive Cognition and Social Capital Theories","Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S&P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests.

This study argues that large firms have been a prominent labor-market institution that mitigates inequality. By compensating their low- and middle-wage employees with a greater premium than their higher-wage counterparts, large U.S. firms reduced overall wage dispersion. Yet, broader changes to employment relations associated with the demise of internal labor markets and the emergence of alternative employment arrangements have undermined large firms\u2019 role as an equalizing institution. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find that in 1989, although all private-sector workers benefited from a firm-size wage premium, the premium was significantly higher for individuals at the lower end and middle of the wage distribution compared to those at the higher end. Between 1989 and 2014, the average firm-size wage premium declined markedly. The decline, however, was exclusive to those at the lower end and middle of the wage distribution, while there was no change for those at the higher end. As such, the uneven declines in the premium across the wage spectrum could account for about 20% of rising wage inequality during this period, suggesting that firms are of great importance to the study of rising inequality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1125","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['inequality', 'wage premium', 'employment relations', 'labor-market', 'equalizing']","The article discusses wage inequality and the role of large firms in mitigating this issue, which aligns with themes of social justice and equity.

We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 397 licensed technologies.

To address this speculation, we use two experimental studies to explore the effects on the mean, median, variance, and skewness of performance of stretch compared with moderate goals. Participants were assigned moderate or stretch goals to manage a widely used business simulation. Compared with moderate goals, stretch goals improve performance for a few participants, but many abandon the stretch goals in favor of lower self-set goals, or adopt a survival goal when faced with the threat of bankruptcy. Consequently, stretch goals generate higher performance variance across organizations and a right-skewed performance distribution. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no positive stretch goal main effect on performance. Instead, stretch goals compared with moderate goals generate large attainment discrepancies that increase willingness to take risks, undermine goal commitment, and generate lower risk-adjusted performance. The results provide a richer theoretical and empirical appreciation of how stretch goals influence performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1131","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['performance', 'goals', 'risk']","The article primarily focuses on organizational performance metrics and the implications of goal-setting strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Accordingly, while scholars have traditionally focused on understanding the main motivations behind CVC activity and its impact on the investing corporate firm, more recently, scholars have also started to emphasize the importance of understanding the impact of CVC investment on the investee venture. In particular, these recent studies commonly show that CVC investment has a positive effect on the venture\u2019s innovation. While the positive link between CVC investment and the venture\u2019s innovation output is well established in the literature, the organizational mechanisms through which this relationship unfolds within the venture remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we fill this gap in the literature by examining the effects of CVC ownership, founder incumbency, and the CVC investor\u2013founder interaction on research and development (R&D) investment strategies in venture capital (VC)-financed, technology-based entrepreneurial ventures. In doing so, we aim to provide a novel explanation of the organizational mechanisms that lead to greater investment in research and development (R&D), especially with regard to the interaction between CVC investors and founder managers. We argue that CVC ownership and founder incumbency positively affect entrepreneurial firms\u2019 R&D investment and, more importantly, that the CVC ownership effect is effectively amplified when the founder is an incumbent top manager because of goal congruence and knowledge spillover from the CVC firm. Our empirical analysis supports our hypotheses while addressing potential endogeneity concerns.

While internal fit describes the important condition that a practice should be aligned with organizational goals and must gain support internally, external fit refers to an additional condition for successful transfer, namely, that a particular practice must gain and sustain support and legitimacy in the environment. Studying two German MNCs transferring apprenticeship-based training to foreign operations in the United States, this paper starts from the key observation that organizations can use different governance modes to organize the transfer process: they may either go it alone and organize transfer in a hierarchy mode, or they may partner up with other organizations and form an interorganizational network for transfer. Using rich qualitative data, this paper finds that different governance modes affect the ability to attain internal and external fit by revealing a critical trade-off: while hierarchy helps create internal fit, it comes with significant additional costs to attain external fit; conversely, using the network mode facilitates the creation of external fit, but involves making compromises that reduce internal fit. Based on these findings, I theorize that different governance modes (hierarchy versus network) work through distinct processes (autonomous versus collaborative), driven by unique mechanisms (inward versus outward orientation), to influence outcomes in terms of internal and external fit. The study contributes to the literature by shifting attention to the implications of different governance modes for transfer processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1135","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['governance', 'internal fit', 'external fit']","The article discusses governance modes and their impact on organizational practice transfer, but it does not emphasize social justice or equity themes.

Using rich network data collected inside two firms, this study examines the networks of professional managers citing a difficult work relationship (negative tie) revealing gender similarities and differences. Although women and men do not differ in their likelihood to cite a negative work tie, women are more likely (than men) to cite a woman as a negative tie. This propensity to cite a woman as difficult however is reduced among women who cite having more women in their social support networks at work compared with women citing fewer women for support.

We show that an initial, relatively minor limit violation set in train a cascade of human and technological limit violations, with catastrophic consequences. Focusing on cockpit automation, we argue that the same measures that make a system safe and predictable may introduce restrictions on cognition, which over time, inhibit or erode the disturbance-handling capability of the actors involved.

Although scholars have extensively examined the independent effects of trust and learning on contracts in repeated exchanges, their coevolution and combined impact have received much less attention. I argue this omission occurs largely because social cognition is not typically considered in these literatures, even though both trust development and learning are sociocognitive processes influenced by each other, as well as by heuristics (contract frames) and cognitive biases (intergroup attribution bias). When these processes are examined in a positive exchange, the contract frame (prevention or promotion) influences initial reputation-based trust or prior development of knowledge-based trust (competence or integrity), which biases what is learned. This biased learning further impacts knowledge-based trust development, and together these factors shape adjustments to subsequent contracts. In a negative exchange, the contract frame, prior reputation-based trust, and partner explanation (internal versus external) impact what is learned from partner violations (competence or integrity). This biased learning influences knowledge-based trust development, and together they shape how subsequent contracts are adjusted. I also propose that biased learning influences when contracts act as complements or substitutes for different types of trust, addressing existing debates and critiques in these literatures. Finally, I discuss the dark side of integrity trust and trust repair under promotion contracts in repeated exchanges.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1139","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'learning', 'cognitive biases']","The article discusses trust and learning in interfirm exchanges, touching on cognitive biases and social cognition, which are relevant to understanding ethical interactions in business.

Persistence and Change in Analysts\u2019 Evaluative Schemas Following Technological Change","We examine shifts in how analysts assess the strategies of incumbent firms following a radical technological change. Specifically, we use an inductive study of earnings conference call transcripts and analyst reports to study how analysts\u2019 evaluative schemas change with technological change in the wireline telecommunications industry. We find three temporal themes. At first, analysts pressure firms to reverse strategic changes that are at odds with the existing \u201cincome\u201d-focused metrics and logic that constitute the evaluative schema. Next, schema change unfolds with the ongoing technological change, as firm performance declines when measured with traditional metrics, and as managers frame strategic changes using new \u201cgrowth\u201d-focused metrics and logic. Finally, a distinct shift in the schema is apparent as analysts\u2019 increasing attention to growth spurs a more positive view of strategic changes that they previously opposed, a less positive view of previously supported strategies that conformed to an income logic, and the application of the growth logic even to a firm not pursuing growth-oriented strategic changes. Results from a supplementary content analysis support these results, showing a temporal shift toward \u201cgrowth\u201d words in analyst reports and conference calls. Our process model emphasizes the gradual shifts in analysts\u2019 evaluative schemas that ultimately support firm responses to a new technology. We highlight the importance of managerial framing as firms facing technological change pursue strategic responses that initially diverge from stakeholders\u2019 expectations, as well as the possibility that as schemas shift, actions that initially conform to analysts\u2019 expectations may be questioned.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1140","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['analysts', 'evaluative schemas', 'technological change']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of analysts' evaluations and the impact of technological change on traditional metrics, without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Knowledge leaks can undermine firm competitiveness, and to prevent this, firms deploy various isolating mechanisms to protect their knowledge. Integrating insights from the resource-based view and evolutionary theory, we hypothesize an inverted curvilinear relationship between extramural R&D and innovation and explain why the value protection strategies employed by firms change the relationship at various degrees of external knowledge sourcing. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 506 French manufacturing firms using data from three surveys conducted in the period 1998 to 2006. We find an inverted-U-shaped relationship between extramural R&D and innovation performance. This relationship is moderated by employee retention and secrecy such that the benefits of extramural R&D are weakened at lower degrees of extramural R&D while its downsides are mitigated at higher degrees of extramural R&D.

Network prominence can enhance the availability of alternative partners for a firm and thereby elevates the firm\u2019s bargaining power and enables the firm to receive (i) more value capturing rights vis-\u00e0-vis its partner (i.e., more net value capturing rights) and (ii) more rights to the unexpected outcomes vis-\u00e0-vis its partner. We empirically investigate the content of research and development (R&D) collaboration contracts between biotech and pharmaceutical firms and show that as the prominence of the client (i.e., pharmaceutical firm) increases, it is able to attain (i) more net value capturing rights to outcomes within the area of collaboration and (ii) more rights to unexpected outcomes. By contrast, increased prominence of the R&D firm (i.e., biotech firm) decreases both the number of net value capturing rights the client receives as well as the rights to unexpected outcomes that the client captures in an alliance contract. The bargaining power that the R&D firm attains from its prominent position in alliance networks becomes less important during hot IPO markets, which provide the R&D firm more outside options to obtain financial resources.

This is in stark contrast to the prominent agent-based theories of experiential learning and competitive selection that are known to be biased against risky alternatives in the long run. How can the positive managerial view on risk taking prevail given these results? Qualitative surveys of managers suggest risks to be acceptable if their outcome distribution meets certain criteria. We argue in this paper that these criteria are widely congruent with low downside risk. Using a novel simulation design, we analyze the effects of experiential learning and competitive selection on downside risk preferences in an ecology of agents. In the long run, experiential learning implies weak downside risk seeking, whereas competitive selection leads to strong downside risk aversion. Furthermore, competitive selection leads to the prevalence of outcome distributions with low downside risk in an ecology, even if they have a significantly higher level of total risk than comparable distributions with more downside risk.

Our key premise is that a broader product portfolio, while offering benefits through the bundle of complementary activities, raises the coordination costs for firms, making integration of complementary activities a preferred mode of governance. We find strong support for our arguments in the context of the U.S. healthcare industry. Hospitals with a narrow service portfolio are more likely to have contracts with physicians as external service providers, and hospitals with a broad service portfolio are more likely to employ their own physicians. Moreover, hospitals that deviate from this fit-based relationship suffer a significant penalty in terms of their financial performance as measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS). Our findings allow us to shed new light on the linkage between strategy and governance mode and enable us to illustrate that performance differences across multiproduct firms may be better understood by considering the fit between their strategy and their governance mode instead of simply focusing either on their strategy or on their governance mode per se.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1150","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on governance modes and financial performance in multiproduct firms without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A vast, influential literature has detailed the ways in which ties facilitate the flow of information about job opportunities to workers as well as endorsements or referrals of workers to firms. We propose that this role is not constrained to an informational one alone. Rather, relationships between workers can enable a collective job-matching process that facilitates the transfer of shared human capital from one organization to another. Yet \u201ccomobility\u201d has been studied only occasionally and among elite workers in particular industries. This study delivers both fieldwork as well as large-sample analysis among all nongovernmental workers in Denmark, finding a 5.5% wage premium for those who move jointly instead of independently, both in the full sample as well as when applying strict matching or fixed effects for workers or firms. Co-movers whose skills are related but not identical capture a higher premium, and the wage gains associated with comobility are not limited to highly skilled workers but rather obtain across a wide range of occupations. Robustness tests establish that the wage premium associated with comobility is not driven by efforts to capture \u201cprized\u201d workers, by employee referrals, or by aggressive hiring by firms. This study provides the first quantification of the anticipated value of comobility, suggesting that both workers and firms may want to revisit individualistic assumptions about how labor markets function.

The experience of a crisis, and the handling of the crisis, can be seen as a test of cohesion that verifies community support of organizations or proves its absence. Using data on two bank panics 14 years apart, we explore whether a crisis event affects whether banks in a community handle the subsequent crisis through community collective action or through executing interorganizational solutions. We find that banks are less likely to seek community support when a prior financial crisis exposes the lack of trust from community members but are more likely to do so when having the experience of successfully avoiding a looming crisis. Organizational memory carries past experience into the future, and the banks that have directly experienced the absence of community trust prefer an interorganizational solution for the next financial crisis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1157","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['community', 'trust', 'collective action', 'crisis', 'support']","The article discusses the role of community cohesion and trust in organizational responses to crises, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics and collective action.

Within teams, a combination of higher and lower cognitive ability levels may be productive insofar as some individuals can be assigned to mundane tasks (that are often involved in implementation), while others can be assigned to tasks that impose a greater cognitive load (problem solving or opportunity recognition).

Existing publications emphasize the importance of time sensitivity but also reflect divergent, untested perspectives. Prior works do not clearly explain or examine how different mechanisms are associated with achieving time-sensitive versus general (or non-time-sensitive) performance. We build on concepts from organizational mindfulness and organizational routines to address these gaps. Specifically, this paper examines how the mindful use of information technologies and adherence to specified routines are associated with both time-sensitive and general organizational performance. We employ split-group structural equation modeling based on high and low levels of information technology adoption to account for potential technology contingencies in performance. We use time-sequenced data from 262 U.S. hospitals to analyze two categories of clinical care quality: time-sensitive care and general care. The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with both time-sensitive and general performance in contexts with high technology adoption but not in those with low adoption. In contrast, adherence to specified routines is associated with time-sensitive performance in contexts with low technology adoption but not in those with high adoption. The results also clarify that high levels of technology adoption and mindful use may at times assume the place of specified routines in their association with time-sensitive performance. Finally, we find evidence that continuous improvement may bridge adherence to specified routines and mindful use of technologies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1159","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['mindful', 'organizational performance', 'technologies']","The article discusses 'mindful use' of technologies, which hints at a consideration for ethical practices in organizational performance.

We validate and further develop our model through qualitative content analysis and semantic network analytical methods applied to the website of a large organization. Our study contributes to recent literature on institutional pluralism by further specifying the structural aspects of constellations of logics and different types of institutional pluralism (monolithic, fragmented, and modular).

In the specialized nature of these environments, a common problem faced by software vendors is to correctly signal the true value of a software product to the end users. For example, telecommunications equipment manufacturers design complex software for important functions like provisioning new users in the network. These software products automate various functions that would otherwise need to be done manually. In order to enable potential customers\u2014telecommunications providers\u2014to evaluate and recognize the full value of the product, equipment vendors often provide a free, feature\u2010limited version of the product to the customer. As the specific features included in the feature\u2010limited version influence whether the full product is purchased or not, it is essential that the features included in the feature\u2010limited version be selected judiciously. While the importance of identifying the best set of features has been well recognized, there has been little research to date that systematically addresses this fundamental business decision.

Moreover, we provide a recursive computing procedure and optimality conditions for both heuristics which dramatically reduces computational complexity. We also find that the NBN problem under the MMFE faced by one stage has one more dimension for the forecast demand than the one faced by its downstream stage and that the NBN policy is optimal for systems with advance demand information and stationary problem data.

We find that the fraction of strategic consumers in the market systematically moderates the optimal pricing structure. When this fraction exceeds a certain threshold, the retailer offers relatively small late season markdowns to discourage strategic consumers from waiting and to incentivize them to buy during the early season; otherwise, the retailer offers relatively large markdowns to divert all strategic consumers to the late season, where the majority of revenue is made. Our model analyses suggest that the latter policy is optimal under fairly broad conditions. Our experiment shows that after some significant learning, aggregate behavior is able to approximate the key qualitative predictions from our model analysis, with one notable deviation: in the presence of a mixture of myopic and strategic consumers, subjects act somewhat myopically \u2013 they underprice and oversell in the main selling season, which significantly limits their ability to generate revenue in the markdown season.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12607","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and consumer behavior without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There is insufficient time to replenish inventory during this season, hence sales are made entirely from inventory. The demand for the product is a stochastic, nonincreasing function of price. We assume interval uncertainty for demand, that is, knowledge of upper and lower bounds but not a probability distribution, with no correlation between the two periods. We minimize the maximum total regret over the two periods that results from the pricing decisions. We consider a dynamic model where the decision maker chooses the price for each period contingent on the remaining inventory at the beginning of the period, and a static model where the decision maker chooses the prices for both periods at the beginning of the first period. Both models can be solved by a polynomial time algorithm that solves systems of linear inequalities.

This leads to important unresolved questions regarding why some firms are able to derive substantial value from their outsourcing initiatives while other firms are left disappointed. This study joins an emerging literature integrating transaction cost economics and capabilities\u2010based perspectives to develop a deeper understanding of the drivers of outsourcing performance. I develop a theoretical model that examines the independent and joint influence of governance misalignment (i.e., deviation from transaction cost's predicted mode of governance) and a firm's outsourcing capability on the performance of outsourced processes. I test the theoretical model using a dataset of 172 outsourced and 156 in\u2010house processes. The finding that governance misalignment corresponds to inferior process performance supports transaction cost's discriminating alignment hypothesis. Interestingly, I also find that a retained technical expertise (TE) and outsourcing knowledge management routines (OKMR; both contributors to a firm's outsourcing capability) positively influence outsourcing performance both directly and via their relationship with governance misalignment. While a retained technical expertise and outsourcing knowledge management routines each positively influence outsourcing performance, they do so in distinctive ways. These findings have important managerial implications and make a significant theoretical contribution. Specifically, this study demonstrates that the notion of a governance misalignment is firm\u2010specific, conditional on the governance capabilities of the organization. This insight underscores the value of integrating transaction cost logic with capabilities\u2010based perspectives.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12609","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on governance misalignment and outsourcing performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The electricity company offers the flat rate (FR) and TOU tariffs to customers. Under the FR tariff, the customer pays a flat price for electricity consumption in both the peak and non\u2010peak periods. Under the TOU tariff, the customer pays a high price for electricity consumption in the peak period and a low price for electricity consumption in the non\u2010peak period. The electricity company uses two technologies, namely the base\u2010load and peak\u2010load technologies, to generate electricity. We derive the optimal capacity investment and pricing decisions for the electricity company. Furthermore, we use real data from a case study to validate the results and derive insights for implementing the TOU tariff. We show that in almost all the cases, the electricity company needs less capacity for both technologies under the TOU tariff than under the FR tariff, even though the expected demand in the non\u2010peak period increases. In addition, except for some extreme cases, there is essentially no signicant reduction in the total demand of the two periods, although the TOU tariff can reduce the demand in the peak period. Under the price\u2010cap regulation, the customer may pay a lower price on average under the TOU tariff than under the FR tariff.

To approach this ideal, forecasting order quantities with high accuracy is essential. Many drivers of online sales, including seasonality, special promotions and public holidays, are well known, and they have been frequently incorporated into forecasting approaches. However, the impact of weather on e\u2010commerce operations has not been rigorously analyzed. In this study, we integrate weather data into the sales forecasting of the largest European online fashion retailer. We find that sunshine, temperature, and rain have a significant impact on daily sales, particularly in the summer, on weekends, and on days with extreme weather. Using weather forecasts, we have significantly improved sales forecast accuracy. We find that including weather data in the sales forecast model can lead to fewer sales forecast errors, reducing them by, on average, 8.6% to 12.2% and up to 50.6% on summer weekends. In turn, the improvement in sales forecast accuracy has a measurable impact on logistics and warehousing operations. We quantify the value of incorporating weather forecasts in the planning process for the order fulfillment center workforce and show how their incorporation can be leveraged to reduce costs and increase performance.

The result is that current scheduling models are optimizing based on inaccurate input data. We developed a Clustering and Scheduling Integrated (CSI) approach to capture patient flows through a network of hospital services. CSI functions by clustering patients into groups based on similarity of trajectory using a novel semi\u2010Markov model (SMM)\u2010based clustering scheme, as opposed to clustering by patient attributes as in previous literature. Our methodology is validated by simulation and then applied to real patient data from a partner hospital where we demonstrate that it outperforms a suite of well\u2010established clustering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that extant optimization methods achieve significantly better results on key hospital performance measures under CSI, compared with traditional estimation approaches, increasing elective admissions by 97% and utilization by 22% compared to 30% and 8% using traditional estimation techniques.

Many retailers set markdown budgets prior to the season to control margin erosion and increase profitability. Markdown budget constrains the buyers on the amount of discounts that they can apply on a given inventory of merchandise and sets a limit on the dollar value of markdowns for the season. While markdown budgets may be useful in preventing excessive discounts, they can have a detrimental effect on the buyers' ability to respond to poor market and remove distressed inventory. We investigate the effectiveness of this practice in aligning the incentives of buyers with that of the firm, and provide guidance on how these budgets should be established ahead of time. We consider a firm with a fixed inventory of a seasonable item, and a single chance to mark the price down. The retailer knows only the demand distribution at the beginning of the season, but the market information is revealed during the season to the buyer. We first characterize the buyer's markdown policy and understand the circumstances under which this can be different from the retailer's markdown policy.

Entrepreneurial ventures often fail to attain financial viability due to the initial design of the business model and the inability to evolve the model over time. We focus on the influence of service offerings, revenue models, and their evolution on the viability of HIEs. Using a unique archival dataset constructed from surveys of HIEs in the United States from 2008 to 2010, we find that providing an extensive service bundle may lead to higher operational maturity with the HIE's increasing age, but this may deter the HIE's potential to achieve financial viability. The findings also show that the influence of service offerings on financial viability is mediated by operational maturity. Qualitative evidence corroborates these findings and suggests that HIEs need to move from providing a set of foundational services to offering more advanced services as they evolve and that they need to appropriately bundle the services using transaction\u2010, subscription\u2010 or mixed\u2010fee models.

Patients in the public system are given a subsidy s to use private service if their waiting times exceed a pre\u2010determined threshold t. We call these subsidy schemes (s,\u00a0t) policies. As two extreme cases, the (s,\u00a0t) policy is called an unconditional subsidy scheme if t\u00a0=\u00a00, and a full subsidy scheme if s is equal to the private service fee. There is a fixed budget constraint so that a scheme with larger s has a larger t. We assess policies using two criteria: total patient cost and serviceability (i.e., the probability of meeting a waiting time target for public service). We prove analytically that, if patients are equally sensitive to delay, a scheme with a smaller subsidy outperforms one with a larger subsidy on both criteria. Thus, the unconditional scheme dominates all other policies. Using empirically derived parameter values from the Hong Kong Cataract Surgery Program, we then compare policies numerically when patients differ in delay sensitivity. Total patient cost is now unimodal in subsidy amount: the unconditional scheme still yields the lowest total patient cost, but the full subsidy scheme can outperform some intermediate policies. Serviceability is unimodal too, and the full subsidy scheme can outperform the unconditional scheme in serviceability when the waiting time target is long.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12738","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['subsidy', 'healthcare', 'waiting times']","The article focuses on technical aspects of subsidy schemes in healthcare without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

Due to the temporary nature of the relations between customers and service providers (agents) in these marketplaces, customers may not have an opportunity to assess the ability of an agent before their service completion. On the other hand, the moderating firm has a more sustained relationship with agents, and thus it can provide customers with more information about the abilities of agents through skill screening mechanisms. In this study, we consider a marketplace where the moderating firm can run two skills tests on agents to assess if their skills are above certain thresholds. Our main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of skill screening as a revenue maximization tool. We, specifically, analyze how much benefit the firm obtains after each additional skill test. We find that skill screening leads to negligible revenue improvements in marketplaces where agent skills are highly compatible and the average service times are similar for all customers. As the compatibility of agent skills weakens or the customers start to vary in their processing time needs, we show that the firm starts to experience sizable improvements in revenue from skill screening. Apparently, the firm can reap the most of these substantial benefits when it runs only one test. For instance, in marketplaces where agents posses uncorrelated skills, the second skill test only brings an additional 2% improvement in revenue. Accounting for possible skill screening costs, we then show the optimality of offering only one test when the compatibility between agent skills is sufficiently low. The results of this study also have important implications in terms of the right level of intervention in the marketplaces we study.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12741","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of skill management and revenue maximization in service marketplaces, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These personnel, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are often collectively referred to as \u201cmid\u2010level providers\u201d (MLPs) and can perform many patient\u2010consultation tasks. The common rationale is that using an MLP allows the physician to serve more patients, increase patients\u2019 access to care, and, due to MLPs\u2019 lower salaries, improve the clinic's financial performance. An MLP is typically integrated into the outpatient clinic process in one of two modes: as an \u201cice\u2010breaker,\u201d seeing each patient before the physician, or as a \u201cstandalone\u201d provider, a substitute for the physician for the entirety of some patients\u2019 visits.

Traditional procedures characterizing the order\u2010up\u2010to level satisfying a specified fill rate implicitly assume an infinite performance review horizon. However, in practice, inventory managers are liable to maintain and report fill rates over a finite performance review horizon. This horizon discrepancy leads to deviation between the target fill rate and actual achieved fill rate. In this study, we first examine the behavior of the fill rate distribution over a finite horizon with positive lead time. We analytically prove that the expected fill rate assuming an infinite performance review horizon exceeds the expected fill rate assuming a finite performance review horizon, implying that there exists some inventory \u201cwaste\u201d (i.e., overstocking) when the traditional procedure is used. Based on this observation and the complexity of the problem, we propose a simulation\u2010based algorithm to reduce excess inventory while maintaining the contractual target fill rate. When the lead time is significant relative to the length of the contract horizon, we show that the improvement in the inventory system can be over 5%. Further, we extend our basic setting to incorporate the penalty for failing to meet a target, and show how one can solve large\u2010scale problems via stochastic approximation. The primary managerial implication of our study is that ignoring the performance review horizon in an SLA will cause overstocking, especially when the lead time is large.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12750","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Rush orders are costly to both parties because the supplier incurs higher production costs. We consider a situation where the supplier's production cost is reduced if the manufacturer can place some of its order in advance. In addition to the rush order contract with a pre\u2010established price, we examine whether the supplier should offer advance\u2010order discounts to encourage the manufacturer to place a portion of its order in advance, even though the manufacturer incurs some inventory risk. While the advance\u2010order discount contract is Pareto\u2010improving, our analysis shows that the discount contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. However, if the supplier imposes a pre\u2010specified minimum order quantity requirement as a qualifier for the manufacturer to receive the advance\u2010order discount, then\u00a0such a combined contract can coordinate the supply chain. Furthermore, the combined contract enables the supplier to attain the first\u2010best solution. We also explore a delegation contract that either party could propose.

We study how ambiguity in processing times affects a port's attractiveness under various circumstances.

This \u201cinformal\u201d replenishment strategy is inefficient due to high imputed travel costs involved in the replenishment process. To improve efficiency, one \u201chybrid\u201d replenishment strategy has emerged under which one of the micro\u2010retailers in a neighborhood, while continuing its own retail business, also operates as a wholesaler to serve other micro\u2010retailers in the neighborhood. A major obstacle for the transition from the informal strategy to the hybrid strategy is that the micro\u2010retailers are reluctant to source from a wholesaler who also competes with them in the retail market. Thus, it is not clear when the micro\u2010retailers adopt the hybrid strategy instead of the informal strategy. Meanwhile, the micro\u2010retailers may prefer the \u201cformal\u201d strategy: a traditional replenishment strategy under which one of the micro\u2010retailers relinquishes its retail business and operates purely as a wholesaler. We examine a situation when competing micro\u2010retailers contemplate with the three potential aforementioned replenishment strategies. Our equilibrium analysis of the two\u2010store model reveals that the dominant strategy is: (a) the hybrid strategy when the travel cost is high; (b) the formal strategy when the travel cost is medium; and (c) the informal strategy when the travel cost is low. This key insight is shown continue to hold when we extend the two\u2010store model to incorporate other issues including: quantity discounts from the supplier, variable operating costs, price competition, local monopolies, and different decision sequences. One additional finding is that the transition from the informal strategy to the hybrid strategy could benefit consumers if the micro\u2010retailers receive quantity discounts from the supplier. Furthermore, when there are more than two stores, we show that the formal strategy is never dominant.

Immediately after the number of guaranteed reservations meets the pre\u2010specified threshold, the retailer will reduce its selling price to the discount price so that all subsequent arriving consumers can take immediate possession by paying the low price. We study the consumer purchasing behavior in equilibrium when the retailer adopts such a selling mechanism, and compare the performance of our mechanism against two benchmarks: fixed price (FP) and pre\u2010announced discount (PD). Through an extensive numerical analysis, we identify market conditions under which CM dominates both FP and PD in terms of the retailer's revenue and consumer's surplus.

Thus, rolling schedules are able to take realizations and updated forecasts of uncertain data (e.g., customer demands) into account. Furthermore, it is common to hold safety stocks to ensure given service levels (e.g., fill rate). As we will show, this approach, implemented in rolling schedules, often results in increased setup and holding costs while (over\u2010)accomplishing given fill rates. A well\u2010known alternative to deterministic planning models are stochastic, static, multi\u2010period planning models used in the static uncertainty strategy, which results in stable plans. However, these models have a lack of flexibility to react to the realization of uncertain data. As a result, actual costs may differ widely from planned costs, and downside deviations of actual fill rates from those given are very high. We propose a new strategy, namely the stabilized cycle. This combines and expands upon ideas from the literature for minimizing setup and holding costs in rolling schedules, while controlling actual product\u2010specific fill rates for a finite reporting period. A computational study with a multi\u2010item capacitated medium\u2010term production planning model has been executed in rolling schedules. On the one hand, it demonstrates that the stabilized\u2010cycle strategy yields a good compromise between costs and downside deviations. Furthermore, the stabilized\u2010cycle strategy weakly dominates the order\u2010based strategy for both constant and seasonal demands.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12757","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management, specifically on lot sizing and cost minimization strategies, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2017","26","12","I\u015f\u0131k Bi\u00e7er and Ralf W.

To model the evolution of demand forecasts, we use both additive and multiplicative versions of the martingale model of forecast evolution. We first derive expressions for the optimal base stock levels for a single\u2010product model. We find that manufacturers located near their market bases can realize most of their potential profits (i.e., profit made when the capacity is unlimited) by building a very limited amount of capacity. For moderate demand uncertainty, we also show that it is almost impossible for manufacturers to compensate for the increase in supply\u2013demand mismatches resulting from long delivery lead times by increasing capacity, making lead\u2010time reduction a better alternative than capacity expansion. We then extend the model to a multi\u2010product case and derive expressions for the optimal production quantities for each product given a shared capacity constraint.

MNFs that strategically position parts of their supply chains in low\u2010tax locations can allocate the profits across the divisions to improve post\u2010tax profits. For the profit allocation to be defensible to tax authorities, the divisional operations must possess real decision authority and bear meaningful risks. Generally speaking, the greater the transfer of risk and control, the larger the allowable allocation of profit. These transfers may also create inefficiencies due to misalignment of business goals and attitudes toward risk. We model these trade\u2010offs in the context of placing in a low\u2010tax region a subsidiary that oversees product distribution (as a limited risk distributor commissionnaire, limited risk distributor, or fully fledged distributor). Our analysis demonstrates that the MNF's preferences regarding the operating structures are not necessarily an obvious ordering based on the amount of risk and decision authority transferred to the division in the low\u2010tax jurisdiction. We derive and analyze threshold values of the performance parameters that describe the main trade\u2010offs involved in selecting an operating structure.

We focus on a supply chain consisting of a home plant and a foreign branch, both of which are under the same parent company but have considerable autonomy. The role of the home plant is to provide a key component to the foreign branch with guaranteed service (required by the headquarters). Because of a high fixed order cost, the branch orders the component rather infrequently, causing high expediting costs at the home plant. Our purpose is to help the headquarters to improve the supply chain efficiency. We show that under certain conditions, the headquarters can coordinate the supply chain by setting an upper bound on the expediting frequency. If these conditions fail to hold, a simple fixed cost\u2010sharing contract coordinates the supply chain. When centralized control is too costly or infeasible, the headquarters may delegate the contract design rights to the subunits. If the home plant receives the rights, the supply chain performance can be significantly improved (sometimes to near optimality).

Recent industry surveys report that the abuse of channel incentives is a primary reason for the growth of gray market activities. Therefore, it is crucial that companies take the presence of gray markets into consideration when they design contracts to distribute products through authorized retailers. This issue has received little attention in the extensive literature on contracting and supply chain coordination. In this study, we analyze the impacts of gray markets on two classic contracts, wholesale price and quantity discount, in a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer when the retailer has the opportunity to sell to a domestic gray market. Our analysis provides interesting and counterintuitive results. First, a classic quantity\u2010discount contract that normally coordinates the supply chain can perform so poorly in the presence of a gray market that the supply chain would be better off using a wholesale price contract instead. Second, the presence of gray market can also degrade the performance of the wholesale price contract; therefore, a more sophisticated contract is needed for coordinating the supply chain. We show that contracts that solely depend on retailer's order quantity cannot coordinate the supply chain, and provide the conditions for coordinating the supply chain with price\u2010dependent quantity discount contracts. We also provide comparative statics and show that when there is a gray market, coordinating the supply chain enhances total consumer welfare.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12635","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['consumer welfare', 'gray market', 'supply chain']","The article discusses the impact of gray markets on supply chain contracts and mentions 'total consumer welfare,' which suggests a consideration of broader societal implications.

Similar to international gray markets, domestic gray markets are a growing phenomenon whose impact on supply chains is not clear. We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and several authorized retailers who face a newsvendor problem and a domestic gray market. While a gray market provides an opportunity for retailers to clear their excess inventory (inventory\u2010correction effect), it also can be a threat to their demand (demand\u2010cannibalization effect). We first characterize the emerging equilibrium by assuming an MSRP environment. Comparing a decentralized and centralized system, we show that a wholesale pricing contract is quite efficient in a gray market environment; we explain the underlying mechanism and note some of the operational decisions that could hurt that efficiency. We show that the gray market price determines the degree of both the negative effects of demand\u2010cannibalization and the positive effects of inventory correction, which in turn determines the net impact of gray markets on the retailer's stocking choice and, ultimately, the manufacturer's profit. We then study the authorized retailers' problem as a price\u2010setting newsvendor. We observe that the gray market creates price competition between the authorized and unauthorized retailers, causing a drop in the primary market price. However, this price competition can be counteracted by the authorized retailers' stocking decision.

We used dyadic data from 106 buyers and their matched suppliers gathered from a survey and an archival database. The results demonstrate that the degree and direction of both asymmetries affect the BSR. Our results also reveal that an imbalance of relational capital in a firm's favor may have the opposite effect from that intended. In other words, the firm's counterpart perceives more, rather than less, firm opportunism. The results also suggest that a buyer observes lower benefits in the presence of size asymmetry, whereas the supplier's perception of benefits is unaffected. Thus, our research represents a significant step forward in understanding BSRs and asymmetries by (i) bringing attention to two key asymmetries inherent in BSRs and (ii) showing that these asymmetries are not unidirectional in their influence on perceived opportunism and performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12648","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['asymmetries', 'opportunism', 'performance']","The article focuses on technical aspects of buyer-supplier relationships and performance metrics without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that the manufacturer should treat his information acquisition and quality disclosure decisions as an integrated process because these decisions can significantly influence a retailer's rational inferences about product quality and can have conflicting effects on his own profitability. Although information acquisition helps a manufacturer subsequently craft better pricing and quality disclosure strategies, it also leaks certain product information to the retailer, thus helping the retailer better estimate product quality. Therefore, in equilibrium, a manufacturer may choose not to acquire any consumer information, even when such acquisition is costless. Moreover, we find that this adverse effect of acquisition is highly dependent on the cost of disclosure and consumers\u2019 preference differentiation. Increased consumer preference differentiation may have a non\u2010monotonic relationship with the manufacturer's profit, and information acquisition can become detrimental to the manufacturer once the disclosure cost is sufficiently high.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12651","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information acquisition and quality disclosure in supply chains, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

However, when the unit cost is high, the platform sets its transaction fee to be less than the market clearing price, intentionally leaving money on the table, as a mechanism to stimulate first period demand for new goods in expectation for some of them to be traded later, in the second period, via the marketplace. It is not until the surplus left with the sellers is sufficiently high that the supply chain partners manage to extract some of this surplus, ultimately making them better off due to a P2P marketplace.

These two decisions may be dependent, as appointments are more likely to be scheduled by patients who are more patient and are thereby more likely to show up. To estimate the effect of wait on these two decisions, we introduce the willingness to wait (WTW), an unobservable variable that affects both bookings and arrivals for appointments. Using data from a large healthcare system, we estimate WTW with a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art non\u2010parametric method. The WTW, in turn, allows us to estimate the effect of wait on no\u2010shows.

Thus, although reducing the wait to an appointment will enable a provider to capture more patient bookings, the effects of wait time on capacity utilization can be non\u2010monotone.

However, the distribution of these digital goods in conjunction with their physical analogs (i.e., printed books) has been operationally problematic for media supply chains. Specifically, the types of contracts utilized to distribute these goods such as agency models have come under fire in the press. A high profile case brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against Apple exemplifies this debate as the DOJ claims that the agency model utilized by Apple caused higher prices and decreased consumer surplus. We create and analyze a model of vertically differentiated goods to compare and contrast the agency model with the wholesale model. We ascertain that both (a) the revenue\u2010sharing structure and (b) the upstream publisher's control over the price contribute to the benefits of the agency model. We consider a variation of this model which shows that if the retailer utilizes a \u201cfixed price\u201d model, then he suffers from a short\u2010term loss in profit, possibly to garner additional market share. We also investigate an incentive alignment condition for the agency model which assures that the retailer and the publisher will together commit to selling digital goods alongside physical goods in the supply chain. Finally, we analyze an extension of the original model which incorporates horizontal differentiation in addition to vertical differentiation and shows that in most cases, the horizontal differentiation does not alter our original results that the agency model outperforms the wholesale model.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12595","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['accessibility', 'consumer surplus', 'agency model']","The article primarily focuses on operational and economic aspects of digital goods distribution, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In such projects, it is often challenging to estimate how much progress can be achieved within a certain time window or how much time may be needed to achieve a certain degree of progress, especially because the client and vendor often adjust their efforts as a function of the project's progress, the time until the deadline, and the incentives in place. Effective contracts should therefore be flexible in scope and foster collaboration. In this study, we characterize the collaborative work dynamics of a client and a vendor who are engaged in a multi\u2010state, multi\u2010period stochastic project with a finite deadline. We show that when the client can verify the vendor's effort, it is optimal that they both exert high effort in one of two situations: when either not enough progress has been made and the deadline is close (deadline effect), or conversely, when so much progress has been made that the project state is close to a completion state set by the client (milestone effect). Hence, in this case, progress will typically be faster when the project is about to be stopped, due to either reaching the deadline or reaching the client's desired completion state. However, when the client cannot verify the vendor's effort, the vendor is prone to free\u2010riding. Considering a time\u2010based contract that pays the vendor a per\u2010period fee and a fixed completion bonus, we show that the equilibrium completion state is decreasing in the per\u2010period fee and increasing in the bonus, justifying the use of both incentive mechanisms in practice. Moreover, we show that, under such contracts, some form of milestone effect arises in equilibrium, but the deadline effect does not. Hence, in those cases, early progress will typically lead to early project conclusion at a high state; whereas, slow progress will typically make the project drag until the deadline while still at a low state.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12670","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['collaboration', 'flexible contracts', 'vendor effort']","The article discusses collaboration and flexible contracts in project management, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This study focuses on one of these key dynamics: helping among information technology (IT) implementation project team members. We uniquely distinguish between perceptions of receiving more help than one personally provides to other team members (positive inequity), vs. giving more than one receives (negative inequity). We argue, using an equity theory frame, that members have a tendency to resolve perceived inequity by adjusting subsequent levels of helping, but that the extent of adjustment is moderated by task interdependence. Results from an empirical evaluation of 591 members in 107 IT implementation teams, examined at several points throughout their project cycles, provide insight into these relationships. Extending and bounding equity theory, we find that lower interdependence augments the effect of positive inequity on subsequent helping, but leaves the effect of negative inequity unaffected. Further, we find support for an inverted U\u2010shaped relationship between the level of subsequent helping in a team and the final cost of implementation. This holds critical implications for project team design and ensuing dynamics.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12671","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['equity', 'responsibility', 'helping']","The article discusses themes of equity and responsibility within team dynamics, which suggests a moderate focus on ethical considerations.

We show that under these circumstances, a firm's optimal upgrade strategy is characterized by a threshold policy based on the level of pent\u2010up demand for their next generation product.

Inspired by a supplier\u2010facilitated transshipment scheme observed in practice, we assume the supplier implements transshipments through a bi\u2010directional adjustment contract. Under this contract, each retailer can either buy additional inventory from, or sell back excess inventory to, the supplier. We show that coordination can be achieved through carefully designed contracts with state\u2010dependent adjustment prices and a wholesale price menu. We demonstrate that the supplier's role in facilitating coordinating transshipments is critical.

There are multiple classes of customers arriving according to a multi\u2010class Poisson process. Each customer, upon arrival, submits a service request that specifies his service start time and end time. Our model allows customer advanced reservation times and services times in each class to be arbitrarily distributed and correlated. Upon arrival of each customer, the seller must instantaneously decide whether to accept this customer's service request. A customer whose request is denied leaves the system. A customer whose request is accepted is allocated with a specific item of the resource at his service start time. The resource unit occupied by a customer becomes available to other customers after serving this customer. The seller aims to design an admission control policy that maximizes her expected long\u2010run average revenue. We propose a policy called the \u03b5\u2010perturbation class selection policy (\u03b5\u2010CSP), based on the optimal solution in the fluid setting wherein customers are infinitesimal and customer arrival processes are deterministic, under the restriction that the seller can utilize at most (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b5) of her capacity for any \u03b5\u00a0\u2208\u00a0(0,\u00a01).

We show that in the absence of competitive externalities and interdependent risks, a firm will outsource security if and only if the MSSP offers a quality advantage over in\u2010house operations, which is consistent with the conventional explanation for security outsourcing. However, when security risks are interdependent and breaches impose competitive externalities, although firms still have stronger incentive to outsource security if the MSSP offers a higher quality in terms of preventing breaches than in\u2010house management, a quality advantage of MSSP over in\u2010house management is neither a prerequisite for a firm to outsource security nor a guarantee that a firm will. In addition to MSSP quality, the type of externality (positive or negative), the degree of externality, whether outsourcing increases or decreases risk interdependency, and the breach characteristics determine firms' sourcing decisions. When security breaches impose a positive externality, the incentive to outsource is enhanced if the MSSP decreases the risk interdependency and diminished if the MSSP increases this interdependency. A negative externality has the opposite effect on firms' incentives to outsource. A high demand spillover to a competitor, together with a high loss in industry demand because of a security breach, enhances these incentives to outsource security operations when the externality is negative. Finally, we extend our base model in several dimensions and show that our main results regarding the impact of interdependent risks and competitive externalities on sourcing decisions are robust and generalizable to different specifications.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12681","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['risk interdependency', 'competitive externalities', 'outsourcing']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing information security operations with an emphasis on cost reduction and quality improvement.

As GreenBlue takes MiQ to market, it must determine under what market conditions to promote the use of MiQ and when to recommend that a buyer uses its implementation as an opportunity to work with an existing supplier. We study GreenBlue's problem in two parts. First, we investigate when a buyer can use a wholesale price premium and/or buyer\u2013supplier cost sharing to improve a supplier's environmental performance. Based on our findings, we then develop insights into GreenBlue's strategy. We model both a single\u2010supplier and a supplier\u2010competition setting. We find that in the single\u2010supplier setting, if the buyer's optimal strategy is to offer the supplier a premium, then he also fully subsidizes her investment cost to build quality. By developing the supplier's capabilities, the buyer can increase the impact of the premium he offers. In the supplier\u2010competition setting, although cost sharing is less effective as a lever, cases can occur in which the buyer chooses to share costs and prevent the incumbent supplier from having to compete. From GreenBlue's perspective, promoting the use of MiQ and cost sharing are often viable strategies when there exists a one\u2010to\u2010one relationship between a buyer and a supplier. However, GreenBlue's strategy becomes more restricted when competition exists between suppliers.

We show that subsidy programs provide stronger incentives to a not\u2010for\u2010profit firm than to its for\u2010profit counterpart in inducing a large consumption whenever the sponsor is having a very limited budget or a very generous budget. When subsidizing a not\u2010for\u2010profit firm, the sponsor should always choose the purchase subsidy over the sales subsidy because the former can induce a larger consumption than the latter with the same subsidy spending. However, this is not always true when the subsidy program is administered through a for\u2010profit firm, unless the firm is a price taker in the market or the sponsor has a limited budget.

In addition to raising funds from donors who contribute prior to project implementation (\u201ctraditional donors\u201d), the NPO uses a novel approach, which we term as the \u201cex\u2010post funding\u201d approach, to also raise funds from donors who contribute based on the results delivered by the NPO (\u201cex\u2010post donors\u201d).

The donations raised from selling the results\u2010certificates are used to recover the NPO's own funds used in the project implementation. Operationalizing this approach is complicated when the project must incur a large fixed cost before any benefits are delivered by the project and the total benefit delivered is time sensitive. We show that for a given amount of initial funds available, there exists a threshold amount of funds that the NPO should raise from traditional donors before implementing the project phases so as to maximize the total expected benefit delivered. Through numerical studies, we analyze how the threshold of funds raised from traditional donors and the total benefit delivered vary with donor characteristics such as donor willingness to give and the proportion of donors who contribute prior to project implementation. Our numerical studies suggest that even with relatively small amount of initial funds, the NPO can deliver substantially higher benefit by using the ex\u2010post funding approach when compared to using a traditional approach that requires the NPO to raise all the funds required upfront.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12633","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['social development', 'public good', 'non-profit', 'donors', 'benefit']","The article discusses the allocation of funds for social development projects aimed at public good, indicating a focus on societal impact rather than purely profit-driven motives.

The funding received and the number of new patients of different health states entering the program in every period could be unpredictable and hence, resource allocation and rationing assume significance in this setting.

We demonstrate that the optimal allocation policy is state dependent, provide analytical results regarding the impact of funding timing and funding variability in our problem context, and develop two heuristics for the inventory allocation problem.

In our model, a bipartite graph describes which subset of signals is accessible to a farmer. We characterize a unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium and express farmers' strategies and expected profits in closed form. We discuss properties of this equilibrium and show that asymmetric information structures can lead to various novel results. For example, a farmer may produce more (less) when observing a pessimistic (optimistic) signal, may benefit from the improvement of a signal she cannot observe, may want to share her signal with others, and may become worse off when another farmer releases a signal to her. We conduct comprehensive studies on the equilibrium in the \u201cweak signal limit,\u201d where signals are subject to substantial noise. We examine the government's optimal information allocation in this limit when its goal is to maximize farmers' total profits or the social welfare.

To date, little is known about the workings and sustenance of NPO\u2010enabled long\u2010term health care delivery in underserved communities, and even less about NPO\u2010enabled surgical care delivery. Further, health care delivery in underserved communities is a context that is often characterized by primitive and poor record keeping, data scarcity and poor data quality. Therefore, conducting research on health care delivery in such contexts is particularly challenging. The central question motivating this study is: How can international NPOs enable the long\u2010term delivery of surgical care in underserved communities? To overcome the data challenges, we use multi\u2010method triangulation as the research design to conduct this study. Specifically, we adopt a grounded theory approach with small sample statistical analysis for empirical validation. We triangulate insights from qualitative and quantitative data analyses to develop and validate an integrative framework for an international NPO\u2010enabled long\u2010term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The setting for this study is Children's HeartLink, an international medical non\u2010profit organization based in the United States, which partners with health care delivery organizations in developing countries to enable the diagnosis and treatment of children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The focus of this study is the Children HeartLink's partnership with the First Hospital of Lanzhou University (FHLU) located in the underserved and impoverished Gansu province of China. In Gansu province, the CHD incidence rate is six times China's average. The time\u2010period of this study is 11\u00a0years, 1998\u20132008. The key contribution of this study is the integrative framework for an international NPO\u2010enabled long\u2010term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The framework demonstrates how an international NPO's efforts related to affordability, provider awareness, and physical access are interdependent, and how the efforts interact and impact the surgical care delivery outcome. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the framework provides new and nuanced insights such as the following: (i) an international NPO's efforts related to affordability (e.g., funding) or provider awareness (e.g., knowledge transfer) alone has limited direct impact on long\u2010term surgical care outcome; (ii) instead of having a direct impact on the volume of surgeries, an international NPO's effort related to affordability moderates (positively interacts with) the positive association between its efforts related to provider awareness and physical access to surgical care delivery infrastructure, thus impacting the volume of surgeries; and (iii) an international NPO's efforts related to provider awareness and physical access are complementary for long\u2010term surgical care delivery \u2013 i.e., the effort related to provider awareness moderates by way of strengthening the positive association between the effort related to physical access and the volume of surgeries.

This study makes an attempt to formalize this issue by examining a stylized two\u2010party supply chain model in which each player maximizes its own profit while making a certain commitment to its partner. We compare five different games between the two supply\u2010chain partners, which reflect different power positions of the players and different levels of commitment.

Thus, the recognition of mutual dependence of the supply chain members needs to be translated into reciprocal concerns.

On the one hand, risk profile information is informative and can improve radiologists\u2019 performance, but on the other hand, it may impair their judgment by introducing biases in mammography interpretation. Therefore, it is important to assess whether and when profile information use translates into improved outcomes. We model the use of profile information in mammography, using a decision theoretic approach and explore the value of profile information using three process design choices: mammography only, unbiased, and biased reading. We estimate the parameters of our model using clinical data and find that using profile information along with the mammography information can achieve a better performance than not using the profile information. However, the better performance is contingent on the weight assigned to the profile information as well as the extent of bias due to profile information. Translating our findings into clinical practice would require properly designed experiments aiming to quantify the effect of the timing and the use of profile information on performance while accounting for radiologist and patient characteristics.

In many applications, each customer segment is associated with a consideration set that represents the set of products that customers in this segment consider for purchase. The firm has to make a decision on what assortment to offer at each point in time without the ability to identify the customer's segment. A linear program called the Choice\u2010based Deterministic Linear Program (CDLP) has been proposed to determine these offer sets. Unfortunately, its size grows exponentially in the number of products and it is NP\u2010hard to solve when the consideration sets of the segments overlap. The Segment\u2010based Deterministic Concave Program with some additional consistency equalities (SDCP+) is an approximation of CDLP that provides an upper bound on CDLP's optimal objective value. SDCP+ can be solved in a fraction of the time required to solve CDLP and often achieves the same optimal objective value. This raises the question under what conditions can one guarantee equivalence of CDLP and SDCP+. In this study, we obtain a structural result to this end, namely that if the segment consideration sets overlap with a certain tree structure or if they are fully nested, CDLP can be equivalently replaced with SDCP+.

The study makes three contributions. First, we show that production hedging, when compared to matching demand with production, can substantially reduce risk both from VaR and conditional\u2010VaR perspectives while increasing expected profit. Our second contribution relates to the optimal pricing decisions. When a firm has pricing flexibility, it is commonly expected that the optimal price would increase under production hedging. Our study, however, shows that production hedging causes the firm to decrease the optimal price below the riskless price in order to benefit from exchange rate fluctuations. The pressure from risk aversion on the optimal price decision is not one directional, and can lead to both an increase and a decrease in price. Third, our work examines the interactions between financial hedging and production hedging. It identifies when financial hedging serves as a complement, and when as a substitute, to production hedging.

Such behavior has been termed \u201cwardrobing.\u201d Restocking fees (partial refunds) can be used to combat wardrobing. However, there is a trade\u2010off involved, since partial refunds will be viewed negatively by consumers who return an item due to a true lack of fit. In this study, we consider how the extent of wardrobing (how many consumers consider such behavior) and the benefit of wardrobing (how much value can be extracted during the trial) impact firm pricing decisions and profits in this retail context. Our results imply that an increase in the extent of wardrobing is most detrimental to profits when the current extent of wardrobing is low. On the contrary, if the extent of wardrobing is already very high, and the benefit of wardrobing to consumers is also high, the retailer can set prices and refunds such that additional wardrobing actually increases firm profits. In a model extension, we show how a retailer can effectively screen wardrobers from ordinary consumers by offering a menu of price/refund pairs, and that such an approach can lead to increased profits if the extent of wardrobing is sufficiently high.

Where there is random yield, production costs as well as holding costs can be reduced by introducing quality inspections, in which defective items are discarded before further production. To achieve the greatest cost savings, it is important to determine the optimal number and positions of these inspections across the production process which, due to several influencing parameters, is not simple. We show how the positions of inspection within a production process influence the safety stock level that is required to buffer against uncertainties due to demand and yield randomness. Our approach is the first one, combining decisions about the number and positions of inspections with inventory control strategies in a warehouse. We achieve a maximum safety stock reduction of more than 30% in our examples, which can be even larger depending on the parameter setting.

In this paper, we study the coordination of inventory and packaging decisions in a retailing environment. Items in an active package have a longer lifetime than those in a regular package and cost more. Customers always pick items with a longer lifetime first. When items with a longer lifetime are out of stock, a portion of customers are willing to buy less fresh items as substitutes. Our study shows the optimality of a \u201cseparation\u201d policy when the substitution rate is high. In the separation policy, as the initial inventory level increases, the optimal policy changes from using active packaging only, then to using regular packaging only, and finally to ordering nothing.

The firm operates an inventory system with multiple demand classes and multiple suppliers. The sales are discretionary and the suppliers are susceptible to both systematic and operational risks.

We characterize the optimal procurement and selling policy, and the strategic relationship between signal\u2010based forecast, multi\u2010sourcing, and discretionary selling.

This work advances our understanding on when and how to use advance supply signals in dynamic risk management. Future supply risk erodes profitability but enhances the marginal value of current inventory. A signal of future supply shortage raises both base stock and demand rationing levels, thereby boosting the current production and tightening the current sales. Signal\u2010based dynamic forecast effectively guides the firm's procurement and selling decisions. Its value critically depends on supply volatility and scarcity. Ignoring advance supply signals can result in misleading recommendations and severe losses.

We find that bundling vertically differentiated products can significantly improve profits, even if consumers do not benefit from consuming the components jointly.

Although the problem has drawn tremendous attention from the government and media, limited academic research has been devoted to this problem, and few solutions have been proposed based on rigorous research. This study addresses the drug shortage problem from a supply chain perspective, a key aspect missing in the literature, and proposes to mitigate shortages through drug purchase contracts. By modeling the drug supply chain, we capture the objectives of various supply chain parties, and investigate Pareto\u2010improving contracts that mitigate drug shortages, improve drug manufacturer's and group purchasing organization (GPO)'s profits, and cut government spending and healthcare providers\u2019 costs. We explore structural properties of key supply chain decisions and the Pareto\u2010improving contracts, and conduct scenario analysis with realistic industry data to evaluate shortage mitigation solutions. Our analysis shows that increasing drug prices only, a solution advocated by many, is not very effective in shortage mitigation. Price increases must be paired with strengthened failure\u2010to\u2010supply clauses (called the IPS approach) to achieve consistent and significant shortage reduction as well as Pareto improvement. Across all scenarios tested, a 30% price increase under IPS can lead to a minimum, average, and maximum shortage reduction of 25%, 53%, and 70%, respectively. Our analysis also shows the impacts of IPS on different parties in the supply chain and the impacts of various model parameters on shortage mitigation. The IPS approach rewards reliability of drug supply, which is in line with the FDA's strategic plan to reward quality, but is easier to achieve in this regulation\u2010based industry.

Consider a case where a firm produces and sells two products. Without discretionary commonality, each product is made through a unique combination of input and production capacity. With discretionary commonality, one of the inputs could be used for producing both products, and one of the production capacities could be used to process different inputs for producing one of the products. In the latter case, the manager can decide, upon the realization of uncertainty, not only the quantities for different products (outputs) but also the means of transforming inputs into outputs. The objective of this study is to understand how the firm's value, its inventory levels for inputs and capacity levels for resources are affected by the demand characteristics and market conditions. In pursuing this research, we extend Van Mieghem and Rudi (2002)'s newsvendor network model to allow for the modeling of product interdependence, demand functions, random shocks, and firm's ex post pricing decision. Applying the general framework to the network with discretionary commonality, we discover that inventory and capacity management can be quite different compared to a network where commonality is non\u2010discretionary. Among other results, we find that as the degree of product substitution increases, the relative need for discretionary commonality increases; as the market correlation increases, while the firm's value may increase for complementary products, the discretionary common input decreases but the dedicated input increases.

Our formulation considers the cost structures of the two strategies, uncertainty in the input quality of the collected/returned used products, consumer willingness\u2010to\u2010pay for remanufactured product, the extent to which the remanufactured product cannibalizes demand for a new product, and the power structure in the channel. For the profit\u2010maximizing retailer, the differentials in variable remanufacturing costs drive strategy choice, and higher fixed costs of in\u2010house remanufacturing favors outsourcing. The variable remanufacturing costs and the balance of power in the prospective outsourced reverse channel are the key drivers of environmental impact, as measured by the retailer's propensity to remanufacture. While profitability and environmental goals often conflict, they align under certain conditions. These include (a) the third party has less bargaining power; or (b) the fixed cost for in\u2010house remanufacturing is relatively high. All else equal, when remanufacturing is outsourced, the environment fares better if the third party has leadership power. We generalize to the cases when remanufacturing achieves a quality level less than \u201cgood\u2010as\u2010new\" and when used items have non\u2010zero salvage value. Analysis of these extensions illuminates how relative power in the reverse channel drives the firms\u2019 preferences, as well as the end customers\u2019 consumption experience.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12709","research article","POM","Operations Management","6","['environment', 'profit-maximization', 'remanufacturing', 'sustainability']","The article discusses the conflict between profit-maximization and environmental goals, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical considerations in operations management.

A transportation facility visits the station according to a renewal process and serves all present customers at each visit. We assume that every customer maximizes her individual expected utility and the administrator is a profit maximizer. We model this situation as a two\u2010stage game among the customers and the administrator, where customer strategies depend on the level of delay information provided by the administrator. We consider three cases distinguished by the level of delay information: observable (the exact waiting time is announced), unobservable (no information is provided) and partially observable (the number of waiting customers is announced). In each case, we explore how the customer reward for service, the unit waiting cost, and the intervisit time distribution parameters affect the customer behavior and the fee imposed by the administrator. We then compare the three cases and show that the customers almost always prefer to know their exact waiting times whereas the administrator prefers to provide either no information or the exact waiting time depending on system parameters.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12706","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of customer behavior and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When a substance of concern is identified (e.g., bisphenol\u2010A (BPA) in reusable water bottles), manufacturers face difficult trade\u2010offs in deciding whether to proactively replace the substance in their products or to defer replacement and wait to see if regulation occurs. In this study, we examine when opportunities exist for manufacturers to avoid competitively replacing (i.e., making their replacement decisions on their own), and instead, collaborate to replace a substance of concern. We model a vertically differentiated market consisting of a high\u2010end manufacturer and a low\u2010end manufacturer, both of whom sell a product that contains a substance of concern. Our analysis investigates how market dynamics (competition and consumer preferences) and external factors (replacement costs and regulatory uncertainty) influence manufacturers' collaboration, replacement, and pricing decisions. We find that when the manufacturers do not collaborate, the high\u2010end manufacturer can use the presence of a substance of concern to dominate the market by capturing more demand and often charging a higher price for his product than the low\u2010end manufacturer. Collaboration is possible when there is either a shared fixed cost savings for both manufacturers or an opportunity for the low\u2010end manufacturer to benefit his competitive position by motivating the high\u2010end manufacturer to collaborate. From a consumer perspective, although collaboration reduces consumer exposure to the substance of concern, it can decrease consumer surplus when the replacement substance is very expensive.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12710","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['substance of concern', 'collaboration', 'consumer exposure', 'regulatory uncertainty']","The article discusses the implications of replacing harmful substances in products, highlighting regulatory concerns and consumer safety, which aligns with moderate woke themes of ethical practices and social responsibility in operations management."],["2017","26","9","Weili Xue, Ozgun Caliskan Demirag, [\u2026], Frank Y.

Empirical evidence from the retail industry shows that for some types of products, higher levels of on\u2010shelf inventory have a demand\u2010increasing effect (\u201cbillboard effect\u201d) while for some other types of products, higher levels of on\u2010shelf inventory have a demand\u2010decreasing effect (\u201cscarcity effect\u201d). This suggests that retailers may use the amount of shelf stock on display as a tool to influence demand and operate a store backroom to hold the inventory of items not displayed on the shelves, introducing the need for efficient management of the backroom and on\u2010shelf inventories. The purpose of this study is to address such an issue by considering a periodic\u2010review inventory system in which demand in each period is stochastic and depends on the amount of inventory displayed on the shelf. We first analyze the problem in a finite\u2010horizon setting and show under a general demand model that the system inventory is optimally replenished by a base\u2010stock policy and the shelf stock is controlled by two critical points representing the target levels to raise up/drop down the on\u2010shelf inventory level. In the infinite\u2010horizon setting, we find that the optimal policies simplify to stationary base\u2010stock type policies. Under the billboard effect, we further show that the optimal policy is monotone in the system states. Numerical experiments illustrate the value of smart backroom management strategy and show that significant profit gains can be obtained by jointly managing the backroom and on\u2010shelf inventories.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12713","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on inventory management and demand effects without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

From a medical perspective, the number of patients being admitted should depend solely on the patients\u2019 clinical conditions. Using a large\u2010scale econometric study that includes detailed operational and clinical data on all cardiac patient encounters from a set of 128 hospitals over a period of four years, we show that this is not the case. In particular, we find that independent of their medical condition, many emergency patients are denied hospital admission because of a lack of inpatient beds. Our analysis suggests that having one more inpatient bed at the start of a day can increase the likelihood of an emergency room patient admission by around 3% on average. We examine two policies \u2013 active discharge and demand smoothing \u2013 that can help hospitals improve patient access. We find that some hospitals actively discharge inpatients when beds become scarce; hospitals that follow such an active discharge protocol are, on average, able to admit more patients. We also investigate to what extent the hospital's ability to smooth its surgical schedule impacts hospital admissions. Hospitals tend to schedule their elective patients early in the week (Mondays and Tuesdays), and discharge them by the weekend in order to minimize weekend staffing, effectively maximizing bed occupancy during the middle of the week. This \u201cweekend effect\u201d artificially induces variability, and reduces effective system capacity. We find that by scheduling patients more uniformly over the week, hospitals can dramatically increase patient access, obviating the need for active discharges or additional capacity investment. Our analysis quantifies these effects, and can help hospitals make effective capacity management decisions in order to improve patient flow.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12714","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['patient access', 'admission', 'capacity management']","The article discusses patient access and hospital admission policies, which touch on healthcare equity but primarily focus on operational efficiency rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

In a classic horizontal product\u2010differentiation framework, a consumer's utility is a decreasing function of the distance between their ideal taste and the taste defined by the most closely aligned product the firm offers. A consumer thus considers the taste mismatch associated with their purchased product, but otherwise the positioning of the firm's product portfolio (or, \u201cbrand image\u201d) is immaterial. In contrast, self\u2010congruency theory suggests that consumers assess how well both the purchased product and its overall brand image match with their ideal taste. Therefore, we incorporate within the consumer utility function both product\u2010specific and brand\u2010level components. Mass customization has the potential to improve taste alignment with regard to a specific purchased product, but at the risk of increasing brand dilution. Absent brand dilution concerns, a firm will optimally serve all consumers\u2019 ideal tastes at a single price. In contrast, by endogenizing dilution costs within the consumer utility model, we prove that a mass\u2010customizing firm optimally uses differential pricing. Moreover, we show that the firm offers reduced prices to consumers with extreme tastes (to stimulate consumer \u201ctravel\u201d), with a higher and fixed price being offered to those consumers having more central (mainstream) tastes. Given that a continuous spectrum of prices will likely not be practical in application, we also consider the more pragmatic approach of augmenting the uniformly priced mass customization range with preset (non\u2010customized) outlying designs, which serve customers at the taste extremes. We prove this practical approach performs close to optimal.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12716","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['customization', 'consumer', 'brand image']","The article discusses mass customization and consumer preferences but lacks a strong focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Each node follows a base\u2010stock policy and a first\u2010come, first\u2010served allocation policy. We develop two heuristics, the recursive optimization (RO) heuristic and the decomposition\u2010aggregation (DA) heuristic, to approximate the optimal base\u2010stock levels of all the locations in the system. The RO heuristic applies a bottom\u2010up approach that sequentially solves single\u2010variable, convex problems for each location. The DA heuristic decomposes the distribution system into multiple serial systems, solves for the base\u2010stock levels of these systems using the newsvendor heuristic of Shang and Song (2003), and then aggregates the serial systems back into the distribution system using a procedure we call \u201cbackorder matching.\u201d A key advantage of the DA heuristic is that it does not require any evaluation of the cost function (a computationally costly operation that requires numerical convolution). We show that, for both RO and DA, changing some of the parameters, such as leadtime, unit backordering cost, and demand rate, of a location has an impact only on its own local base\u2010stock level and its upstream locations\u2019 local base\u2010stock levels. An extensive numerical study shows that both heuristics perform well, with the RO heuristic providing more accurate results and the DA heuristic consuming less computation time. We show that both RO and DA are asymptotically optimal along multiple dimensions for two\u2010echelon distribution systems. Finally, we show that, with minor changes, both RO and DA are applicable to the balanced allocation policy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12717","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory optimization and distribution systems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When both products are available, customers will buy the one that gives them a higher (and non\u2010negative) utility. Thus, if the firm does not price the products properly, then product cannibalization may arise and its revenue may be adversely impacted. In this paper, we study the pricing problem of a firm that sells both new and remanufactured products over a finite planning horizon. Customer demand processes for both new and remanufactured products are random and price\u2010sensitive, and product returns (also called cores) are random and remanufactured upon receipt. We characterize the optimal pricing and manufacturing policies that maximize the expected total discounted profit. If new products are made\u2010to\u2010order (MTO), we show that when the inventory level of remanufactured product increases, the optimal price of remanufactured product decreases while the price difference between new and remanufactured products increases; however, the optimal selling price of new product may increase or decrease. If new products are made to stock (MTS), then the optimal manufacturing policy is of a base\u2010stock policy with the base\u2010stock level decreasing in the remanufactured product inventory level. To understand the potential benefit in implementing an MTO system, we study the difference between the value functions of the MTO and MTS systems, and develop lower and upper bounds for it. Finally, we study several extensions of the base model and show that most of our results extend to those more general settings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12724","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['environmental', 'remanufactured', 'sustainability']","The article discusses remanufactured products and environmental reasons, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability.

Simply maximizing this total, however, may lead to undesirable schedules since some requests have higher priority than others. For example, it might be better to grant one resident's request for a family member's wedding in place of two residents\u2019 requests to attend a rugby game. Another approach is to assign a weight to each request and maximize the total weight of granted requests, but determining weights that accurately represent residents\u2019 and schedulers\u2019 preferences can be quite challenging. Instead, we propose to identify the exhaustive collection of maximally feasible and minimally infeasible sets of requests which can then be used by schedulers to select their preferred solution. Specifically, we have developed two algorithms, which we call Sequential Request Selection Via Cuts (Sequential RSVC) and Simultaneous Request Selection Via Cuts (Simultaneous RSVC), to identify these sets by solving two sequences of optimization problems. We present these algorithms along with computational results based on a real\u2010world problem of scheduling residents at the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Pediatric Emergency Department.

Retailers make significant investments in marketing activities (such as advertising) to bring customers into their stores and in\u2010store labor to convert that traffic into sales. Thus, a common trade\u2010off that retail store managers face concerns the allocation of a store's limited budget between advertising and labor to enhance store\u2010level sales. To explore that trade\u2010off, we develop a centralized model to allocate limited store budget between store labor and advertising with the objective of maximizing store sales. We find that a store's inherent potential to drive traffic plays an important role, among other factors, in the relative allocation between advertising and store labor. We also find that as advertising instruments become more effective in bringing traffic to stores, managers should not always capitalize this effectiveness by increasing their existing allocations to advertising. In addition, we discuss a decentralized setting where budget\u00a0allocation decisions cannot be enforced by a store manager and present a simple mechanism that can achieve the centralized solution. In an extension, we address the budget\u00a0allocation problem in the presence of marketing efforts to shift store traffic from peak to off peak hours and show that our initial findings are robust. Further, we illustrate how the solution from the budget\u00a0allocation model can be used to facilitate store level sales force planning/scheduling decisions. Based on the results of our model, we present several insights that can help managers in budget\u00a0allocation and sales force planning.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12733","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of budget allocation and sales optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Refinancing and the Blocking Power of Second MortgagesGet access","In most U.S. states, mortgage seniority follows time priority: older mortgages are paid first. This potentially impedes refinancing of senior mortgages because replacement mortgages are junior unless the existing junior lienholders consent to resubordination. We exploit legal variation across states to provide evidence that time priority reduces refinancing, especially of smaller mortgages (suggesting a significant fixed cost of obtaining resubordination) and of mortgages close to the conforming loan limit. On the contrary, we find evidence that time priority renders second mortgages more valuable to lenders, increasing the likelihood that a borrower obtains a second mortgage.Received May 20, 2013; editorial decision June 8, 2016 by Editor Laura Starks","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/1/211/2528255","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mortgage refinancing and legal variations without addressing any social justice themes, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We develop new measures of asset redeployability by accounting for the usability of assets within and across industries. We identify plausibly exogenous shocks to economic uncertainty by using major economic and political events. We find that after an increase in uncertainty, firms using less redeployable capital reduce investment more. More redeployable assets exhibit higher recovery rates and are traded more actively in secondary markets. Overall, our results suggest that frictions in redeploying assets affect liquidation values and therefore make firms cautious about investment decisions under uncertainty.Received August 29, 2014; accepted July 13, 2016, by Editor Itay Goldstein.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/1/245/2669940","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate investment and asset redeployability without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

Consequently, in incomplete asset markets, monetary policy can affect housing investment and the economy through the cost of new mortgage borrowing and real payments on outstanding debt. These channels, distinct from the traditional real rate channel, are embedded in a general equilibrium model. The transmission mechanism is stronger under adjustable-rate mortgages compared with fixed-rate mortgages. Further, persistent monetary policy shocks affecting the level of the nominal yield curve have larger real effects compared with transitory shocks.

Using a proprietary data set of public and private firms, this paper shows that firms with higher pay inequality\u2014relative wage differentials between top- and bottom-level jobs\u2014are larger and have higher valuations and stronger operating performance. Moreover, firms with higher pay inequality exhibit larger equity returns and greater earnings surprises, suggesting that pay inequality is not fully priced by the market.

An additional modification reduces loan losses by 35.8% relative to the average loss; this reduction suggests that the marginal benefit of modification likely exceeded the marginal cost.

Highly affected commercial banks increase lending by 2% to 3% relative to their counterparts. QE2 had no significant impact, consistent with its exclusive focus on Treasuries sparsely held by banks.

This number is the same as the number of assets. Our nonlinear shrinkage estimator is asymptotically optimal for portfolio selection when the number of assets is of the same magnitude as the sample size.

Additional analyses suggest that the volume effect on stock return is likely caused by mispricing, not by compensation for illiquidity.Received September 20, 2014; editorial decision April 16, 2017 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/12/4481/3954040","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the pricing of the Amihud measure and trading volume, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The model generates high international correlation of state prices along with modest cross-country consumption growth correlation and matches the empirical disconnect between exchange rate changes and consumption growth rate differentials. The key mechanism is endogenous time variation in conditional consumption growth volatility: the conditionally less risk averse country insures the more risk averse one, offsetting cross-country heterogeneity in conditional risk aversion and leading to significant international comovement in marginal utility growth.Received February 1, 2012; editorial decision April 19, 2016 by Editor Pietro Veronesi.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/2/363/2444495","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model related to asset prices and risk sharing without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

Moreover, we derive novel bounds for the SDF that are tighter and have higher information content than existing ones.

We derive a three-fund separation strategy: the investor allocates wealth to a risk-free asset, a standard mean-variance efficient fund, and an additional fund reflecting return asymmetries. The optimal portfolio is characterized by the investor\u2019s endogenous effective risk aversion and implicit asymmetry aversion. In empirical applications, we find that disappointment aversion is associated with much larger asymmetry aversion than are standard preferences.

Our analysis exploits persistent and externally imposed differences in court enforcement that arose when the U.S. Congress assigned state courts to adjudicate contracts on a subset of Native American reservations. Using area-specific data on small business lending, we find that reservations assigned to state courts, which enforce contracts more predictably than tribal courts, have stronger credit markets. Moreover, the law-driven component of credit market development is associated with significantly higher per capita income, with stronger effects in sectors that depend more on external financing.Received April 24, 2015; accepted March 7, 2016 by Editor Robin Greenwood.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/3/1019/2669944","articles","RFS","Finance","3","['legal institutions', 'Native American', 'credit markets']","The article discusses the impact of legal institutions on financial markets, particularly in the context of Native American reservations, which introduces a social dimension.

By using the dispersion of inflation forecasts to measure this uncertainty, we find the opposite. Since the prices of long-term bonds move more with inflation than short-term ones, investors also disagree and speculate more about long-maturity payoffs with greater uncertainty. Shorting frictions, measured by using Treasury lending fees, then lead long maturities to become overpriced and the yield curve to flatten.

These spillovers arise only within the boundaries of a conglomerate. The intra-firm spillovers increase when conglomerates have excess cash and when managers have more influence over its distribution, but decline in the presence of strong governance. These spillovers are associated with weaker performance and lower firm value. Our evidence is consistent with simultaneous cross-subsidization via managerial compensation and capital budgets and suggests that these practices arise in similar firms.Received March 19, 2015; editorial decision August 30, 2016 by Editor Francesca Cornelli.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/5/1696/2454737","articles","RFS","Finance","2","['spillovers', 'managerial compensation', 'governance']","The article focuses on financial mechanisms within conglomerates and does not address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We characterize the optimal contract using the dynamic programming technique in which information rent is the unique state variable. In the optimal contract, the optimal effort is front-loaded and stochastically decreases over time. Furthermore, the optimal contract exhibits an option-like feature in that incentives increase after good performance.

Using industry-level IPO waves as a proxy for increased competition for CEOs, I find that pay-size elasticity increases by 6% with a one-standard-deviation increase in IPO activity. This effect is stronger in specialized industries. In addition, increased IPO activity leads to a greater likelihood of executive transitions between firms.

The effect of increasing debtor protection depends on the entrepreneur\u2019s level of wealth. Firms owned by mid-wealth entrepreneurs whose assets become fully protected suffer a reduction in credit availability, employment, operating efficiency, and survival rates. We find no such negative effects for low-wealth and high-wealth owners.

The estimation identifies inflation as procyclical from the late 1990s, when the economy shifted toward aggressive monetary policy and experienced procyclical macroeconomics shocks. Since bonds hedge stock market risks when inflation is procylical, the stock-bond return correlation turned negative in the late 1990s.

This situation is problematic for valuing real commodity-linked assets. We estimate a nonlinear four-factor continuous time model of commodity price dynamics. The model nests many previous specifications. To estimate the model, we use crude oil prices and inventories. The inventory data and nonlinear price dynamics have a large impact on oil price forecasts. The additional factor in our model compared with current three-factor models has a significant impact on model-implied long-maturity futures prices.Received November 23, 2015; editorial decision September 12, 2016 by Editor Geert Bekaert.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/8/2818/2682976","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance related to commodity pricing without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Disappointment Events in Consumption Growth and Equilibrium Asset PricesGet access","I propose a consumption-based asset pricing model with disappointment aversion to investigate the link between downside consumption risk and expected returns across asset markets. I find that the disappointment model can explain 95% of the cross-sectional variation in size/book-to-market portfolios and more than 80% of the variation in the joint sample of stocks, bonds, and commodity futures. I also show that the performance of the disappointment model is comparable to that of the Fama-French three-factor specification, regardless of the sample frequency (annual, quarterly). Overall, my results indicate that disappointment aversion considerably improves the fit of consumption-based asset pricing models.Received November 27, 2014; editorial decision September 18, 2016 by Editor Stefan Nagel.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/8/2851/2996208","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a consumption-based asset pricing model and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

The model also generates endogenous consumption volatility risk. Precautionary savings motives make consumption sensitive to shocks in bad times, leading to countercyclical volatility, even with homoscedastic technology shocks. Habit acts as countercyclical leverage, which amplifies this channel.

These engagements perform strikingly better than single activist engagements. Engagement outcomes, such as board changes and takeovers, vary across countries and significantly contribute to the returns to activism.

We identify conditions on the shock distribution under which full integration or maximal segmentation is optimal. We also show that, under different conditions, the optimal network displays different levels of strength of linkages to other firms or intermediate degrees of segmentation. In the latter case, the individual and social incentives to establish linkages are not necessarily aligned. When firms face heterogeneous distributions of risks, they should optimally form linkages only with firms facing risks of the same kind.Received November 8, 2014; editorial decision April 28, 2017 by Editor Itay Goldstein.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/9/3086/3964630","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of financial networks and risk management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We use the resulting typology of six distinct nonmarket strategies to provide an integrative review of nonmarket strategy research. We then extend this framework to examine the choice between nonmarket strategies, arguing that this choice depends upon whether the existing institutional environment is incomplete or captured, and discussing other drivers of nonmarket strategy choice, the relationship between these strategies, and their social impact, so as to provide an agenda for future research.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2590","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['social impact', 'institutional environment', 'collaboration']","The article discusses the social impact of nonmarket strategies and the role of institutions, which indicates a moderate focus on ethical considerations and social dynamics in business practices.

The costs associated with strategy modifications, which we term \u201crepositioning costs,\u201d are particularly relevant to competitive interactions involving major changes to business strategies. Repositioning costs can critically affect competitive dynamics and, consequently, the implications of strategic interaction for strategic choice. While the literature broadly recognizes the importance of such costs, game-theoretic treatments of major strategic change, with very limited exceptions, have not addressed them meaningfully. We advocate greater recognition of repositioning costs and illustrate with two simple models how repositioning costs may facilitate differentiation and affect the value of a firm's capability to reduce repositioning costs through investments in flexibility.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2635","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on modeling competitive interactions and repositioning costs without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A Network Embeddedness Perspective of Executive Ship Jumping in Declining Firms","Research summary: Executives in declining firms may engage in ship-jumping behavior (i.e., voluntarily move to new employers before the failure occurs) to avoid the stigma of failure. However, it is unclear how executives decide whether or not to jump ship. Building on a network embeddedness perspective, we highlight how three network-based indicators (i.e., executive social capital, the social capital of other peers in the declining firm, and the declining firm's alliance network) influence the executive-level ship-jumping decision by shaping its benefits and opportunity costs. Using data from executives at failing firms in China, we find support for our hypothesized relationships.

Using a sample of U.S. S&P 1,500 firm CEOs, we find that CEOs engage in more intensive acquisition activities in the period after their competitors won CEO awards (i.e., postaward period), compared to the preaward period. Moreover, this effect is stronger when focal CEOs themselves had a high likelihood of winning CEO awards. Our findings also show that acquisitions by focal CEO firms in the postaward period realize lower announcement returns compared to acquisitions by the same CEOs in the preaward period.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2638","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['CEO', 'acquisition', 'social recognition']","The article primarily focuses on the competitive behaviors of CEOs in relation to awards, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The Effects of Corporate Reputation on Firm Value at the Onset of a Corporate Crisis","Research summary: We study how two dimensions of reputation (i.e., generalized favorability and being known) and attribution of crisis responsibility affect firm value at the onset of a crisis. Analyzing 126 corporate crises befalling publicly listed firms in China from 2008 to 2014, we find that generalized favorability serves as a buffer, while being known can be a burden, in influencing firm value. We also find that the buffering effect of generalized favorability is stronger when the attribution of crisis responsibility is low (vs. high). In addition, there is a negative interaction effect between the two dimensions of reputation such that the buffering effect of generalized favorability weakens when firms are better known. We discuss our contributions to research on corporate reputation and crisis management.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2639","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['corporate reputation', 'crisis responsibility', 'firm value']","The article primarily focuses on corporate reputation and its impact on firm value during crises, lacking a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Because a firm's technological investments in nascent industries typically occur before market entry, this study makes a distinction between firm capabilities at the time of market entry and at the time of initial investment. At the time of market entry, core technical capabilities and complementary assets influence the likelihood of entry. However, at the time of investment, a firm's integrative capabilities as well as the initial stocks of related technical capabilities and complementary assets become critical, as they enable endogenous development of core technical capabilities and complementary assets by the time of entry.

The result is an inverted-U relationship between variety and productivity: When the firm offers few additional categories, productivity grows, but as the number of categories rises, the costs of executing the operational routines increase rapidly and productivity falls. The negative effect on productivity increases if the added product category is more dissimilar to previous ones, and decreases with learning from operational experience. Our results highlight how frictions at the operational level can limit the benefits of diversification, even in the absence of other sources of diseconomies, such as increased coordination needs.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2643","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiencies and productivity related to product diversification without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Since firms' growth rate influences employees' promotion opportunities, the growth rate can have significant implications for the incentives employees face. Rapid growth, by creating more promotion opportunities, motivates employees to engage in extra-role behaviors that might result in promotion should an opportunity arise. Building on this argument, we develop a formal model linking the design of firms' incentive structure to their rate of growth. The associated dynamics lead to three distinct epochs of firms' lifecycle: rapid growth and high-powered incentives driven by frequent promotion opportunities; moderate growth with infrequent promotion opportunities, but large salary increases contingent on promotion; and finally, stagnant firms with low-powered incentives.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2644","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['employee incentives', 'firm growth', 'promotion opportunities']","The article primarily focuses on the economic aspects of firm growth and employee incentives without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet, this research remains unclear on how high-reputation firms do so.

What kind of acquisitions do they make? How do investors react to high-reputation firms' differential acquisition behaviors? We find that high-reputation firms make more acquisitions and more unrelated acquisitions than other firms. Yet, we also find that investors bid down high-reputation firms' stock more than other firms' in response to acquisition announcements, suggesting that investors are skeptical of how high-reputation firms maintain their reputations.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2645","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['reputation', 'acquisitions', 'investors']","The article focuses primarily on the behaviors of high-reputation firms in relation to acquisitions and investor reactions, lacking a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

While research suggests firm financial performance is the primary driver of CEO dismissal, we propose that CSR will provide important additional context when interpreting a firm's financial performance. Consistent with this prediction, our results suggest that past CSR decisions amplify the negative relationship between financial performance and CEO dismissal. Specifically, we find that greater prior investments in CSR appear to expose CEOs of firms with poor financial performance to a greater risk of dismissal. In contrast, greater past investments in CSR appear to help shield CEOs of firms with good financial performance from dismissal. These findings provide novel insight into how CEOs' career outcomes may be affected by earlier CSR decisions.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2646","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['corporate social responsibility', 'financial performance', 'CEO dismissal']","The article discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its impact on CEO dismissal, indicating a moderate engagement with ethical business practices.

We posit that media coverage of CSI generates risk by providing conditions that increase the potential for stakeholder sanctions. Through analyzing an international panel of 539 firms during 2008\u20132013, we find that firms receiving higher CSI coverage face higher financial risk. We show that the reach of the reporting media outlet is a critical condition for this relationship. Once the outlet has a high reach, the severity of CSI coverage is a boundary condition that further reinforces the effect. Our findings complement existing theory about the risk-mitigating effect of corporate social responsibility by illuminating the risk-generating effect of CSI coverage.

Yet, they also contain many firms that have survived over generations. How are firms in weak institutional environments able to persist over time? Motivated by 69 interviews with leaders of emerging market firms with histories spanning generations, we combine induction and deduction to propose reputation as a meta-resource that allows firms to activate their conventional resources. We conceptualize reputation as consisting of prominence, perceived quality, and resilience, and develop a process model that illustrates the mechanisms that allow reputation to facilitate survival in ways that persist over time. Building on research in strategy and business history, we thus shed light on an underappreciated strategic construct (reputation) in an undertheorized setting (emerging markets) over an unusual period (the historical long run).","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2649","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['reputation', 'emerging markets', 'survival']","The article discusses the survival of firms in weak institutional environments, which touches on the challenges faced by businesses in emerging markets.

Our empirical results enrich the emerging capability perspective on alliance portfolios, point to the relevance of conceptualizing focal firms in alliance portfolio research as polylithic entities instead of monolithic ones, and provide new insights into how firms create value by potentially recombining externally accessed knowledge.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2652","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of alliance portfolios and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I argue that the sudden dissolution of rival firms may release resources that create opportunities for firm formation, particularly among employees facing impediments to capturing value in their current organizations. Analyzing microdata from the legal services industry, I use unexpected deaths of solo-practicing attorneys as quasi-exogenous sources of rival dissolution. Results indicate that these shocks increase the odds of founding by about 30%, with stronger effects among attorneys with weaker social connections or higher competition for promotion. The article thus highlights the role that founders play in reallocating dissolved rivals' resources while demonstrating that founding may be an important outlet for \u201cblocked\u201d employees to capture value from opportunities.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2653","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['opportunities', 'employees', 'blocked', 'founding']","The article discusses how competitive shocks can create opportunities for firm formation, particularly for employees who are 'blocked' in their current organizations.

This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with inter-temporal economies of scope, diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most-related businesses. That effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses. The strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business, volatilities of business returns, and correlation of those returns. This study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations, encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2654","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate diversification and resource management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Firms' Disclosure During Standard Setting and Complementary Technologies Within Ecosystems","Research summary: Within an ecosystem, standard setting coordinates development of complementary technologies across firms. But each firm can itself own multiple of these complementary technologies. We study how a firm's own complementary technologies influence its disclosure inclination during standard setting. We identify a tradeoff: disclosure increases value-creation of the firm's non-disclosed complementary technologies, but also heightens expropriation risk. Using data on the U.S. communications equipment industry 1991\u20132008, we show that the firm's complementary technologies increase its disclosure inclination when its technological areas are less crowded, but decrease such inclination when there are SSO members with strong expropriation abilities. Findings stress that disclosure involves but a piece of the firm's portfolio; a systemic perspective of the entire portfolio provides a more comprehensive picture of value-creation during standard setting.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2655","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['disclosure', 'value-creation', 'expropriation']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of disclosure and value creation in firms without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that U.S. plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). Consistent with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, goods imported by U.S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries. U.S. plants shift production to less pollution-intensive industries, produce less waste, and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from LWCs. The negative impact of LWC imports on emissions is stronger for U.S. plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance, but weaker for more-capable U.S. plants and firms. These results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capability in explaining firms' offshoring and environmental strategies.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2656","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['pollution', 'environmental performance', 'toxic emissions', 'firm strategy']","The article addresses the environmental impact of offshoring production, emphasizing pollution and environmental performance, which aligns with socially responsible themes.

We identify an impression management technique we call foreshadowing, which refers to hinting about future potential strategic activity. Foreshadowing provides information of value to analysts that can influence their evaluations of a firm, but not so much information as to put the firm at a competitive disadvantage. We hypothesize and find that managers who foreshadow acquisition announcements receive fewer analyst downgrades following the announcements, especially when there is more analyst uncertainty about the firm. We also hypothesize and find that analysts' responses to foreshadowing positively influence the likelihood that managers eventually acquire other firms.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2659","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on impression management techniques in a competitive business context without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

Using incentivized experiments, we measure the constructs in participants, then let them compete for cash in a highly competitive market. Although the market is designed to eliminate any advantages, whether from market structure or strategic resources, some profit much more than others.

A Mechanisms-Based, Policy-Capturing Analysis","Research summary: While alliance researchers view prior partner-specific alliance experience as influencing firms' subsequent alliance or acquisition decisions, empirical evidence on the alliance versus acquisition decision is surprisingly mixed. We offer a reconciliation by proposing and testing an analytical framework that recognizes prior partner-specific experiences as heterogeneous along three fundamental dimensions: partner-specific trust, routines, and value certainty. This allows us to use a policy-capturing methodology to rigorously operationalize and test our mechanism-level predictions. We find that all three mechanisms can increase the likelihood of a subsequent alliance or acquisition, and in terms of the comparative choice between alliances versus acquisitions, partner-specific trust pulls towards alliances, and value certainty pulls towards acquisitions.

Yet, studies showing that MMC can increase the threat of imitation suggest a need to better understand how MMC affects upstream rivalry over knowledge-based resources. In this study, we argue that MMC increases rivalry over knowledge-based resources since the deterrent threat of retaliation that typically leads to mutual forbearance in downstream activities will not be sufficient to restrain firms from protecting their knowledge from imitation in upstream activities. In support of these arguments we find that MMC increases the likelihood that a firm initiates patent litigation against a rival.

Building on literature in strategy and organizational theory, we test a model of peripheral entry and growth in the mainstream market segment. Using data from 289 craft breweries over 11 years, we find evidence that niche producers are increasingly entering the mainstream market and competing with market-center firms. We identify two mechanisms contributing to these actions: legitimacy transfer and cognitive claims of authenticity. As hypothesized, imitation of niche products by macro breweries facilitates craft beer entry into mainstream markets. Moreover, two authenticity-based identity codes are found to reliably influence craft brewery growth: a local identity (i.e., operating in one's local market) and a product proliferator identity (i.e., offering a more diverse set of products).","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2681","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['authenticity', 'diverse', 'local identity']","The article discusses themes of authenticity and local identity, which suggest a moderate focus on social and cultural aspects of business practices.

Federal Election Commission and subsequent developments created a covert channel for firms to allocate resources from corporate treasuries to political activity. Through the use of a financial market event study of an accidental disclosure of firms' contributions to a Republican nonprofit organization, I examine investors' reactions to covert investment in independent political expenditures. I find that, on average, contributing firms experienced positive abnormal returns around the disclosure event and that these abnormal returns were more positive for firms in heavily regulated industries as well as those previously making campaign contributions to candidates.

We observe a unique natural experiment in a South Korean e-commerce company in which a switch from pay-for-performance to fixed (but different) salaries took place in a staggered and effectively random manner across employees. In this case, social and individual effects perspectives make opposing predictions, enabling a critical test. We find evidence consistent with social effects of incentives, particularly as predicted by goal framing theory.

These analogies shape how executives construe the future and influence attitudes to action with long-term benefits but short-term costs. Ego-moving frames (\u201cwe are approaching the future\u201d) prompt a focus on the present, whereas time-moving frames (\u201cthe future is approaching\u201d) underscore the advent of the future as inevitable. Ultimately, action that prioritizes long-term returns depends both on how executives conceive of the future and whether they believe they can engender favorable outcomes. This balance between recognizing the inevitability of the future (time-moving frame) and the capacity to shape outcomes (control beliefs) stands in contrast to the more agentic forms of discourse that are dominant in strategy.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2687","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['executives', 'future', 'long-term', 'action', 'control beliefs']","The article focuses on strategic decision-making and the conceptual framing of time in business contexts, with no explicit mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

To operationalize strategic management theory under demand, technological and competitive uncertainty, we develop a Strategic Net Present Value (NPV) framework that integrates real options and game theory to quantify value components and interactions at the interface between NPV, real options, and strategic games. Our approach results in new propositions clarifying the way learning-experience conditions, technological uncertainty, and proprietary information interact to tilt the balance in the interplay between wait-and-see flexibility and strategic commitment. As such, Strategic NPV adds to our understanding of the conditions where NPV, real options, or strategic thinking are more relevant.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2665","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of strategic management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2017","38","13","Umit Ozmel,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Umit Ozmel\n                     \n                        uozmelya@purdue.edu\n                     \n                     Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IndianaCorrespondence to: Umit Ozmel, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2506.

However, little research has examined the relative risk of technological exits for startups vs. diversifying entrants in such \u201cdominance battles.\u201d We develop a contingency framework that links a firm's technology exit to its pre-entry experience and the characteristics of the dominance battle. With a sample of 134 technologies involved in 31 dominance battles in the information technology industry from 1979 to 2007, we show that technologies of startups were more likely than those of diversifying entrants to exit from platform technology-based dominance battles; however, this relationship did not exist in non-platform technology-based dominance battles, or after the emergence of dominant designs.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2669","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the competitive dynamics of startups and diversifying entrants in technology without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although a theory of the drivers and consequences of stakeholder pressure has been developing, it focuses on pressures from organized stakeholders such as shareholders, NGOs, and activists, and does not incorporate the emerging possibility that individual voices may matter. By exploring corporate Twitter, which facilitates movement of individual stakeholders such as customers to a higher stakeholder class by providing them with a greater sense of power and urgency, we study the circumstances under which customer voices significantly affect analyst stock recommendations.

I argue that acquisitions motivated by operating synergies have the potential to experience greater gains than acquisitions driven by financial synergies but are harder to value and implement, making them more uncertain. Using SEC filings, conference calls and press releases to capture acquisition motives, I find that acquirers pursuing operating synergies are more likely to experience highly positive and highly negative long-term returns than acquirers pursuing financial synergies. I also find that acquisition experience and geographic proximity to targets soften acquirers' extreme downside outcomes in operating synergy acquisitions. My theory and results suggest that approaches that emphasize average outcomes for acquirers and use industry classifications to capture acquisition motives may be incomplete.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2686","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on acquisition motives and performance metrics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We propose a new conceptual model that characterizes the stochastic of observable shareholder activism as a compound product of two latent components representing (1) shareholder activists' propensity to target a company and (2) executives' propensity to settle activists' demands privately. Our model explicitly decouples corporate governance expectations for the two latent components embedded in activism process, and thus allows us to relax assumptions of homogenous shareholder interests and constrained managerial discretion where corporate managers are expected to negotiate privately and settle only value-creating activist demands. Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated Poisson regression reveals that corporate governance relationships with activism vary across shareholder demands and private settlements.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2472","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['shareholder activism', 'corporate governance', 'executives', 'demands']","The article discusses shareholder activism and corporate governance, which touches on themes of accountability and stakeholder interests.

Our empirical context is the UK M&A legal market, where micro-data enable us to observe the allocation of lawyers to M&A mandates under different incentive regimes. We find that law firms actively equalize the workload among their lawyers to seek efficiency gains, while \u201cstretching\u201d lawyers with high firm-specific capital to a greater extent. However, lawyers with high firm-specific capital also appear to influence the staffing process in their favor, leading to unbalanced allocations and less sharing of projects and clients.

We supplement this main result by identifying two moderating factors: the firm's level of political capital and the effectiveness of institutional constraints on government behavior.

I argue that founders face a \u201ccontrol dilemma\u201d in which a startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between the startup's value and the founder's ability to retain control of decision making. I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1\u201322.0 percent.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2478","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of founder control and its impact on startup valuation, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2017","38","2","Tyson B.

However, prior tests of this theory have examined the average diversification-performance relationship across all firms, instead of estimating the diversification-performance relationship at the individual firm level. Efforts to estimate this average relationship are inconsistent with a central assumption of much of strategic management theory\u2014that firms maximize value by choosing strategies that exploit their heterogeneous resources and individual situation.

Prior research has argued that the vertical integration of mortgage origination and securitization aligned divisional incentives and improved lending quality. We show that vertical integration improved loan performance only in those firms with strong corporate governance and that this performance-integration relationship strongly decreases and actually reverses as governance quality decreases. We interpret these findings as suggesting that the additional control afforded by vertical integration can, in the hands of poorly monitored managers, offset gains from aligned divisional incentives. These findings support the view that corporate governance influences the strategic outcomes of a firm, in our case, by influencing the effectiveness of boundary decisions.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2481","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['corporate governance', 'performance', 'incentives']","The article focuses primarily on corporate governance and performance in the context of the mortgage crisis, lacking significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Such a change creates two cohorts of firms, Entrants that lack experience in the industry and Incumbents that competed in the industry before the regulatory shift. The findings show that both cohorts' profit advantages persist, but at different rates: Superior performing Incumbents sustain an advantage longer than superior performing Entrants. This result is counterintuitive since Entrants are not constrained by a legacy of competing under the prior regime. Overall, the findings indicate that stages of a firm's development and of an industry's evolution are critical to understanding how long superior profits persist.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2483","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on profit persistence and competitive advantages without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Cash is more beneficial for firms operating in highly competitive, research-intensive, or growth-focused industries that are typical of contexts requiring adaptation in the face of uncertainties.

We extend arguments about managing conflicting objectives typically made at the firm level to the level of a firm's alliance portfolio. Specifically, will a balance between revenue enhancement and cost reduction attained collectively through partner resources accessed via a firm's various alliances be similarly beneficial for firm performance? Additionally, how do strategic attributes of alliance portfolio configuration, specifically alliance portfolio size and partner resource scope, condition the balance-performance relationship? Based on data from the global airline industry, we find support for the balance-performance relationship, though such balance is less beneficial for firms in the case of access to a broader resource scope per partner.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2488","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource management and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We explain how the effectiveness of external knowledge sourcing depends on the properties of internal knowledge production. We apply a social network lens to delineate interpersonal, intra-firm knowledge networks and capture the emergence of two important firm-level properties: the incumbent's internal potential for knowledge recombination and the level of knowledge coordination costs. We rely on firm-level internal knowledge networks to dynamically track the emergence of these properties across 106 global pharmaceutical companies over a 25-year time period. We find that a firm's success in developing knowledge in a new technological paradigm using external knowledge sourcing is contingent on these internal knowledge properties.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2489","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge generation', 'external sourcing', 'internal knowledge networks']","The article primarily focuses on knowledge generation and sourcing strategies within firms, lacking explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We conduct a laboratory experiment in which optimal exit is well defined, and in which a treatment group with equity stakes\u2014the actual cash flows of a firm and decision rights over its continuation\u2014is compared to a control group whose compensation is based solely on its assessment of the firm's profitability. While treatment group participants make exit decisions that are nearly optimal given their beliefs, their beliefs are significantly distorted relative to the control group. The pattern of distortion is consistent with confirmatory bias and motivated reasoning.

Our results suggest that in the face of negative events, engagement in CSR on a continuous, long-term basis provides insurance-like effects on both the stock and bond prices of firms. Nevertheless, the effects are found to quickly disappear following the occurrence of a second, or subsequent, negative event. Although our results clearly indicate that firms need to allocate some of their available resources to long-term strategic CSR activities, managers must also realize that in a crisis communication, they will probably be able to use their CSR claims on one occasion only.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2494","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['corporate social responsibility', 'negative events', 'strategic', 'long-term']","The article discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR), which is a key theme in the context of ethical business practices and social accountability.

Experience managing violent conflict risk and MNC subsidiary-level investment and expansion","Research summary: Researchers have increasingly emphasized the need to better understand how context affects the value of experiential learning. We address this gap by investigating when corporate-level experience can be leveraged across borders and when experience needs to be country-specific to be valuable. We test our hypotheses using a unique multi-source panel dataset of 379 large MNCs from 29 home countries and their subsidiaries in 117 host countries over a 10-year period, 1999\u20132008. In contrast to prior research, we find that the ability of a firm to leverage its experience with political risk across borders is limited by the type of risk involved. Experience with nonstate violent conflicts may be transferrable, but only country-specific experience appears to yield measureable benefits for conflicts involving the host country government.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2498","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['violent conflict', 'risk', 'investment']","The article discusses managing violent conflict risk, which touches on the implications of political and social contexts in business operations.

An attention model of top managers' opportunity beliefs for strategic action","Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top-down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom-up processes. In this article, we consider both top-down and bottom-up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2499","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the processes of attention allocation by top managers for identifying business opportunities, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If the performance of a new business falls below expectations, a diversified firm may be able to redeploy its resources back into related businesses. In effect, relatedness reduces the sunk costs associated with a new business, which facilitates exit. This, in turn, has implications for entry: By decreasing the cost of failure, the potential for redeployment justifies the undertaking of riskier entries and greater experimentation. These dynamic benefits of relatedness are distinct from standard notions of \u201csynergy.\u201d To show support for this idea, we provide a mathematical model, descriptive data, and company examples.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2501","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on economic concepts and resource management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Drawing on literature about organizational learning, negotiation, and information economics, we theorize that the party with greater experience will be able to obtain more value. Furthermore, we theorize that the effect of differential M&A experience on value obtained is contingent on the level of information asymmetry the acquirer faces with respect to the target, specifically as a function of the target's product-market scope and whether the deal is friendly. We test and find support for these predictions in a sample of 1,241 M&As over a 30-year period.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2502","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mergers and acquisitions, specifically on experience and information asymmetries, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that the actions or outcomes of single, salient organizations attract and motivate entrepreneurs, thus increasing the rate of foundings. We test this logic by examining the impact of the Yale University endowment's investment choices and of venture-capital-backed IPO run-ups on venture-capital foundings between 1984 and 2011.

Operationalizing negative shifts in the firm-specific policy environment through formal policy disputes between firms and governments, we find that following a dispute, firms are more likely to divest both in the country where the dispute occurs and in other countries in the same region. However, the impact of disputes on divestitures is firm specific, applying only to firms directly involved in a dispute.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2509","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['policy risk', 'divestitures', 'firm-specific']","The article discusses the impact of policy changes on firm strategy, but it primarily focuses on financial and strategic implications rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

Women in top-management teams and entrepreneurship in established firms","Research summary: We study the association between firms' entrepreneurial outcomes and their gender composition. Though highly topical, there is little solid empirical knowledge of this issue, which calls for an inductive approach. We match a paired-respondent questionnaire survey with population-wide employer-employee data, and find evidence that the presence of female top managers is positively related to entrepreneurial outcomes in established firms. Yet, this relation is conditional on the proportion between male and female top managers. Another finding is that the overall proportion of women in the firm's workforce negatively moderates the relation between female top managers and entrepreneurial outcomes. We discuss various mechanisms that can explain these findings, and argue that they are best understood in terms of the dynamics of social categorization.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2510","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","7","['women', 'gender composition', 'entrepreneurial outcomes', 'social categorization']","The article emphasizes the role of women in top-management teams and their impact on entrepreneurial outcomes, highlighting gender composition as a significant factor.

However, mechanisms that influence learning from competitive experience remain largely unexamined. We develop a computational model of dyadic rivalry to examine how time delays in competitors' feedback influence their learning. Time delays are inevitable because the process of executing competitive moves takes time, and the market's responses unfold gradually. We analyze how these lags impact learning and, subsequently, firms' competitive behavior, industry profits, and performance heterogeneity. In line with the extant learning literature, our findings reveal that time delays hinder learning from experience. However, this counterintuitively increases rivals' profits by reducing their investments in costly head-to-head competition. Time delays also engender performance heterogeneity by causing rivals' paths of competitive behavior to diverge.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2512","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Reaffirming that the CEO effect is mostly due to chance","How much of the variance in firm performance can be attributed to CEOs? This question has been the focus of a long debate in management research. In a recent study, I showed that a large portion of the performance differences that are often attributed to CEOs might in fact be due to chance. In a recent article, Quigley and Graffin argue that my conclusions can be avoided if more advanced methodological approaches are applied. Here I show that this is not the case, in fact if more realistic assumptions of how chance can affect firm performance are made, the effect of CEO leadership is almost indistinguishable from the effect of chance, independent of the estimation methodology.

We analyze the relations between R&D intensity (R&D spending to sales) and R&D spending on the one hand and 11 different indicators of firm risk on the other, using data from 1,907 to 3,908 firms in various industries over 13\u2009years. The analysis finds a general lack of consistent positive association between R&D and firm risk, making the use of R&D as an indicator of risk taking questionable. Furthermore, R&D intensity and spending do not correlate positively, suggesting they measure different constructs. We discuss potential reasons for these nonsignificant results. Our study demonstrates that researchers should avoid casual use of R&D as a proxy for risk taking without explicitly providing a clear definition and measurement model for risk.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2520","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of R&D spending and its relationship with firm risk, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This article argues that, in some settings, this is not the case because prior firm-specific human capital investments can be a market signal of an individual's willingness and ability to make such investments in the future. As such, the willingness and ability to make firm-specific investments is a type of general human capital that links firm-specific and general human capital in important ways. The article develops theory about these investments, market signals, and value appropriation. Then, the article examines implications for human resource management and several important questions in the field of strategic management, including theories of the firm and microfoundations of competitive advantage.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2521","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['human capital', 'investments', 'management']","The article discusses human capital investments and their implications for management, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, weak protection of minority shareholders, weak property rights, and ineffective law enforcement can allow those rents to be appropriated disproportionately by a firm's powerful insiders such as large owners and top managers. Recent data on Chinese publicly listed firms during 2007\u20132012 were used to demonstrate that the expected positive relationship between knowledge assets and performance is weaker in transition economies when a firm's ownership is highly concentrated and its managers have wide discretion. Moreover, rent appropriation by insiders was shown to vary with the levels of institutional development in which a firm operates.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2522","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['minority shareholders', 'property rights', 'institutional development']","The article discusses issues related to minority shareholders and property rights, which touch on themes of equity and fairness.

Although contingent compensation often aligned incentives between captains and shipowners, one difficult-to-contract hazard was threat of capture during wartime. We exploit variation across time and routes to study the relationship between capture threat and captain-ownership. Vessels were more likely to have captain-owners when undertaking wartime voyages on routes susceptible to privateers. Captain-owned vessels were less readily captured than those with nonowner captains, but more likely to forgo voyage profits to preserve the vessel's safety. These results are consistent with multitask agency, where residual claims to asset value rather than control rights influence captain behavior.

In this article, we draw on interpersonal attraction research to develop a positive approach to cross-cultural interaction with the cultural attractiveness (CA) construct, whereby members of a focal culture view another culture as desirable. We create a CA measure and establish its predictive validity with country reputation data. Using FDI data for 41 nations from 1985 to 2012 and performance data for 8,519 cross-border acquisitions (CBA) for 40 nations from 1990 to 2009, we find that CA is a predictor of FDI inflows and CBA outcomes, whose explanatory power is superior to cultural difference measures.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2528","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['cultural attractiveness', 'cross-cultural interaction', 'foreign direct investment']","The article discusses cultural interaction and attractiveness, which touches on themes of diversity and cross-cultural engagement.

We examine the determinants of foreign partners' representation on IJV boards in order to advance our knowledge of this facet of IJV governance. We argue that a foreign partner's representation on the IJV board is related to its equity contribution. However, we hypothesize that this relationship is moderated by IJV and host country characteristics that affect the importance of the internal and external roles IJV boards serve. These results provide insights into the conditions under which a partner might wish to secure greater board representation for its level of equity, or utilize less board representation than might be suggested by its equity level alone.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2529","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['representation', 'governance', 'equity']","The article discusses board representation and governance in international joint ventures, which touches on equity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

The analysis of 2,115 cross-border acquisitions in the global information technology industry shows that PDV differences undermine the long-term post-acquisition performance of acquirers.

Evidence from the uniform trade secret act","Research summary: We investigate the impact of trade secret legal protection on firm market value in the context of acquisitions. On one hand, market value may increase because trade secret assets become better protected from rivals. On the other hand, market value may decrease because trade secret protection reduces information about the target and its competitors available to potential buyers, increasing uncertainty about its value. Buyers will discount their offers in expectation of being compensated for riskier deals. Using a sample of private equity investments in the United States, we find that trade secret protection has a positive effect in industries with high mobility of knowledge workers, but a negative effect in industries with (1) high resource\u2013value uncertainty and (2) high poor-investment risk.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2533","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of trade secret legal protection and its impact on firm market value without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Based on the insights of performance feedback theory, we develop the theory of organizational reactions to external ratings to explain how firms' behaviors depend on their rating scores and their profitability. A central issue in our theory is the conflict between established internal goals and goals introduced by public ratings, with public ratings receiving lower priority than established profitability goals. Our theory suggests that, contrary to the expectations of the external stakeholders, firms targeted for criticism by ratings become less likely to adopt corresponding practices when their profitability is below aspirations. These arguments are supported in data on the diffusion of corporate governance practices in Canada.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2545","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['governance', 'ratings', 'stakeholders']","The article discusses the influence of public ratings on corporate governance practices, hinting at stakeholder interests.

In this study, I develop and test hypotheses regarding the impact of technical consultants on the quality of their clients' products. Using data from the Bordeaux wine industry, I find evidence that the use of technical consultants has a positive impact on relative product quality and a negative impact on the extremeness of relative product quality.

Specialization, however, depends critically on the stability of the task and contractual environment. In a highly uncertain environment, the need for frequent mutual adjustments favors integration instead of outsourcing. To evaluate vertical relationships in value chains where one stage competes on product variety under great uncertainty and the other stage competes on scale, we compare operations data at about 300 distribution centers within a major soft-drink bottler before and after it was integrated into an upstream concentrate producer.

Our examination of the antecedents and outcomes of complex competitive repertoires develops a more nuanced perspective. Data from 1,168 firms in 204 industries reveal that complexity initially harms performance, but then becomes a positive factor, except at high levels. We use agency and tournament theories, respectively, to examine how key governance mechanisms\u2014ownership structure and executive compensation\u2014help shape firms' competitive repertoires. We find that the principals of agency theory and the pay gap of tournament theory are both important antecedents of competitive complexity, and an interaction exists wherein firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2541","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['complexity', 'governance', 'performance']","The article discusses governance mechanisms and competitive complexity, but lacks a direct focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We use the exogenous shock of the 2008 financial crisis and a difference-in-differences analysis of 51,730 observations of business group affiliates in Taiwan to show that centralization of equity ties enhances affiliate performance, but such effects weaken when the environment becomes turbulent. Moreover, we find that listed affiliates obtain fewer benefits from centralization than unlisted affiliates.

This study compares the performance outcomes of two forms of reorganization, differing in their pervasiveness: organizational restructuring and organizational reconfiguration. Our dynamic panel data analysis of large U.S. corporations between 1985 and 2004 finds contrasting performance outcomes for these two forms of reorganization: in general, the more pervasive restructuring is associated with positive performance outcomes, while the more limited reconfiguration is associated with negative performance outcomes. However, outcomes vary by environment. Consistent with dynamic capabilities theory, we find evidence that in dynamic environments reconfiguration outcomes turn positive, while restructuring outcomes turn negative.

We argue that decreasing financial resources resulting from substantial performance shortfalls and the absence or availability of slack resources together affect the emphasis on different types of organizational change in response to performance shortfalls. Using data on the acquisition and divestment behavior of 530 companies in the information and communications technology sector from 1992 to 2014, we find that the frequency of resource-consuming acquisitions and of resource-freeing divestments are affected differently by performance below aspirations and that these relationships are moderated by the level of financial slack.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2544","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational change', 'resource constraints', 'performance shortfalls']","The article focuses primarily on organizational change in the context of performance and resource management, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Prior research has emphasized the role of external pressures, as well as CEO preferences, while little attention has been paid to the possibility that CSR may also stem from prevailing beliefs among the body politic of the firm. We introduce the concept of organizational political ideology to explain how political beliefs of organizational members shape corporate advances in CSR. Using a novel measure based on the political contributions by employees of Fortune 500 firms, we find that ideology predicts advances in CSR.

Competition from Microsoft's Encarta in 1993 led to sharp declines in the sales of books, which led to the distressed sale of the firm in 1996. This article offers new source material about the actions at both Encarta and Britannica, and it offers a novel interpretation of events. Britannica's management did not misperceive the opportunities and threats, and Britannica did not lack technical prowess. This narrative stresses that Britannica's management faced organizational diseconomies of scope between supporting lines of business in the old and new markets, which generated internal conflicts.

Following technological shocks, we argue that firms often seek alliances that provide new resources while also having incentives to form alliances for reinforced and challenged resources that complement the new resources. In parallel, alliance terminations, even involving resources otherwise unaffected by the discontinuity, increase due to limits in firms' alliance carrying capacity. We study biopharmaceutical firms between 1990 and 2000, which faced a technological discontinuity in 1995 in the form of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening.

Empirical results indicate that (1) stable effects of corporation-industry interaction are substantially important, but were unequally confounded with stable effects of business unit, corporation, and industry in results of previous studies; (2) stable effects of corporation, industry, and corporation-industry interaction, taken together, are of similar relative magnitude to stable effects of business unit; and (3) random and nonlinear year effects are very important in explaining dynamic variance.

Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud.

Specifically, we explore the moderating effects of creditor and employee rights on the performance effects of slack. Using longitudinal data from 162,633 European private firms in 26 countries, we find that financial slack enhances firm performance at diminishing rates, whereas human resource (HR) slack lowers performance at diminishing rates. However, financial slack has a more positive effect on firm performance in countries with weaker creditor rights, whereas HR slack has a more negative effect on performance in countries with stronger employee rights. The results provide a richer view of the relationship between slack and firm performance than currently assumed in the literature.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2583","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['employee rights', 'human resource', 'performance']","The article touches on employee rights and human resource management, indicating some awareness of social issues within the context of firm performance.

We develop a computational model of individual-level learning in an organizational setting characterized by interdependence and ambiguity. The model leads to organizational outcomes with the canonical properties of routines: constancy, efficacy, and organizational memory. At the same time, the process generating these outcomes also produces heterogeneity in firms' adaptive capacity to different types of technological change. An implication is that exploration policy in the formative period of routine development can influence a firm's capacity to adapt to change in maturity. This points to a host of strategic trade-offs, not only between performance and adaptive capacity, but also between adaptive capacities to different forms of change.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2584","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of organizational adaptation to technological change without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The influence of board chairs on firm performance","Research summary: We use a variance decomposition methodology to assess the degree to which board chairs may influence their companies' performance. To isolate the board chair effect, we focus on firms in which the CEO and board chair positions are separated. Using a U.S. sample of 6,290 firm-year observations representing 1,828 board chairs in 308 different industries, our results indicate that the board chair effect is substantial at about nine percent. Drawing on resource dependency theory, we also theorize and show how this board chair effect is contingent on the task environment in which firms operate. Our results add to the literature examining the role and influence of board chairs and the context in which chairs may have a greater impact on performance.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2587","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of board chair influence on firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

How mobility networks across countries and status groups affect the creative performance of organizations","Research summary: Losing key employees to competitors allows an organization to engage in external boundary-spanning activities. It may benefit the organization through access to external knowledge, but may also increase the risks of leaking knowledge to competitors. We propose that the destination of departed employees is a crucial contingency: benefits or risks only materialize when employees leave for competitors that differ from the focal organization along significant dimensions, such as country or status group. In the context of the global fashion industry, we find that key employees' moves to foreign competitors may increase (albeit at a diminishing rate) their former employers' creative performance. Furthermore, firms may suffer from losing key employees to higher- or same-status competitors, but may benefit from losing them to lower-status competitors.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2602","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['mobility networks', 'status groups', 'creative performance']","The article discusses the impact of employee mobility across different countries and status groups, which touches on themes of diversity and equity in organizational performance.

Yet, clearly, factors beyond profitability influence firms' environmental choices. We treat these choices as organizational change decisions and hypothesize that adoption of environmental initiatives is influenced by a combination of profit, level of disruption caused, and external influences. We test our hypotheses by examining firms' choices regarding implementation of energy-savings initiatives. We find that degree of disruption, number of prior local adopters, and strength of environmental norms affect the adoption decisions. In addition, the effect of disruption is amplified by the implementation costs, but is mitigated by the number of prior local adopters.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2603","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['environmental', 'initiatives', 'norms', 'disruption']","The article discusses the adoption of environmental initiatives, emphasizing factors beyond profitability, which aligns with themes of sustainability and ethical organizational practices.

Yet, both the specification of social reference points and the dynamics of attention allocation have received little scholarly examination. We address performance feedback from two social reference points relative to divisions in multidivisional firms: economic reference point and political reference point. Comparing divisional performance with the two reference points can give consistent or inconsistent feedback, which has important consequences for the dynamics of attention allocation in adaptive aspirations. We find consistent feedback leads to more attention to own experience, while inconsistent feedback results in more attention to the social reference point the focal division underperforms.

The fundamental feature of firms in hypercompetitive settings is that they are constantly challenged to improve their competitiveness in a relentless race to outperform one another. Analyzing a unique data set from the Formula 1 motorsport racing industry, we find an inverse U-shaped relationship between team diversity in task-related experience and performance an important result that diverges from well-established theories developed in more stable environments. Fundamentally, we show that the role of R&D team experience diversity varies depending on the size of the organizations in which R&D teams operate. While we find a moderating effect for firm age, this effect is not as robust as that of firm size.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2577","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['diversity', 'performance', 'R&D team']","The article discusses 'team diversity' and its impact on performance, indicating a moderate focus on diversity themes within a business context.

Within the agency framework, shareholders typically oppose governance provisions that limit their power because those provisions could undermine shareholder influence and increase agency costs. However, when shareholders support provisions that constrain their power, managers could respond positively by refraining from self-interested behavior in the form of managerial misconduct. We find this to be especially true in industries where these governance provisions are particularly relevant to managers and in scenarios where CEOs do not also serve as board chair.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2582","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['governance', 'misconduct', 'shareholder power']","The article primarily focuses on governance and managerial misconduct within a traditional agency framework, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

We argue that MNE responses to external threats depend on the firm's vulnerability, which we decompose into exposure (proximity to threat), at-risk resources (potential for loss), and resilience (capacity for coping). We test the independent and interactive effects of these dimensions using a geo-referenced sample of 1,162 MNE subsidiaries in 20 war-afflicted countries between 1987 and 2006. We find that highly valuable resources can become liabilities when exposed to harm, and the best way to cope with external threats may be to exit. Our findings extend the resource-based view and real options theory by demonstrating the bounded value of resources and options in the face of environmental contingencies.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2599","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['vulnerability', 'war-afflicted', 'exit', 'multinationals']","The article discusses the challenges faced by multinationals in war-afflicted countries, touching on themes of vulnerability and resilience.

We analyze data from a survey of firms in high-technology industries to determine whether it is possible to break the commonly experienced trade-off between strategic planning's positive influence on firm profitability and its negative influence on firm innovation. We draw on Adler and Borys's (1996) conceptualization of bureaucratic process types to identify several firm characteristics that have the potential to affect whether employees perceive strategic planning as enabling to their creative endeavors.

Firms cooperate to create value, but they can also compete to capture value. Fundamental questions rarely addressed by strategy scholars relate to how the configuration of control over resources influences firms' strategies, the potential for termination, and the emergence of cooperation and trust. The formal results reveal crucial aspects of the interorganizational rent-generating process and yield testable implications. With greater synergistic benefits, firms invest more, but they also compete more intensively to capture more value. With symmetric control, more value gets created, which limits the potential for termination, but also exacerbates the competition for value; from a relational perspective, this form of control augments the calculative rationale of cooperation and trust.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2610","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic interactions and value creation in business alliances without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We propose that product variety magnifies the tension between scale economies in production and scope economies in distribution, giving rise to complex sourcing relationships. Sourcing complexity worsens performance and poses a dilemma for organization design: A hierarchical structure with intermediate coordinating units such as sourcing hubs reduces sourcing complexity for downstream distribution but creates bottlenecks at the hubs, hurting performance for both the hubs and downstream distribution. We empirically examine operations data for about 300 distribution centers within a major soft drink bottling company in 2010\u20132011.

We distinguish between inventors who leave their incumbent employers to found spin-outs and those who become non-founding employees of existing new ventures. Using a sample of new ventures and incumbent firms in the U.S. information technology (IT) sector, we find that incumbents are more likely to benefit from patented knowledge that spills in from their spin-outs than from new ventures that employ non-founding inventors formerly employed by the respective incumbent. Any advantage that parent firms have in reaping such knowledge quickly dissipates, however, when these parents have a history of misappropriating the intellectual property of others.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2625","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge spill-in', 'incumbent firms', 'intellectual property']","The article discusses knowledge transfer and the implications of intellectual property, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Building on literature in social psychology and behavioral economics that links heterogeneity in individual social motives to social interactions, we explain how the variation, selection, and retention processes underlying a group's deliberate capability development are affected by the composition of the group in terms of individuals' social motives in interplay with the organizational-level motivational levers designed by managers. Our multilevel theoretical model suggests that individual-level heterogeneity leads to the development of capabilities along different paths. For practice, this implies that, according to the composition of the group in terms of social motives, capabilities are more or less technically and evolutionary adequate and a source of business process performance.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2605","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['social motives', 'capability development', 'individual-level heterogeneity']","The article discusses the role of individual social motives and their impact on capability development within organizations, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics and diversity in motivations.

We propose that theorization by local regulatory agencies is a key mechanism that links legitimacy concerns with acquisition outcomes. Given that theorization is time consuming and its outcome is uncertain, we argue that state-owned foreign firms experience a lower likelihood of acquisition completion and a longer duration for completing a deal than other foreign firms. Moreover, we introduce a set of firm characteristics (target public status, target R&D alliances, and acquirer acquisition and alliance experiences) that may affect the threshold level of legitimacy, thereby altering the proposed relationships. Our framework and findings provide useful implications for institutional theory on its core concept of legitimacy.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2609","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['legitimacy', 'stakeholders', 'institutional theory']","The article discusses legitimacy concerns related to cross-border acquisitions, which touches on stakeholder perspectives but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We examined why firms assumed to be in general alignment with this theory might nonetheless produce solutions of varying usefulness. We theorize that a firm's internal knowledge variety (IKV) is associated with its capacity to support cross-domain knowledge flows during search, and its ability to identify and explore promising areas on the solution landscape. We further theorize that partner knowledge in familiar (unfamiliar) domains can offset specific weaknesses in searching rugged landscapes, inherent with low or high (moderate) IKV.

Evidence from a regression discontinuity","Research summary: In this paper, we theorize and empirically investigate how a long-term orientation impacts firm value. To study this relationship, we exploit exogenous changes in executives' long-term incentives. Specifically, we examine shareholder proposals on long-term executive compensation that pass or fail by a small margin of votes.

How losing employees to competitors can enhance firm status","Research summary: Because employees can provide a firm with human capital advantages over competitors, firms invest considerably in employee recruiting and retention. Departing from the retention imperative of strategic human capital management, we propose that certain employee departures can enhance a firm's competitiveness in the labor market. Specifically, increased rates of career-advancing departures by a firm's employees can signal to potential future employees that the firm offers a prestigious employment experience that enhances external mobility opportunities. Characterizing advancement based on subsequent employers and positions, we analyze data on U.S. law firm hiring and industry surveys of perceived firm status between 2004 and 2013. We find that increased rates of employee departures lead to increases in a firm's prestige when these departures are for promotions with high-status competitors.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2630","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['employee departures', 'firm status', 'prestige']","The article primarily focuses on the strategic implications of employee turnover and firm prestige, lacking a clear emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper provides empirical evidence that industry-level characteristics relate to debt pricing through risk premiums. We address the empirical challenges that arise when testing these theories by using a proprietary dataset of time-varying and forward-looking measures of industry characteristics. These characteristics include growth, sensitivity to external shocks, and industry structure, all measured at the six-digit NAICS level. Our results show that lenders demand higher spreads to bear industry-level risk. The relation exists within subsamples with constant credit ratings, and strengthens when lenders' loan portfolios are less diversified and during periods when diversification is difficult. Therefore, our results suggest that industry characteristics relate to debt pricing by informing lenders not only about expected loss, but also about risk premiums.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/1/1/3902/Industry-Characteristics-Risk-Premiums-and-Debt","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt pricing and industry characteristics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We discuss several PSM design choices and review the use of PSM in 86 articles in leading accounting journals from 2008\u20132014. We document a significant increase in the use of PSM from zero studies in 2008 to 26 studies in 2014. However, studies often oversell the capabilities of PSM, fail to disclose important design choices, and/or implement PSM in a theoretically inconsistent manner. We then empirically illustrate complications associated with PSM in three accounting research settings. We first demonstrate that when the treatment is not binary, PSM tends to confine analyses to a subsample of observations where the effect size is likely to be smallest. We also show that seemingly innocuous design choices greatly influence sample composition and estimates of the ATE.

Existing research shows that states with strict balanced budget rules address deficits by raising taxes and curbing expenditures. However, little is known about whether politicians can meet budget rules by shifting resources inter-temporally or by transferring revenues from funds not subject to balanced budget rules into funds that are required to meet a balanced budget. We show that, in addition to increasing taxes and cutting expenditures, states with strict balanced budget rules sell public assets and transfer resources across government funds to close the budget shortfall. Our findings suggest that current budget deficits not only influence the current-period taxpayers, but also impact future taxpayers and other funds within the government. The results complement existing research by expanding our understanding of the effects of balanced budget restrictions on politicians' fiscal actions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/1/51/3862/The-Impact-of-Balanced-Budget-Restrictions-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fiscal actions and balanced budget rules without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

The presence of multiple numerical signals provides the manager with an opportunity to hide information via aggregation, presenting net amounts in order to show information in its best light. We show that this ability to aggregate fundamentally changes the nature of voluntary disclosure, due to the market's inability to verify that a report is free of strategic aggregation. We find that, in equilibrium, the manager fully discloses if and only if the manager's private information makes the firm look sufficiently weak. By separating bad news from good news, a disaggregate report informs the market of as much offsetting news as possible, revealing how close the news is to a neutral benchmark. The result is, therefore, pooling at the top and separation at the bottom, the opposite of what transpires with a single news source.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/1/73/3926/Discretionary-Aggregation","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial disclosure and aggregation without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Theory and Evidence on the Quality of Workers in Online Labor Markets","Online labor markets allow rapid recruitment of large numbers of workers for very low pay. Although online workers are often used as research participants, there is little evidence that they are motivated to make costly choices to forgo wealth or leisure that are often central to addressing accounting research questions. Thus, we investigate the validity of using online workers as a proxy for non-experts when accounting research designs use more demanding tasks than these workers typically complete. Three experiments examine the costly choices of online workers relative to student research participants. We find that online workers are at least as willing as students to make costly choices, even at significantly lower wages. We also find that online workers are sensitive to performance-based wages, which are just as effective in inducing high effort as high fixed wages. We discuss implications of our results for conducting accounting research with online workers.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/1/93/3867/Scoundrels-or-Stars-Theory-and-Evidence-on-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['online labor markets', 'workers', 'wages']","The article discusses the conditions of online labor markets and the treatment of workers, touching on issues of pay and effort.

We find that this auditor effect is more pronounced for clients who have a higher demand for information as measured by client size, industry competition, and client complexity.

We find that the conflicts between central and local governments arising from the 2002 tax sharing reform have led to more tax avoidance by local government-controlled firms, particularly when the local government's ownership percentage of the firms is higher than the tax sharing ratio. We also find evidence that the overall level of tax avoidance by local government-controlled firms in a region is positively associated with local fiscal deficits. As a high level of government ownership of corporations and intergovernmental tax sharing are common phenomena in many transitional economies, this study offers valuable insights into how the dual roles played by local governments affect tax policy enforcement in these economies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/2/247/3882/Tax-Collector-or-Tax-Avoider-An-Investigation-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['tax avoidance', 'local governments', 'fiscal deficits']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of tax collection and avoidance within local governments, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We predict that earnings exhibits asymmetric timeliness with respect to multiple indicators, including stock return, sales change, and operating cash flow change, which differentially explain write-downs of current assets, long-lived tangible assets, and indefinite-lived goodwill. We predict an interaction effect between indicators, such that the total impact of several consistent indicators is greater than the sum of their individual impacts. Empirical estimates for U.S. firms are consistent with our predictions and yield new insights about the effects of multiple indicators for both conservatism and impairment research.

Failure to control for the effects of firm growth and performance on innate accruals leads to excessive Type I error rates in tests of earnings management. We propose simple refinements to Jones-type models that deal with non-linear growth and performance effects and show that the expanded models are well-specified and exhibit high power in quarterly settings where one is testing for earnings management.

In contrast to prior research that analysts ignore or are confused by taxes, we provide evidence that analysts pay attention to taxes and improve on management estimates. Based on our evidence that management's quarterly ETRs have less predictive value in the presence of discrete items, we suggest standard-setters reexamine the discrete item exception to require more disclosure.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/3/1/3887/Forecasting-Taxes-New-Evidence-from-Analysts","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of tax forecasting and management estimates without addressing any social justice, ethical, or DEI themes.

Results suggest that multinational firms alter the distribution of reported profits to take advantage of losses. Our point estimate for profitable affiliates implies that an increase of one standard deviation in the tax incentive, C, of an affiliate with an average return on assets of 13.3 is associated with a lower return on assets of 0.5 percentage points.

Discerning Opportunity and Incentive to Report Smooth Earnings","A fundamental accounting question is whether investors perceive low risk when earnings are smooth relative to the volatility of operating cash flows. We conduct two experiments to examine this question. Absent additional information concerning the likelihood of earnings management, our first experiment finds that investors give managers the benefit of the doubt and perceive low risk when earnings are relatively smooth. Given this finding, our second experiment examines whether additional information that supports investors' suspicions of earnings management affects investors' risk judgments when earnings are relatively smooth. We find that investors no longer give managers the benefit of the doubt when additional information suggests that managers have either the opportunity or the incentive to report smooth earnings.

Using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences research designs, we document that loan spreads increase by 22 percent on bank loans initiated within a year after auditor changes, increasing direct loan costs by approximately $6.6 million. We also find a significant increase in upfront and annual fees and the probability of pledging collateral, consistent with an increase in screening and monitoring by banks. The increase in spreads is significant for client-initiated auditor changes, with or without disagreements with the auditor, as well as for auditor resignations. Further, the significant increase in loan spreads is documented for upward, lateral, and downward auditor changes. Our results are robust to other proxies for financial reporting quality. Finally, we find no effect resulting from the forced auditor changes due to Arthur Andersen.

We document larger (smaller) earnings response coefficients for announcements accompanied by reinforcing (contradicting) analyst forecast revisions. Analyses of management forecasts suggest that analyst revisions and management forecasts convey complementary information.

Furthermore, I show that organized labor influences the structure of syndicated loans. When firms with strong unions withhold public disclosures, but communicate privately with lead lenders, heightened information asymmetry between the lead lenders and the participant lenders induces the lead lenders to retain larger shares of the loans and form more concentrated syndicates. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proprietary costs of disclosure related to organized labor significantly influence firms' debt contracting decisions and outcomes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/3/57/3856/Organized-Labor-and-Debt-Contracting-Firm-Level","articles","TAR","Accounting","5","['organized labor', 'stakeholder', 'collective bargaining']","The article discusses the role of organized labor as a significant stakeholder in debt contracting, which indicates a moderate focus on social equity themes.

We measure analysts' political connections based on political contributions at the brokerage-house level. We argue that if brokerages are able to obtain private information through their political connections, then analysts at politically connected brokerages should issue more profitable stock recommendations, and this increased profitability should be more pronounced for politically sensitive stocks. Our evidence is consistent with these predictions. Analyses of recommendations issued surrounding the Affordable Care Act further support our main inferences. Moreover, our findings hold after we employ numerous tests to address correlated omitted variables and endogeneity.

We extend this literature by considering how disclosure readability affects the sensitivity of investors' valuation judgments to the information contained in outside (i.e., non-firm) sources of information. Using an experiment, we present investors with a disclosure containing mixed news about the valence of firm performance, and this disclosure varies in readability. We find that investors who initially view a less readable firm disclosure provide valuation judgments that incorporate the outside information to a greater extent, such that their valuation judgments are more sensitive to whether outside information is relatively more or less supportive of management's positive forward-looking statements. We find evidence that this occurs primarily because investors who view a less readable initial disclosure feel less comfortable evaluating the firm and, in turn, rely more on the outside information. We also find that viewing a less readable firm disclosure indirectly increases the extent to which participants search outside information. Combined, our results suggest that investors' valuation judgments may be more influenced by outside sources of information when managers provide less readable firm disclosures, potentially limiting the extent to which managers can benefit from strategically issuing less readable disclosures to obfuscate poor performance. These findings also imply that investors might over-rely on more readable disclosures while discounting outside sources of information about the firm.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/1/3916/Disclosure-Readability-and-the-Sensitivity-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['readability', 'valuation', 'disclosure']","The article discusses the impact of disclosure readability on investor behavior, which touches on ethical considerations in financial reporting.

Consistent with the theory, we find that auditors react to the immediately felt costs of information collection (e.g., time and effort) at the expense of a more global consideration of information value (i.e., auditors collect lower-quality audit evidence). However, foraging behavior is moderated by removing the personal cost to the individual auditor (identifying audit evidence for another member of the audit team to collect), further demonstrating that these personally felt costs influence auditor choices in a way that reduces the quality of information collected. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating how information foraging can influence evidence quality and, thus, audit quality, and how a slight alteration of audit methodology can mitigate this behavior.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/145/3911/Auditor-Information-Foraging-Behavior","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit methodology and information foraging without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We predict that the AT coefficient will be positive even in the absence of conditional conservatism, and it will vary with non-accounting factors even if the degree of conditional conservatism is held constant. Our empirical analysis shows that AT coefficient estimates vary in directions predicted by our theory. Specifically, we find that AT coefficient estimates increase with expected returns and asymmetry in the distribution of returns, and decrease with cash flow persistence. Importantly, we identify the spread between the variances of bad news and good news accruals as an alternative measure of conditional conservatism that is free of the effects confounding the AT coefficient. Consistent with a key implication of conditional conservatism, we find that the variance of bad news accruals is significantly higher than the variance of good news accruals primarily due to conditionally conservative accruals related to inventory write-downs, long-term asset write-downs, and goodwill impairments. A series of placebo tests provides additional support for the construct validity of our alternative measure of conditional conservatism.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/191/3881/Identifying-Conditional-Conservatism-in-Financial","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial accounting and reporting without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Management succession introduces uncertainty about firms' future operations, financial policies, and potential motivation for earnings management, which we predict elevates the perceived risk of financial reporting improprieties. Consistent with this prediction, we find that audit fees are higher for firms with new CEOs. Importantly, however, we note that careful CEO succession planning (i.e., promoting an \u201cheir apparent\u201d) attenuates perceptions of higher risk, as evidenced by a lack of an audit pricing adjustment. These results are robust to several alternative specifications and analyses designed to mitigate the concern that the association between audit fees and CEO succession and succession planning is driven by factors leading to the CEO change. We also show that audit fee increases dissipate over time as the new, non-heir CEO stays longer at the firm, reinforcing the inference that audit fees increase in response to the uncertainty surrounding a new CEO. Additionally, we do not find evidence of a deterioration in audit quality with new CEOs, independent of the succession plan.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/27/3944/Do-CEO-Succession-and-Succession-Planning-Affect","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['stakeholders', 'perceptions', 'risk']","The article primarily focuses on financial reporting risk and audit fees related to CEO succession, with minimal emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We find that as information uncertainty about borrowers increases, Egan Jones's rating accuracy, informativeness, and timeliness decrease relative to Standard & Poor's. Our findings suggest that Egan Jones's more restricted rating methodology can lead to limitations in information processing and, thus, reductions in Egan Jones's rating quality advantage for borrowers with greater information uncertainty.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/53/3893/When-Do-Differences-in-Credit-Rating-Methodologies","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['credit rating', 'methodologies', 'information uncertainty']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of credit rating methodologies and their impact on rating quality, without addressing social justice or ethical implications.

Building on prior interview-based and experimental research, we provide an engagement-level analysis of challenging FVMs, using quantitative and qualitative data on audit phases from risk assessment to booking adjustments. Challenging FVMs have high estimation uncertainty, high subjectivity, significant/complex assumptions, and multiple valuation techniques. Estimation uncertainty is associated with higher inherent risk assessments, which are, in turn, predictive of client problems identified during the engagement. The use of a valuation specialist by auditors, associated with higher inherent risk and client specialist use, is a key decision: procedures performed by specialists have the highest yield in identifying problems. Auditor-client discussion of an adjustment increases with problem identification and auditors' expressions of residual concern about uncertainty post-testing. However, booked audit adjustments are infrequent; the only factors explaining income-decreasing adjustments are better evidential support and breadth of problems identified.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/4/81/3959/Auditing-Challenging-Fair-Value-Measurements","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['auditing', 'fair value', 'uncertainty']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing fair value measurements without any significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The theory of motivated reasoning is employed to analyze the effects of these two factors that should lead individual auditors to adopt as a directional goal the acceptance of client management's aggressive accounting. Accordingly, we predict and find that auditors experiencing greater client affinity and facing explicit client pressure suggest lower adjustments to clients' aggressive accounting, consistent with motivated reasoning's goal-related predictions. But our study goes further and investigates also how auditors react when motivated reasoning theory's \u201creasonableness constraint\u201d is potentially violated by auditors who perceive excessive client pressure. We predict and find, consistent with the individual auditor's \u201creasonable constraint\u201d being triggered in at least some auditors, that perception of client pressure intensity leads those auditors to propose larger adjustments to client accounting. To support our findings, we re-analyze the data from a prior motivated reasoning audit experiment, replicate that study's reported directional goal results employing methods used in this study and, in addition, find similar results to those found in this study for increased client pressure intensity on auditor judgment.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/5/117/3931/The-Effects-of-Auditor-Affinity-for-Client-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['auditor', 'client pressure', 'motivated reasoning']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of auditor judgment and client relationships, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

The paper identifies conditions under which a regime that allows managers to grant access to information selectively maximizes aggregate information. Strikingly, this happens when the objectives of managers and users are sufficiently misaligned. This finding is robust to variations of the model, such as information acquisition cost, unobservable precision, sequential noisy actions taken by the users, and delayed choice of the subset of users in \u201cthe know.\u201d These results call into doubt the common belief that forcing managers to provide unrestricted access to information to all potential users is always beneficial.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/5/167/3890/Divide-and-Inform-Rationing-Information-to","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['information', 'manager', 'users', 'objectives']","The article focuses on a technical model of information dissemination without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

The reduction in reserves is concentrated among multinational firms and firms with larger reserves prior to Schedule UTP. These findings suggest that some firms changed their financial reporting for uncertain tax positions to avoid Schedule UTP reporting requirements without changing the underlying positions. In contrast with prior studies, this evidence represents a permanent, rather than a temporary, tax-induced reporting change.

In their public forecasts, they benefit from introducing an upward bias. We explore how the effectiveness of the private and public channels in communicating information to analysts affects managers' incentive to engage in expectations management, and provide a number of empirical predictions.

This finding is in line with the notion of higher managerial short-termism resulting from increased reporting frequency requirements. Further, we provide evidence that reporting frequency-induced real activities manipulations are more pronounced if the price pressure from investors is high and if the informativeness of IMS disclosure is low.

Although these social ties can facilitate information transfer and help auditors alleviate management pressure to waive correction of detected misstatements, close interpersonal relations can undermine auditors' monitoring of the financial reporting process. We measure social ties by alma mater connections, professor-student bonding, and employment affiliation, and audit quality by the propensity to render modified audit opinions, financial reporting irregularities, and firm valuation. Our evidence implies that social ties between engagement auditors and audit committee members impair audit quality. In additional results consistent with expectations, we generally find that this relation is concentrated where social ties are more salient, or firm governance is relatively poor and agency conflicts are more severe. Implying reciprocity stemming from social networks, we also report some suggestive evidence that audit fees are higher in the presence of social ties between an engagement auditor and the audit committee. Collectively, our analysis lends support to the narrative that the negative implications\u2014namely, worse audit quality and higher audit fees\u2014of these social ties may outweigh the benefits.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/5/61/3976/Do-Social-Ties-between-External-Auditors-and-Audit","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['audit quality', 'social ties', 'agency conflicts']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of audit quality and the implications of social ties in a financial context, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques that would align with 'woke' themes.

We examine how the degree of quantification in client evidence and client control environment risk influence auditors' planned substantive testing of management's discretionary inputs to FVMs. We find that auditors allocate a lower proportion of effort to testing the subjective inputs to the fair value estimate when the degree of quantification in the client evidence and level of client risk are both high. Further, this tendency persists even after auditors receive a regulatory practice alert reminding them to focus more audit effort on testing fair value (FV) inputs that are susceptible to management bias, and despite the auditors increasing their overall audit effort. Qualitative analyses of the procedures auditors selected indicate that inapt attention to the degree of quantification in evidence is a potential root cause of the difficulty auditors encounter when testing complex estimates. Our results imply that in situations where both quantified and non-quantified data are important to the audit, there is the potential for management to manipulate the evidence they provide to auditors to distract auditors from testing the discretionary inputs to complex estimates that are susceptible to management opportunism.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/5/89/3947/Use-of-High-Quantification-Evidence-in-Fair-Value","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['management bias', 'auditors', 'discretionary inputs']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing and management bias without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Specific investments increase efficiency at the margin. This expands the scale of operations and thereby adds to the compensation risk borne by the managers. Accounting for this investment/risk link overturns key findings from prior incomplete contracting studies. We find that if the investing manager has full bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the other manager, he will underinvest relative to the benchmark of contractible investments; with equal bargaining power, however, he may overinvest. The reason is that the investing manager internalizes only his own share of the investment-induced risk premium (we label this a \u201crisk transfer\u201d), whereas the principal internalizes both managers' incremental risk premia. We show that high pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) reduces the managers' incentives to invest in relationship-specific assets.

Last, we provide some evidence that managers are more knowledgeable about other firms in the same geographic area. Specifically, managers are more likely to reference firms in their industry that are geographically closer during conference calls.

The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuer, the Emerging Growth Company (EGC), and exempts EGCs from several disclosures required for non-EGCs. Our findings are consistent with proprietary cost concerns motivating EGCs to eliminate some of the previously mandatory disclosures, which increases information uncertainty in the IPO market, attracts investors who rely more on private information, and leads EGCs to provide additional post-IPO disclosures to mitigate the increased information uncertainty. Our results also are consistent with agency explanations, whereby EGCs exploit the JOBS Act provisions to avoid compensation-related disclosures, which results in larger IPO underpricing for such firms. Overall, we provide evidence on how reduced mandatory disclosure affects the IPO market.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/6/25/3886/The-JOBS-Act-and-Information-Uncertainty-in-IPO","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of the JOBS Act and its impact on information uncertainty in IPO firms, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

We show that our measure of tax-sensitive investors dominates other measures in the portfolio rebalancing and price pressure tests. In the fund performance test, our measure of tax-sensitivity is the only one that finds that tax-sensitive investors have significantly lower returns on their portfolio stocks, which is a new result in the literature.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/6/49/3923/Measuring-Tax-Sensitive-Institutional-Investor","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of institutional investor behavior and tax sensitivity without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Accounting conservatism accelerates the recognition of the bad news and its dissemination to gatekeepers, making it more likely that the CEO will acknowledge the problem earlier and start searching for solutions. Therefore, firms where both characteristics\u2014CEO overconfidence and accounting conservatism\u2014are present should perform better. Our empirical tests confirm this prediction: firms that practice conservative accounting and are run by overconfident CEOs exhibit better cash flow performance. Our results continue to hold in a variety of settings, including market reactions to acquisitions, cash flow downside risk, and analyst following. Further, the joint positive effect of CEO overconfidence and accounting conservatism on firm performance is stronger in high-uncertainty environments and in firms facing less stringent financing constraints, consistent with theoretical predictions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/92/6/77/3964/Does-Accounting-Conservatism-Mitigate-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and CEO behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.
