Drawing on upper echelons theory and behavioral decision theory, we developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 2,790 CEOs of diverse manufacturing firms in China. The positive relationship between CEO hubris and firm risk taking was found to be stronger when CEO managerial discretion was stronger: when a firm faced munificent but complex markets; had less inertia and more intangible resources; had a CEO who also chaired its board; and had a CEO who was not politically appointed.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.48036912","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['CEO hubris', 'risk taking', 'managerial discretion']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between CEO behavior and firm risk, lacking a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We consider who among top managers and directors of large firms is most likely to exercise such tactics and how their use affects the likelihood of garnering board appointments at other firms. An analysis of survey data on interpersonal influence behavior from a large sample of managers and chief executive officers (CEOs) at Forbes 500 companies strongly supports our theoretical arguments: managers' and directors' ingratiatory behavior toward colleagues is more likely to yield board appointments at other firms to the extent that it comprises relatively subtle forms of flattery and opinion conformity, which our theory suggests are less likely to elicit cynical attributions of motive. Supplementary analyses also indicate that these relationships are mediated by an increased likelihood of receiving a colleague's recommendation for the appointment. Moreover, we theorize and find that managers and directors who have a background in politics, law, or sales, or an upper-class background, are more sophisticated and successful in their ingratiatory behavior.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.2.278","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['influence', 'appointments', 'managers', 'directors']","The article focuses on interpersonal influence tactics and board appointments without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We argue that the legal environment, particularly as it is constructed by the enforcement activities of regulators, significantly influences the likelihood that organizations will effectively implement the self-regulatory commitments they symbolically adopt. We investigate how different enforcement tools can foster or undermine organizations' normative motivations to self-regulate. We find that organizations are more likely to follow through on their commitments to self-regulate when they (and their competitors) are subject to heavy regulatory surveillance and when they adopt self-regulation in the absence of an explicit threat of sanctions. We also find that historically poor compliers are significantly less likely to follow through on their commitments to self-regulate, suggesting a substantial limitation on the use of self-regulation as a strategy for reforming struggling organizations. Taken together, these findings suggest that self-regulation can be a useful tool for leveraging the normative motivations of regulated organizations but that it cannot replace traditional deterrence-based enforcement.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.3.361","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['self-regulation', 'normative motivations', 'legal environment', 'compliance', 'symbolic commitments']","The article discusses the normative motivations behind self-regulation and compliance, indicating a moderate focus on ethical organizational practices.

We manipulated both the gender of the employees being evaluated and whether the company's core values emphasized meritocracy in evaluations and compensation. The main finding is consistent across the three studies: when an organization is explicitly presented as meritocratic, individuals in managerial positions favor a male employee over an equally qualified female employee by awarding him a larger monetary reward. This finding demonstrates that the pursuit of meritocracy at the workplace may be more difficult than it first appears and that there may be unrecognized risks behind certain organizational efforts used to reward merit. We discuss possible underlying mechanisms leading to the paradox of meritocracy effect as well as the scope conditions under which we expect the effect to occur.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.543","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['meritocracy', 'bias', 'gender', 'organizational culture']","The article addresses the paradox of meritocracy and its implications for gender bias in organizational settings, highlighting the risks associated with meritocratic ideals.

An important attribute of a market session chosen by the procurer is its information revelation policy. The revelation policy determines the information (such as the number of competitors, the winning bids, etc.) that will be revealed to participating suppliers at the conclusion of each market session. Suppliers participating in multiple market sessions use strategic bidding and fake their own cost structure to obtain information revealed at the end of each market session. The information helps to reduce two types of uncertainties encountered in future market sessions, namely, their opponents' cost structure and an estimate of the number of their competitors. Whereas the first type of uncertainty is present in physical and e-marketplaces, the second type of uncertainty naturally arises in IT-enabled marketplaces. Through their effect on the uncertainty faced by suppliers, information revelation policies influence the bidding behavior of suppliers which, in turn, determines the expected price paid by the procurer. Therefore, the choice of information revelation policy has important consequences for the procurer. This paper develops a partially observable Markov decision process model of supplier bidding behavior and uses a multiagent e-marketplace simulation to analyze the effect that two commonly used information revelation policies\u2014complete information policy and incomplete information policy\u2014have on the expected price paid by the procurer. We find that the expected price under the complete information policy is lower than that under the incomplete information policy. The integration of ideas from the multiagents literature, the machine-learning literature, and the economics literature to develop a method to evaluate information revelation policies in e-marketplaces is a novel feature of this paper.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0168","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information revelation policies in procurement auctions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Anchoring and Adjustment in Adapting Existing Database Queries","Reusing database queries by adapting them to satisfy new information requests is an attractive strategy for extracting information from databases without involving database specialists. However, the reuse of information systems artifacts has been shown to be susceptible to the phenomenon of anchoring and adjustment. Anchoring often leads to a systematic adjustment bias in which people fail to make sufficient changes to an anchor in response to the needs of a new task. In a study involving 157 novice query writers from six universities, we examined the effect of this phenomenon on the reuse of Structured Query Language (SQL) queries under varying levels of domain familiarity and for different types of anchors. Participants developed SQL queries to respond to four information requests in a familiar domain and four information requests in an unfamiliar domain. For two information requests in each domain, participants were also provided with sample queries (anchors) that answered similar information requests. We found evidence that the opportunity to reuse sample queries resulted in an adjustment bias leading to poorer quality query results and greater overconfidence in the correctness of results. The results also indicate that the strength of the adjustment bias depends on a combination of domain familiarity and type of anchor. This study demonstrates that anchoring and adjustment during query reuse can lead to queries that are less accurate than those written from scratch. We also extend the concept of anchoring and adjustment by distinguishing between surface-structure and deep-structure anchors and by considering the impact of domain familiarity on the adjustment bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0189","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of database query reuse and adjustment bias without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Why do competing sellers adopt different pricing schemes for the same information good? Pricing schemes affect buyers' usage levels and thus the revenue generated from different segments of buyers. This can allow competing firms in a duopoly to differentiate themselves by offering different pricing schemes. Such strategic use of pricing schemes can allow undifferentiated sellers to earn substantial profits in a friction-free market for a commoditized information good. These conditions would otherwise lead to the Bertrand equilibrium and zero profits. We show that adopting asymmetric pricing schemes can be a Nash equilibrium for information goods with negligible marginal cost of production. We extend our model to the case of information goods that are horizontally differentiated and show that sellers will offer a single-pricing scheme that is different from competitors when the sellers are weakly differentiated. When the sellers are strongly differentiated, each seller will offer multiple pricing schemes. We show that it can be optimal for a seller to offer multiple pricing schemes\u2014metered and flat fee pricing schemes, even in the absence of transactions costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0203","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing schemes and market strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While extensively detailed contracts are likely to include a greater breadth of activities outsourced to a vendor, task complexity makes it difficult to draft extensive contracts. Furthermore, extensive contracts may still be incomplete with respect to enforcement.

While the pay-for-performance format substantially reduces the wastage incurred by advertisers compared to traditional pay-per-exposure advertising formats, the reduction of such wastage also carries the risk of reducing the signaling properties of advertising. Lacking a separating equilibrium, low-quality firms in these markets may be able to mimic the advertising strategies of high-quality firms. This study examines this issue in the context of online sponsored search markets. Using data gathered from sponsored search auctions for keywords in a market without intervention by the intermediary, we find evidence of adverse selection for products/services characterized by high uncertainty. On the other hand, there is no evidence of adverse selection for similar products in a regulated sponsored search market, suggesting that intervention by the search intermediary can have a significant impact on market outcomes and consumer welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0222","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['consumer welfare', 'intervention', 'adverse selection']","The article discusses market outcomes and consumer welfare but lacks a strong focus on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

However, contracting a software project to an outside developer is often quite challenging because of information asymmetry and incentive divergence. A typical software development contract must deal with a variety of interrelated issues such as the quality of the developed system, the timeliness of delivery, the effort and cost associated with the project, the contract payment, and the postdelivery software support. This paper presents a contract-theoretic model that incorporates these factors to analyze how software outsourcing contracts can be designed. We find that despite their relative inefficiency, fixed-price contracts are often appropriate for simple software projects that require short development time. Time-and-materials contracts work well for more complex projects when the auditing process is efficient and effective. We also examine a type of performance-based contract called quality-level agreement and find that the first-best solution can be reached with such a contract. Finally, we consider profit-sharing contracts that are useful in situations where the developer has more bargaining power.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0223","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software outsourcing contracts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper examines the design of keyword auctions, a novel mechanism that keyword advertising providers such as Google and Yahoo! use to allocate advertising slots. In our keyword auction model, advertisers bid their willingness-to-pay per click on their advertisements, and the advertising provider can weight advertisers' bids differently and require different minimum bids based on advertisers' click-generating potential. We study the impact and design of such weighting schemes and minimum-bid policies. We find that weighting scheme determines how advertisers with different click-generating potential match in equilibrium. Minimum bids exclude low-valuation advertisers and at the same time may distort the equilibrium matching. The efficient design of keyword auctions requires weighting advertisers' bids by their expected click-through-rates, and requires the same minimum weighted bids. The revenue-maximizing weighting scheme may or may not favor advertisers with low click-generating potential. The revenue-maximizing minimum-bid policy differs from those prescribed in the standard auction design literature. Keyword auctions that employ the revenue-maximizing weighting scheme and differentiated minimum bid policy can generate higher revenue than standard fixed-payment auctions. We draw managerial implications for pay-per-click and other pay-for-performance auctions and discuss potential applications to other areas.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0225","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of keyword auctions and advertising mechanisms without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or DEI themes.

Software vulnerability disclosure, which refers to the publication of vulnerability information, has generated intense debate. An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of software vendors. How quickly do vendors patch vulnerabilities and how does disclosure affect patch release time? This paper compiles a unique data set from the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT) and SecurityFocus to answer this question. Our results suggest that disclosure accelerates patch release. The instantaneous probability of releasing the patch rises by nearly two and a half times because of disclosure. Open source vendors release patches more quickly than closed source vendors. Vendors are more responsive to more severe vulnerabilities. We also find that vendors respond more slowly to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT. We verify our results by using another publicly available data set and find that results are consistent.

We do so by modeling firms in a three-tier value chain consisting of buyers, intermediaries, and suppliers, who can interact using IOS that lower the procurement search costs associated with finding appropriate trading partners. In the context of complex business-to-business (B2B) search, we study how decreasing search costs affect a firm's decision to insource or outsource the procurement function, depending on whether the search process is information intensive or communication intensive. Variation in search costs changes the transaction costs of interaction between firms, as well as the contracting costs associated with outsourcing, owing to changes in the costs of moral hazard for delegated search. We study these effects in a new model that integrates search theory into the principal-agent framework, and establish that the optimal outsourcing contract has a simple \u201call or nothing\u201d performance-based structure under fairly general assumptions. Our model predicts that when B2B search is information intensive, IOS will facilitate an increase in outsourcing, market-based transactions, and a reduction in the vertical scope of extended enterprises. In contrast, when B2B search is primarily communication intensive, IOS will lead to tighter integration and an increase in the vertical scope of the extended enterprise. Our research suggests that the nature of the information technologies and of the business activities supported by IOS are crucial determinants of the organizational and industry changes they induce, and our results have important implications for a variety of industries in which both technological and agency issues will influence the eventual success of global IT-facilitated extended enterprise initiatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0235","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of interorganizational systems and outsourcing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In organizations, social network analysis techniques are being applied to a number of domains, particularly the understanding of knowledge stocks and flows. Because this information is generated from large data sets, computerized visualizations of it are very helpful for accomplishing these complex tasks. This paper presents a model for evaluating the effectiveness of network visualizations based on theories of cognitive fit, working memory capacity, and information load.

However, such data are not always obtainable and observational (cross-sectional, nonexperimental) data are often the only data available. To infer causality from observational data that are common in empirical IS research, this study develops a new data analysis method that integrates the Bayesian networks (BN) and structural equation modeling (SEM) literatures. Similar to SEM techniques (e.g., LISREL and PLS), the proposed Bayesian networks for latent variables (BN-LV) method tests both the measurement model and the structural model. The method operates in two stages: First, it inductively identifies the most likely LVs from measurement items without prespecifying a measurement model. Second, it compares all the possible structural models among the identified LVs in an exploratory (automated) fashion and it discovers the most likely causal structure. By exploring the causal structural model that is not restricted to linear relationships, BN-LV contributes to the empirical IS literature by overcoming three SEM limitations (Lee, B., A. Barua, A. B. Whinston. 1997. Discovery and representation of causal relationships in MIS research: A methodological framework. MIS Quart.21(1) 109\u2013136)\u2014lack of causality inference, restrictive model structure, and lack of nonlinearities. Moreover, BN-LV extends the BN literature by (1) overcoming the problem of latent variable identification using observed (raw) measurement items as the only inputs, and (2) enabling the use of ordinal and discrete (Likert-type) data, which are commonly used in empirical IS studies. The BN-LV method is first illustrated and tested with actual empirical data to demonstrate how it can help reconcile competing hypotheses in terms of the direction of causality in a structural model. Second, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of BN-LV compared to existing techniques in the SEM and BN literatures. The advantages of BN-LV in terms of measurement model construction and structural model discovery are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0224","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for causal inference in data analysis without any mention of social themes, ethics, or DEI.

In providing personalized services, a website is typically faced with the following trade-off: When serving a visitor's request, it can deliver an optimally personalized version of the content to the visitor, possibly with a long delay because of the computational effort needed, or it can deliver a suboptimal version of the content more quickly. This problem becomes more complex when several requests are waiting for information from a server. The website then needs to trade off the benefit from providing more personalized content to each user with the negative externalities associated with higher waiting costs for all other visitors that have requests pending. We examine several deterministic resource allocation policies in such personalization contexts. We identify an optimal policy for the above problem when requests to be scheduled are batched, and show that the policy can be very efficiently implemented in practice. We provide an experimental approach to determine optimal batch lengths, and demonstrate that it performs favorably when compared with viable queueing approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0230","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and personalization without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

New Evidence and New Results","Prior research at the firm level finds information technology (IT) to be a net substitute for both labor and non-IT capital inputs. However, it is unclear whether these results hold, given recent IT innovations and continued price declines. In this study we extend prior research to examine whether these input relationships have evolved over time. First, we introduce new price indexes to account for varying technological progress across different types of IT hardware. Second, we use the rental price methodology to measure capital in terms of the flow of services provided.

Analyzing approximately 9,800 observations from over 800 Fortune 1,000 firms for the years 1987\u20131998, we find firm demand for IT to be elastic for decentralized IT and inelastic for centralized IT. Moreover, Allen Elasticity of Substitution estimates confirm that through labor substitution, the increasing factor share of IT comes at the expense of labor. Last, we identify a complementary relationship between IT and ordinary capital, suggesting an evolution in this relationship as firms have shifted to more decentralized organizational forms.

A key competitive dynamics question for many organizations is how to build a competitive advantage in turbulence with digital IT systems. The literature has focused mostly on developing and exercising dynamic capabilities for planned reconfiguration of existing operational capabilities in fairly stable environments with patterned \u201cwaves,\u201d but this may not always be possible, or even appropriate, in highly turbulent environments with unexpected \u201cstorms.\u201d We introduce improvisational capabilities as an alternative means for managing highly turbulent environments; we define this as the ability to spontaneously reconfigure existing resources to build new operational capabilities to address urgent, unpredictable, and novel environmental situations. In contrast to the planned role of dynamic and operational capabilities and the ambidexterity that they jointly offer, improvisational capabilities are proposed to operate distinctly as a \u201cthird hand\u201d that facilitates reconfiguration and change in highly turbulent environments. First, the paper develops the notion of improvisational capabilities and articulates the key differences between the two \u201creconfiguration\u201d\u2014improvisational and dynamic\u2014capabilities. Second, the paper compares the relative effects of improvisational and dynamic capabilities in the context of new product development in different levels of environmental turbulence. Third, the paper shows how IT-leveraging capability in new product development is decomposed into its three digital IT systems: project and resource management systems, organizational memory systems (OMS), and cooperative work systems\u2014and how each of these IT systems enhances improvisational capabilities, an effect that is accentuated in highly turbulent environments. The results show that although dynamic capabilities are the primary predictor of competitive advantage in moderately turbulent environments, improvisational capabilities fully dominate in highly turbulent environments. Besides discriminant validity, the distinction between improvisational and dynamic capabilities is evidenced by the differential effects of IT-leveraging capability on improvisational and dynamic capabilities. The results show that the more the IT-leveraging capability is catered toward managing resources (through project and resource management systems) and team collaboration (through cooperative work systems) rather than relying on past knowledge and procedures (through organizational memory systems), the more it is positively associated with improvisational capabilities, particularly in more turbulent environments. The paper draws implications for how different IT systems can influence improvisational capabilities and competitive advantage in turbulent environments, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of IT systems on reconfiguration capabilities. The paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of building and exercising the \u201cthird hand\u201d of improvisational capabilities for IT-enabled competitive dynamics in turbulence.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0280","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['competitive advantage', 'improvisational capabilities', 'turbulence']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of IT systems and competitive dynamics without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Capabilities, Competitive Actions, and Firm Survival in the Software Industry from 1995 to 2007","This study examines why firms fail or survive in the volatile software industry. We provide a novel perspective by considering how software firms' capabilities and their competitive actions affect their ultimate survival. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we conceptualize capabilities as a firm's ability to efficiently transform input resources into outputs, relative to its peers. We define three critical capabilities of software-producing firms\u2014research and development (RD), marketing (MK), and operations (OP)\u2014and hypothesize that in the dynamic, high-technology software industry, RD and MK capabilities are most important for firm survival. We then draw on the competitive dynamics literature to theorize that competitive actions distinguished by a greater emphasis on innovation-related moves will increase firm survival more than actions emphasizing resource-related moves. Finally, we postulate that firms' capabilities will complement their competitive actions in affecting firm survival. Our empirical evaluation examines a cross-sectional, time series panel of 5,827 observations on 870 software companies from 1995 to 2007. We use a stochastic frontier production function to measure the capability for each software firm in each time period. We then use the Cox proportional hazard regression technique to relate capabilities and competitive actions to software firms' failure rates. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that higher OP capability increases software firm survival more than higher MK and RD capabilities. Further, firms with a greater emphasis on innovation-related than resource-related competitive actions have a greater likelihood of survival, and this likelihood increases even further when these firms have higher MK and OP capabilities. Additional analyses of subsectors within the software industry reveal that firms producing visual applications (e.g., graphical and video game software) have the highest MK capability but the lowest OP and RD capabilities and make twice as many innovation-related as resource-related moves. These firms have the highest market values but the worst Altman Z scores, suggesting that they are valued highly but also are at high risk for failure, and indeed the firms in this sector fail at a greater rate than expected. In contrast, firms producing traditional decision-support applications and infrastructure software have different capabilities and make different competitive moves. Our findings suggest that the firms that persist and survive over the long term in the dynamic software industry are able to capitalize on their competitive actions because of their greater capabilities, and particularly OP capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0281","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of firm survival in the software industry, emphasizing capabilities and competitive actions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","21","3","Sulin BaSulin Basulin.ba@business.uconn.eduSchool of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269Search for more papers by this author, Jan StallaertJan Stallaertjan.stallaert@business.uconn.eduSchool of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269Search for more papers by this author, Zhongju ZhangZhongju Zhangjohn.zhang@business.uconn.eduSchool of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269Search for more papers by this author","Balancing IT with the Human Touch: Optimal Investment in IT-Based Customer Service","To cut costs, companies have chosen to deliver a variety of service offerings online.

Whereas h-service has total costs that increase with the demand for services, e-service mainly requires a fixed investment upfront, which can be amortized over the totality of customers served. Considering the different nature of the costs of h-service and e-service and the heterogeneity of customer preferences for services, we derive the optimal mix of h-service and e-service for a service-providing company vis-\u00e0-vis its competitor. Our theoretical analysis finds the subgame-perfect Nash equilibria that determines the optimal positions in a duopoly setting. We further study the competitive dynamics of the system to examine how firms stay on the equilibrium paths. Using simulation, we investigate the effects of starting positions, small adjustments in h-service and/or e-service, and monotonic expansions of e-service on the final positioning and profits of the firms. Our results demonstrate that when firms follow a local best-reply strategy, they may end up in a position of low profitability, and when only monotonic expansions of e-service are allowed, both firms may end up overinvesting in e-service.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0282","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['customer service', 'digital systems', 'human-based service']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of optimizing service delivery between human and digital systems, with no significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

However, there is a need to understand factors that enable firms to undertake competitive actions. In this study, we focus on two antecedents of competitive behavior of firms: (1) access to network resources and (2) use of information technology (IT). We argue that while network structure provides firms with the opportunity to tap into external resources, the extent to which they are actually exploited depends on firms' IT-enabled capability. We develop a theoretical model that examines the relationships between IT-enabled capability, network structure, and competitive action. We test the model using secondary data, about 12 major automakers over 16 years from 1988 to 2003. We find that network structure rich in structural holes has a positive direct effect on firms' ability to introduce a greater number and a wider range of competitive actions. However, the effect of dense network structure is contingent on firms' IT-enabled capability. Firms benefit from dense network structure only when they develop a strong IT-enabled capability. Our results suggest that IT-enabled capability plays both a substitutive role, when firms do not have advantageous access to brokerage opportunities, and a complementary role, when firms are embedded in dense network structure, in the relationship between network structure and competitive actions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0296","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics and the role of information technology and network structure in business performance, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","21","3","K.

These innovation outcomes are often labeled as competitive actions aggressively undertaken by firms to gain market share or to achieve profitability. We use secondary data about IT-enabled knowledge capabilities and innovation outcomes of 110 firms.

However, the systems of information technology (IT) and process capabilities that firms should develop to manage IR portfolios dynamically are not well-understood. In order to theorize how key structural IT capabilities (IT integration and IT reconfiguration) and competitive process capabilities (process alignment, partnering flexibility, and offering flexibility) operate as systems of complements, we draw on the competitive dynamics perspective and resource dependency theory and on the literature for IT business value, interorganizational systems, and interorganizational relationship management. We also theorize how a firm's IR portfolio moderates the effects of structural IT capabilities on competitive process capabilities and why a firm's environmental turbulence moderates the effects of complementary process capabilities on competitive performance. We test our model using survey data from 318 firms in 4 industries. Our results provide broad support for the following: (1) structural IT capabilities and process capabilities operating as a system of complements, (2) the effects of structural IT capabilities on competitive process capabilities being contingent on IR portfolio concentration, and (3) the effects of complementary process capabilities on competitive performance being contingent on environmental turbulence. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of how firms should develop complementary systems of structural IT capabilities and competitive process capabilities to manage IR portfolios dynamically and leverage external resources.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0299","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['interorganizational relationships', 'competitive advantage', 'resource dependency']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of IT capabilities and competitive processes without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

ESS firms offer software components (e.g., ERP, CRM, Marketing analytics) to shape their clients' digitization strategies. With rapid rates of technological and market innovation, the ESS industry consists of several horizontal markets that form around these components. As numerous vendors compete with each other within and across these markets, many of these horizontal markets appear to be crowded with rivals. In fact, multimarket contact and presence in crowded markets appear to be the pathways through which a majority of the ESS firms compete. Though the strategy literature has demonstrated the virtues of multimarket contact, paradoxically, the same literature argues that operating in crowded markets is not wise. In particular, crowded markets increase a firm's exposure to the whirlwinds of intense competition and have deleterious consequences for financial performance. Thus, the behavior of ESS firms raises an interesting anomaly and research question: Why do ESS firms continue to compete in crowded markets if they are deemed to be bad for financial performance? We argue that the effects of rivalry in crowded markets are counteracted by a different force, in the form of the economics of demand externalities. Demand externalities occur because the customers of ESS firms expect that software components from one market will be easily integrated with those that they buy from other markets. However, with rapid rates of technological innovation and market formation and dissolution, customers experience significant ambiguity in deciding which markets and components suit their needs. Therefore, they look at crowded markets as an important signal about the legitimacy and viability of specific components for their needs. Through their presence in crowded markets, ESS firms can signal their commitment to many of the components that customers might need for their digital platforms. Customers might find that such firms are attractive because their commitments to crowded markets can mitigate concerns about compatibilities between the components purchased across several markets. This unique potential for demand externality across markets suggests that ESS vendors might, in fact, benefit from competing in many crowded markets. We test our explanations through data across three time periods from a set of ESS firms that account for more than 95% of the revenue in this market. We find that ESS firms do reap performance benefits by competing in crowded markets. More importantly, we find that they can enhance their benefits from crowded markets if they face the same competitors in multiple markets, thereby increasing their multimarket contact with rivals. These results have interesting implications not just for understanding competitive conduct in the ESS industry but also in many of the emerging digital goods industries where the markets have similar competitive characteristics to the ESS industry. Our ideas complement emerging ideas about platform models of competition in the digital goods industry and provide important directions for future research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0300","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on competitive strategies and market dynamics within the enterprise systems software industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Findings suggest that when managers envision information systems as a resource that provides opportunities for competitive actions rather than viewing information systems in a service role, competitive advantages will evolve.

In particular, we focus on a context in which the combined search engine company competes with a market leader holding a larger share of the market than the two runner-up \u201cunderdogs\u201d combined.

Another noteworthy finding is that a nonlinear association exists between NI and an alliance outcome; the combined runner-up companies have the best chance of success when the extent of NI is midrange, rather than on the high or low end of continuum. Contrary to the conventional view, this finding might also stimulate discussions among network science researchers.

However, little research has examined the consequences of control mode choices on project performance. This paper reports on a study that addresses this issue in the context of outsourced software projects. In addition, we propose that boundary-spanning activities between the vendor and the client enable knowledge sharing across organizational and knowledge domain boundaries. This is expected to lead to facilitation of control through specific incentives and performance norms that are suited to client needs as well as the vendor context. Therefore, we argue that boundary spanning between the vendor and client moderates the relationship between formal controls instituted by the vendor on the development team and project performance. We also hypothesize the effect of collaboration as a clan control on project performance. We examine project performance in terms of software quality and project efficiency. The research model is empirically tested in the Indian software industry setting on a sample of 96 projects. The results suggest that formal and informal control modes have a significant impact on software project outcomes, but need to be finely tuned and directed toward appropriate objectives. In addition, boundary-spanning activities significantly improve the effectiveness of formal controls.

Although bidding strategies and bidder behavior in single auctions have been extensively studied, limited research exists on bidding in sequential auctions. We seek to explain how bidders in such an environment learn from the information, and form and update their willingness to pay (WTP). Using a large data set from an online auction retailer, we analyze the evolution of the bidders' WTP as well as the effect of auction design on bidders' WTP in sequential auctions. We see our study in the context of a longitudinal field experiment, in which we were able to track actions of repeat bidders over an extended period of time. Our results show that bidders' WTP in sequential auctions can be explained from their demand characteristics, their participation experience in previous auctions, outcomes in previous auctions, and auction design parameters. We also observe, characterize, and measure what we call a modified demand reduction effect exhibited across different auctions, over time, by multiunit demand bidders. Our findings are important to enable better auction mechanism design, and more sophisticated bidding tools that explore the rich information environment of sequential auctions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0216","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding behavior and auction design without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2010","21","4","De LiuDe Liude.liu@uky.eduUniversity of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40506Search for more papers by this author, Gautam RayGautam Rayrayxx153@umn.eduUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455Search for more papers by this author, Andrew B.

However, the extant literature has paid limited attention to the interaction between them. This research draws on the literature on formal modeling of networks to examine the interaction between knowledge codification and knowledge-sharing networks. The analysis suggests that an increase in codification may damage existing network-sharing ties. Anticipating that, individuals may hoard their knowledge to protect their network ties, even when there are nontrivial rewards for codification. We find that despite the aforementioned tension between the codification and the network approach, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches. Specifically, when the future sharing potential between knowledge workers is high, a combination of the two approaches may outperform a codification-only or a network-only approach because the codification reward causes fewer network ties to break down, and the benefit from increased codification can offset the loss of some network ties. However, when the future sharing potential is low, an increase in codification reward can quickly break down the whole network. Thus, firms may be better off by pursuing a codification-only or a network-only strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0217","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['knowledge-sharing', 'codification', 'networks']","The article primarily focuses on knowledge management strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study explores the important, but seldom studied, topic of collaborative online shopping. It investigates two design components that are pertinent to collaborative online shopping support tools, namely, navigation support and communication support. Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that compared to separate navigation, shared navigation effectively reduces uncoupling (i.e., the loss of coordination with one's shopping partner) incidents per product discussed and leads to fewer communication exchanges dedicated to resolving each uncoupling incident, thereby enhancing coordination performance. Compared to text chat, voice chat does not help reduce the occurrence of uncoupling, but likely increases the efficiency in resolving uncoupling. The results further show that shared navigation and voice chat can significantly enhance the collaborative shoppers' perceptions of social presence derived from their online shopping experiences. The interaction effect on social presence implies that the benefit of shared navigation is higher in the presence of text chat than in the presence of voice chat.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0218","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['collaborative', 'social presence', 'communication']","The article discusses collaborative online shopping, which touches on themes of social interaction and communication, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Even if it forms the core of an organization's information systems (IS) infrastructure, there is little prior IS research on the competitive dynamics in this industry. Whereas economic modeling has generally provided the methodological framework for studying standards-driven industries, our research employs social network methods to empirically examine ESS firm competition. Although component compatibility is critical to organizational end users, there is an absence of industry-wide ESS standards and compatibility is ensured through interfirm alliances. First, our research observes that this alliance network does not conform to the equilibrium structures predicted by economics of network evolution supporting the view that it is difficult to identify dominant standards and leaders in this industry. This state of flux combined with the multifirm multicomponent nature of the industry limits the direct applicability of extant analytical models. Instead, we propose that the relative structural position acquired by a firm in its alliance network is a reasonable proxy for its standards dominance and is an indicator of its performance. In lieu of structural measures developed mainly for interpersonal networks, we develop a measure of relative firm prominence specifically for the business software network where benefits of alliances may accrue through indirect connections even if attenuated. Panel data analyses of ESS firms that account for over 95% of the industry revenues, show that our measure provides a superior model fit to extant social network measures. Two interesting counterintuitive findings emerge from our research. First, unlike other software industries compatibility considerations can trump rivalry concerns. We employ quadratic assignment procedure to show that firms freely form alliances even with their rivals. Second, we find that smaller firms enjoy a greater value from acquiring a higher structural position as compared to larger firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0278","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics and performance in the enterprise systems software industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We revise the strategic alignment quest to propose a co-evolution quest that addresses not only competitive strategy questions of a firm but also corporate strategy questions. The co-evolution quest seeks to increase a firm's agility and dynamism in repositioning itself, identifying profitable product-market positions as the evolving competitive landscape erodes the profitability of the firm's existing positions. To support the co-evolution quest, we revise the integration quest and propose a reconfiguration quest that encompasses not only business processes but also products and services, as well as the contracts, resources, and transactions associated with them. As the firm makes repositioning moves to co-evolve with the competitive landscape, the reconfiguration quest seeks to increase the firm's agility in disintegrating its existing nexus of contracts, resources, and transactions that support the old positions and in reconfiguring new ones that support the new positions. Finally, we revise the sustained competitive advantage quest to propose a renewal quest that recognizes the temporary nature of competitive advantage in CABS. The renewal quest seeks to destabilize the firm's old sources of competitive advantage when competitive dynamics erode their utility, rapidly create new sources of competitive advantage, and concatenate a series of temporary advantages over time. The three reframed quests provide the foundation for a research agenda on IS strategy in CABS.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0317","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['agility', 'dynamic', 'co-evolution']","The article discusses the need for agility and dynamic strategies in response to changing competitive landscapes, which hints at a broader understanding of organizational adaptability.

Vigilant interactions are critical in online knowledge collaborations under ambivalent relationships where users collaborate to gain benefits but at the same time protect to avoid harm from perceived vulnerabilities. Vigilant interactions can take place on discussion boards, open source development, wiki sites, social media sites, and online knowledge management systems and thus is a rich research area for information systems researchers.

Accordingly, we need to change the way we examine how information technology (IT) can help organizations build a strategic advantage in turbulent environments. We propose a more systemic and holistic perspective to theory building and testing in the information system (IS) strategy area and correspondingly appropriate methods that capture the complexity of this phenomenon. We term this phenomenon digital ecodynamics, defined as the holistic confluence among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems\u2014and their fused dynamic interactions unfolding as an ecosystem. We believe that a more holistic understanding of digital ecodynamics will fuel the next leap in knowledge in the IS strategy area. First, extending the strategic management literature that has mainly focused on two-way interactions between environmental turbulence and dynamic capabilities, we foreground IT systems as a third central element. We use a \u201cthreesome tango\u201d analogy1 with strong mutual interdependence to accentuate our view of digital ecodynamics\u2014while also stressing the emerging role of IT systems in triggering environmental turbulence and shaping dynamic capabilities to build a strategic advantage. Second, we propose a different paradigmatic lens (configuration theories) as an appropriate inquiring system to better understand the complexity of digital ecodynamics. The paper articulates the key aspects of configuration theories as inquiring systems, compares them with the more common variance theories and process theories, and illustrates the power of recent advances in configurational methods. Third, we create a preliminary roadmap for IS researchers to better examine digital ecodynamics using novel structural properties afforded by configuration theories (i.e., mutual causality, discontinuity, punctuated equilibria, nonlinear change). Fourth, we reflect on the broader opportunities that the configurational perspective of digital ecodynamics can create for IS strategy research. The paper ends by highlighting the double-barreled opportunity that digital ecodynamics renders, both as an energizing vision for IS strategy research and also as a reshaper of strategic management research and practice in a turbulent and digitized world.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0326","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['environmental turbulence', 'strategic advantage', 'holistic perspective']","The article discusses the intersection of digital technologies and environmental factors, suggesting a need for a more holistic approach to information systems.

While major strides have been achieved in the last decade in the information systems (IS) and strategic management literature in improving our understanding of outsourcing, the focus has been on a dyadic relationship between a client and a vendor. We demonstrate that a straightforward extrapolation of such a dyadic relationship falls short of addressing the nuanced incentive-effort-output linkages that arise when multiple vendors, who are competitors, have to cooperate and coordinate to achieve the client's business objectives. We suggest that when multiple vendors have to work together to deliver end-to-end services to a client, the choice of formal incentives and relational governance mechanisms depends on the degree of interdependence between the various tasks as well as the observability and verifiability of output. With respect to cooperation, we find that a vendor must not only put effort in a \u201cprimary\u201d task it is responsible for but also cooperate through \u201chelping\u201d effort in enabling other vendors perform their primary tasks. In the context of coordination, we find that task redesign for modularity, OLAs, and governance structures such as the guardian vendor model represent important avenues for further research. Based on the analysis of actual multisourcing contract details over the last decade, interviews with leading practitioners, and a review of the single-sourcing literature, we lay a foundation for normative theories of multisourcing and present a research agenda in this domain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0328","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['governance', 'cooperation', 'coordination']","The article discusses governance and cooperation among vendors in a multisourcing context, which touches on organizational ethics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

We use an experiment to study the problem of motivating firm productivity, which depends on levels of owner investment and employee productive effort, when managers have an incentive to favor the owner's interests over those of the employee. Drawing on research in psychology and behavioral economics, we argue that reputation concerns can more effectively promote firm productivity when manager compensation is relatively insensitive to how much the owner is allocated after production occurs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that reputation concerns lead to greater firm productivity and higher payoffs for all firm members, but only when manager pay is relatively insensitive to the owner's ex post allocation. In addition to offering testable empirical implications, our theory and results are important because they can help explain why executive compensation is, in practice, surprisingly insensitive to owner returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00352.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['fair', 'trust', 'employee', 'management', 'reputation']","The article discusses fairness in the context of management and employee relationships, which touches on ethical themes.

Our evidence supports this optimal investment hypothesis: (1) adding an investment factor into standard factor regressions substantially reduces the magnitude of the accrual anomaly, often to insignificant levels; (2) accruals covary negatively with discount rate estimates from the dividend discounting model, and for the most part, with estimates from the residual income model; (3) accruals with low accounting reliability covary more with capital investment than accruals with high accounting reliability; and (iv) expected returns to accruals-based trading strategies are time-varying, suggesting that the deterioration of the accrual effect in recent years might be temporary and likely to mean-revert in the near future.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00353.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and investment strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2010","48","1","EDMUND KEUNG,\u00a0\n                     EDMUND KEUNG\n                     NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.Search for more papers by this authorZHI-XING LIN,\u00a0\n                     ZHI-XING LIN\n                     NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.Search for more papers by this authorMICHAEL SHIH,\u00a0\n                     MICHAEL SHIH\n                     NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.Search for more papers by this author","Does the Stock Market See a Zero or Small Positive Earnings Surprise as a Red Flag?","This study shows that firms collectively incur a cost for managing earnings and analyst expectations to meet earnings forecasts.

The ERC for earnings surprises in the range [0, 1\u00a2] is significantly lower than ERCs for earnings surprises in adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the early and mid 2000s, but not for those in the 1990s. The results are robust to controlling for the sign of estimated discretionary accruals and the trajectory of analyst earnings forecasts. We further find that investors are right to be skeptical about earnings surprises in the range [0, 1\u00a2].

Alternatively, managers may have an incentive to report loss inflating discretionary reserves to reduce the cost of regulatory rate suppression. We find insurers over-state reserves in the presence of stringent rate regulation. Investigating the impact along the conditional reserve error distribution, we discover that a majority of the response occurs from under-reserving firms under-reserving less because of stringent rate regulation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00358.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices related to regulatory processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Covenants are expected to constrain managerial opportunism, however, only if the accounting system recognizes economic losses in earnings in a timely fashion. Thus, the demand for timely loss recognition should increase with a contract's reliance on covenants.

Consistent with this conjecture, I find that female analysts issue bolder and more accurate forecasts and their accuracy is higher in market segments in which their concentration is lower. Further, the stock market participants are aware of the male\u2013female skill differences. They respond more strongly to the forecast revisions by female analysts even though those analysts get less media coverage. The short-term market reaction is incomplete, however, because it is followed by a strong post-revision drift. The perception of abilities is similar in the analyst labor market, where female analysts are more likely to move up to high-status brokerage firms, while their downward career mobility is lower. Collectively, these results indicate that female analysts have better-than-average skill due to self-selection and market participants are at least partially able to recognize their superior abilities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00362.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","6","['female analysts', 'discrimination', 'skill differences', 'self-selection']","The article discusses gender differences in the forecasting abilities of analysts, highlighting issues of discrimination and the self-selection of female analysts into the profession.

Results are consistent with analysts anticipating that transient institutional investors are more likely than dedicated institutional investors to adjust their trading strategies for near-term factors affecting stock mispricings.

Two experiments observe the information-search behavior of auditors responsible for investigating their firm's prior opinion. Experiment 1 shows that auditors confronted with few (many) summarized statements that replicate in form the materials used in prior research prefer to first search statements that are inconsistent (consistent) with the prior-period accounting. This result generally corroborates research in accounting and confirms the predictions of information-quantity theory in psychology. In contrast, experiment 1 also shows that, when materials mimic the detailed documents common in practice, the results are different: Auditors confronted either with few or with many detailed documents prefer to search inconsistent documents first. This result confirms the predictions of evidence-complexity theory in psychology and shows that, compared to the materials on which prior research relies, detailed documents, such as memos, emails, letters, and analyses, drive information search toward inconsistent evidence. Experiment 2 probes further and finds that auditors evaluate documents bearing notes inscribed after the documents were prepared to be more inconsistent with the prior-period accounting, and that the dispersion in search behavior may be reliably conditional on the presence of notes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2010.00366.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The paper predicts that for many, but not all, processes describing the distribution of their firms' cash flows, when subject to such reporting requirements, managers will engage in disclosure \u201cbunching,\u201d that is, they will bunch the discretionary component of the information they acquire and disclose into a single point in time rather than spread the acquisition and disclosure of that information over time. We show that managers' preferred bunching period depends on managers' strategy for trading in their firms' shares, managers' risk aversion, the risk premium the capital market attaches to firms' shares, and the size of managers' initial ownership stakes in their firms. We also study and characterize how the equilibrium prices of firms' shares vary over time and also how managers' optimal trading strategies vary with their most preferred \u201cbunching\u201d strategies.

I find that managers of cash-constrained firms with incentives to defer cash payments are more likely to finance asset purchases with synthetic leases. The mandated reporting for synthetic leases allows managers to avoid disclosing the financial consequences of these transactions. Managers of firms with incentives to use off-balance-sheet financing do not provide transparent disclosure about their synthetic leases. However, managers of cash-constrained firms, which are less likely to use synthetic leases for financial reporting reasons, do voluntarily disclose the existence and financial consequences of these contracts.

Our results show that investors rely on an earnings measure only when it is consistent over time. When both measures are consistent over time, investors use them in an additive fashion, suggesting that they view them as providing different information about the firm. Further tests show that investors believe that earnings trend and benchmark performance both provide information about a firm's future prospects and management's credibility.

In contrast, CFOs of firms with strong internal controls receive higher compensation and do not experience significant changes in forced turnover rates. These results are consistent with the \u201cdisclosure of type\u201d hypothesis, which suggests that the mandatory internal control disclosures under SOX are a credible mechanism that effectively distinguishes good CFOs from bad ones by revealing the firm's internal control quality.

The return forecasting power of aggregate discretionary accruals is robust to choices of sample periods, return measurements, estimation methods, business condition and risk premium proxies, and accrual models used to isolate discretionary accruals. Our extensive analysis shows that aggregate discretionary accruals, in sharp contrast to aggregate normal accruals, contain little information about overall business conditions or aggregate cash flows and display little co-movement with ICAPM-motivated risk premium proxies. Our findings imply that aggregate discretionary accruals likely reflect aggregate fluctuations in earnings management, thereby favoring the behavioral explanation that managers time aggregate equity markets to report earnings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2010.00379.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and market returns without addressing any social issues, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2010","48","4","RAJIB DOOGAR,\u00a0\n                     RAJIB DOOGAR\n                     University of Illinois.Search for more papers by this authorPADMAKUMAR SIVADASAN,\u00a0\n                     PADMAKUMAR SIVADASAN\n                     University of Illinois.Search for more papers by this authorIRA SOLOMON,\u00a0\n                     IRA SOLOMON\n                     University of Illinois.Search for more papers by this author","The Regulation of Public Company Auditing: Evidence from the Transition to AS5","The replacement of Auditing Standard No. 2 (AS2) by Auditing Standard No. 5 (AS5) creates a natural experiment that sheds light on (1) potential inefficiencies caused by regulatory responses to a political crisis and (2) audit efficiency and effectiveness improvements resulting from the risk-based approach embodied in AS5.

I find that firms with better current performance, lower accruals, smaller size, lower market-to-book ratio, less return volatility, lower MD&A Fog index, and longer history tend to have more positive FLSs. The average tone of the FLS is positively associated with future earnings even after controlling for other determinants of future performance. The results also show that, despite increased regulations aimed at strengthening MD&A disclosures, there is no systematic change in the information content of MD&As over time. In addition, the tone in MD&As seems to mitigate the mispricing of accruals. When managers \u201cwarn\u201d about the future performance implications of accruals (i.e., the MD&A tone is positive (negative) when accruals are negative (positive)), accruals are not associated with future returns.

We focus instead on the CEO's decision rights and introduce a third option in which the incumbent CEO is removed but retained on the board for an extended period, which we call Retention Light. Firms may benefit from Retention Light because former CEOs possess unique monitoring and advising abilities, but the former CEO could also exploit available decision rights for personal benefit. A Retention Light CEO's decision rights generally exceed those of CEOs who exit the firm entirely but fall short of the rights of a retained CEO. We find that when prior firm performance is better, the former CEO is more likely to be retained on the board (Retention Light) than to exit the firm. However, this relation is weaker when the CEO reaches normal retirement age at which time CEO power becomes more important. We also provide evidence on how the nature of the CEO's bargaining power varies with his personal attributes and board characteristics in its influence on the Retention Light decision. Retention Light firms are more likely than CEO-exit firms to select a successor CEO with relatively weaker bargaining power. Finally, Retention Light involving a nonfounder CEO is negatively associated with the firm's postturnover financial performance. Overall, Retention Light is a distinct CEO turnover option that has important consequences for board decisions and firm performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2010.00383.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on CEO turnover decisions and board dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We isolate the timing of private information flows by estimating the speed of price discovery over quarterly earnings cycles in both secondary syndicated loan and equity markets. We identify borrowers disseminating private information to lenders relatively early in the cycle with firms exhibiting relatively early price discovery in the secondary loan market, documenting that price discovery is faster for loans subject to financial covenants, particularly earnings-based covenants; for borrowers who experience covenant violations; for borrowers with high credit risk; and for loans syndicated by relationship-based lenders or highly reputable lead arrangers. We then ask whether early access to private information in the loan market accelerates the speed of information arrival in stock prices. We document that the stock returns of firms identified with earlier private information dissemination to lenders indeed exhibit faster price discovery in the stock market, but only when institutional investors are involved in the firm's syndicated loans. Further, the positive relation between institutional lending and the speed of stock price discovery is more pronounced in relatively weak public disclosure environments.

We also hypothesize a negative relation between conservatism and the fraction of total loans a firm borrows from state-owned banks (SBs) because SBs have weaker demand for assurance of sufficient net assets to cover loan repayments than non-state-owned banks (NSBs). We find support for both hypotheses. Further analyses reveal that: (1) firms that borrow from commercial SBs exhibit more conservative accounting than firms that borrow from policy SBs and (2) firms adopt more conservative accounting as they get more loans from banks with foreign ownership or exclusively foreign banks.

The descriptive evidence indicates that removing transitory earnings is one principal concern in the measurement of earnings but not in the measurement of net worth. In the extreme, contracts are never written on comprehensive income as an earnings concept, whereas accumulated other comprehensive income is included in net worth in most contracts. In contrast, conservative adjustment, in the sense of including certain types of negative earnings but not the corresponding positive earnings, does not seem to be a primary consideration in measuring net income and net worth. Cross-sectionally, I find that net income is more likely to be defined differently from the GAAP when net income plays a more important role in a contract, when the loan maturity is longer, and when transitory earnings are less useful for debt contracting. Collectively, the evidence shows that debt contracting parties choose contracting variables in a manner consistent with efficient contracting, and that transitory earnings are relatively less useful in measuring firm performance for debt contracting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2010.00386.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt contracts and accounting definitions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We document that in some instances the presence of parity features prompts more favorable target evaluations (enhancement), whereas in others it results in more negative evaluations of the target (dilution). We predict when each of these outcomes will occur on the basis of a fit between an individual's regulatory goal focus and the means of goal pursuit depicted in the message presentation. Enhancement occurs when there is a fit between an individual's regulatory goal and how message information is presented, and dilution occurs when there is nonfit.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/1/112/1843827","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['brand evaluation', 'advertising', 'goal orientation']","The article primarily focuses on marketing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing social justice or ethical considerations.

We propose that both motivation to use self-goals, as indexed by need for cognition (NFC), and cognitive ability, manipulated through cognitive load, influence the use of the compromise heuristic. Three studies showed that NFC is associated with less compromise at baseline but not under load. Process measures and moderation tests suggest that load disrupts access to self-goals and that NFC relates to self-goal use. Thus, load differentially influences compromise choice across levels of NFC.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/1/137/1844177","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer research and heuristic decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that consumers draw inferences from the mere availability of add-ons, which in turn lead to significant changes in the perceived utility of the base good itself. Specifically, we propose that the improvements supplied by add-ons can be classified as either alignable or nonalignable and that they have opposing effects on evaluation. A set of four experiments with different product categories confirms this prediction. In addition, we show that the amount of product information available to consumers and expectations about product composition play important moderating roles. From a practical standpoint, these results highlight the need for firms to be mindful of the behavioral implications of making add-ons readily available in the marketplace.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/1/17/1844396","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product evaluations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Drawing on recent research on the endowment effect, we demonstrate that even when the differential costs implicit in ownership are controlled for, consumers are more likely to actually consume a product past its freshness date when they own it than when they do not. Moreover, this ownership-based increase in consumption is accompanied by lower estimates by consumers of their likelihood of getting sick from consuming the product past its freshness date. These outcomes are driven, in turn, by consumers' ownership-based susceptibility to engage in selective and confirmatory testing of the hypothesis that the product past its freshness date is consumption worthy (i.e., approach goal) rather than the alternate, default hypothesis that it is not consumption worthy (i.e., avoidance goal).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/1/47/1844739","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product freshness and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The present research shows that consumers often fail to predict hedonic adaptation to products and explores the antecedents and consequences of this misprediction. We demonstrate that the failure to predict diminishing enjoyment with a product arises because of a failure to spontaneously consider adaptation and apply correct intuitive beliefs about adaptation. We further show that making prospective duration salient can cue beliefs about hedonic adaptation. Finally, we find that these beliefs, once cued, influence choices.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/149/1942710","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product enjoyment without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Yet, in spite of most consumers\u2019 extensive experience with watching television, we propose that commercial interruptions can actually improve the television-viewing experience. Although consumers do not foresee it, their enjoyment diminishes over time. Commercial interruptions can disrupt this adaptation process and restore the intensity of consumers\u2019 enjoyment. Six studies demonstrate that, although people preferred to avoid commercial interruptions, these interruptions actually made programs more enjoyable (study 1), regardless of the quality of the commercial (study 2), even when controlling for the mere presence of the ads (study 3), and regardless of the nature of the interruption (study 4). However, this effect was eliminated for people who are less likely to adapt (study 5) and for programs that do not lead to adaptation (study 6), confirming the disruption of adaptation account and identifying crucial boundaries of the effect.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/160/1942726","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer preferences and the effects of commercial interruptions on television enjoyment, with no mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","36","2","Leonard Lee\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Leonard Lee\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    On Amir\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    On Amir\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Dan Ariely\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Dan Ariely\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        *Leonard Lee is assistant professor of marketing, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris 508, New York, NY 10027 (leonardlee@columbia.edu).

In five experiments, participants made a set of binary product choices under conditions designed to induce different degrees of emotional decision processing. The results consistently indicate that greater reliance on emotional reactions during decision making is associated with greater preference consistency and less cognitive noise. Additionally, the results of a meta-analytical study based on data from all five experiments further show that products that elicit a stronger emotional response are more likely to yield consistent preferences.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/173/1942735","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['emotion', 'preferences', 'decision making']","The article focuses primarily on cognitive processes and emotional influences in consumer behavior, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We test this experience recommendation and show that it may be misleading in its general form. Valence of the outcome significantly moderates differences in respondents\u2019 reported retrospective happiness with material versus experiential purchases. For purchases that turned out positively, experiential purchases lead to more happiness than do material purchases, as the experience recommendation suggests. However, for purchases that turned out negatively, experiences have no benefit over (and, for some types of consumers, induce significantly less happiness than) material possessions. We provide evidence that this purchase type by valence interaction is driven by the fact that consumers adapt more slowly to experiential purchases than to material purchases, leading to both greater happiness and greater unhappiness for experiential purchases.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/188/1942750","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior regarding experiential versus material purchases without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In line with predictions, four experiments showed that women\u2019s spontaneous dislike of sexual ads softened when the ad could be interpreted in terms of commitment-related resources being offered by men to women. In contrast, men\u2019s positive attitudes toward sexual ads were relatively unaffected by the salience of relationship commitment cues. These results not only offer insights into consumer reactions to sexual advertising but also inform theories on how men and women conceptualize sexual behaviors and relationships.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/215/1942786","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['gender', 'relationships', 'attitudes', 'commitment']","The article discusses gender differences in attitudes towards sexual advertising, touching on themes of gender and relationship commitment.

If consumers believe that emotion is fleeting, those feeling happy (vs. unhappy) engage in affect regulation because they infer that they need to take actions to maintain their positive feelings. In contrast, if consumers believe that emotion is lasting, those feeling unhappy (vs. happy) engage in affect regulation because they infer that the negative feelings will persist unless they take actions to repair them. These effects are obtained with measured and with manipulated beliefs, and they occur only when the theories pertain specifically to emotion.

While prior research on older consumers focuses on corporeal and cognitive decline and its impact on individual decisionmaking situations, our attention is drawn to the competency and growth potential of those who have exited their formal productive stage and privilege consumption as a means to create and enact identity. Contrary to the received view of older consumers simply reviewing and integrating their already developed identities, we find retirement can be a time of extensive identity work with multiple revived and emergent inspirations weaving across all time orientations (past, present, and future) and involving intricate consumption enactments.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/255/1942851","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identity', 'consumption', 'cultural scripts', 'growth potential']","The article explores the concept of 'identity-inspired consumption' and the cultural dynamics surrounding retirement, indicating a moderate focus on social themes.

Because time increases focus on product experience, activating time (vs. money) augments one\u2019s personal connection with the product, thereby boosting attitudes and decisions. However, because money increases the focus on product possession, the reverse effect can occur in cases where merely owning the product reflects the self (i.e., for prestige possessions or for highly materialistic consumers).

We further demonstrate that these contrasting effects of culture are sensitive to pertinent contextual factors such as the presence of other consumers or a fate-suggestive brand name.

We propose that cognitive busyness and need for closure have distinct roots and can have different effects. We examine their distinction in the context of cultural differences in the two types of socially desirable responding\u2014impression management and self-deceptive enhancement. Our findings indicate that high (vs. low) cognitive busyness weakens the relationship between culture and impression management, but not that between culture and self-deceptive enhancement. In contrast, high (vs. low) need for closure strengthens both relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of these findings.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/305/1942900","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['cultural differences', 'socially desirable responding', 'impression management']","The article discusses cultural differences and their impact on socially desirable responding, which touches on themes of cultural sensitivity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Results in this article replicate those findings in pretrial judgments but show that such biasing cues can improve quality judgments at a later point in time. Initially biasing cues can even yield more accurate judgments than cues that do not bias pretrial judgments and can help consumers after a delay (e.g., at the time of repeat purchase) to determine how much they had liked a product when they tried it before. These results suggest that trying to deceive consumers with the use of biasing cues may induce trial in the short term but may come back to haunt the deceiver at the time of repeat purchase.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/2/317/1942914","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['biasing cues', 'deceive', 'consumer judgments']","The article discusses biasing cues in consumer judgments but does not engage with themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

We extend this work by investigating the impact of changes in price endings and associated leftmost price digits on choice. Findings indicate that assigning different combinations of price endings to two products (e.g., $2.00 and $2.99 vs. $1.99 and $3.00 vs. $2.00 and $3.00) can shift choice share toward the lower- or higher-priced alternative. We also find that changes between just-below (e.g., $29.99 and $39.99) and round (e.g., $30.00 and $40.00) pricing affect choice, with just-below pricing shifting share toward lower-priced alternatives. The latter effects are found to be moderated by price level and shopping goals.

However, a common piece of advice given to consumers who have to make complex decisions is to distract their attention away from the decision problem for some moments. The current research shows that distraction can indeed help consumers to differentiate attractive from unattractive products. Yet this occurs only for consumers with a configural mind-set who tend to form coherent representations of products in their memory. For consumers with a featural mind-set, who typically hold mixed product representations, distraction does not affect product evaluations.

The influence of the healthy item on indulgent choice is stronger for those with higher levels of self-control.

Contrary to most other self-regulatory situations, however, consecutive self-regulatory decisions in consumer settings tend to be similar in the control processes that they recruit. Three experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of similarity. When two consecutive self-regulatory situations require similar control processes (e.g., restraining food intake), initial engagement in self-regulation enhances subsequent self-regulation. Our data thus challenge the self-regulatory strength model of (consumer) self-regulatory decision making but are consistent with cognitive control theory.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/394/1846968","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive control and self-regulation in consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Two studies show that people provide larger quantity estimates when shown random patterns of identical colored dots or geometric shapes than when those patterns contain variety. The difference in perceived quantity does not grow as the number of different types increases beyond two, and it disappears if the overall area occupied by the set is made salient through context. We attribute the results to the natural consolidation of identical items into a single Gestalt whole that makes the set seem larger. Two additional studies show that this perceptual influence also causes people to pour more when using varied items to match a sample of food.

However, little is known about when exactly such priming leads to goal activation, which can have enduring behavioral effects, and when the same prime leads to semantic activation, characterized by short-lived effects. This research proposes an activation-striving model, which proposes that behavioral effects of primes are moderated by discrepancies between the prime and the self-concept. Three studies suggest that self-consistent primes are more likely to influence choice via semantic activation, whereas self-discrepant primes are more likely to influence choice via goal activation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/418/1846999","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and the psychological mechanisms of priming without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Construal Levels and Depletion Effects in the Processing of Health Messages","The depletion effect occurs when individuals who exert self-control in a previous task (i.e., depleted individuals) exhibit less self-control on a subsequent task relative to individuals who did not previously exert self-control. This article presents two experiments that implicate construal levels to understand the processes underlying depletion effects in the context of consumer health. At low-level construals, individuals rely on resource accessibility cues (e.g., feelings of tiredness) to determine self-control. Hence, they exert less self-control only when they assess themselves as depleted, manifesting the depletion effect. High-level construals reduce the resource focus and enhance a goal focus, which diminishes and even reverses the depletion effect.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/448/1847009","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-control', 'consumer health', 'depletion effect']","The article primarily focuses on psychological concepts related to self-control and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Further, when initial category-based elimination is enforced, the asymmetric dominance effect and the tendency to prefer a middle option are both mitigated.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/463/1847018","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of choice context effects without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These uses emerged from findings that Chinese form meanings of Western brands, drawing from select historical national narratives of East-West relations: the West as liberator and Western brands as instruments of democratization; the West as oppressor and Western brands as instruments of domination; the West as subjugated and Western brands, by their own subjugation, as symbolically erasing China's past humiliations; and the West as partner and Western brands as instruments of economic progress. Our emergent theory elaborates processes by which Western brands are shaped by macrolevel, sociohistorical forces to motivate consumers' responses to them as political action tied to nation making.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/504/2900263","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['national identity', 'democratization', 'political action', 'sociohistorical forces']","The article discusses how Western brands are utilized by Chinese consumers to express national identity, which touches on themes of cultural representation and political action.

The results show that consumers with an accessible global identity prefer a global (more than a local) product and consumers with an accessible local identity prefer a local (more than a global) product. Of note, this effect was reversed, either by an explicit instruction about accessible identities being nondiagnostic (study 1) or implicitly by inducing a differentiative (vs. integrative) processing mode (study 2).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/3/524/1847050","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identities', 'global', 'local', 'evaluation', 'consumer']","The article explores how consumer identities influence product evaluation, touching on themes of local versus global preferences, which can relate to cultural sensitivity and diversity in consumer behavior.

Sensitivity to such cues varies with chronic dispositional differences in spending attitudes.

In a pilot study and two experiments spanning three distinct classes of stimuli, we find that people can recover from this satiation by simply recalling the variety of alternative items they have consumed in the past. And yet, people seem to exhibit \u201cvariety amnesia\u201d in that they do not spontaneously recall this past variety despite the fact that it would result in a desirable decrease in satiation. Thus, rather than satiation being a fixed physiological process, it appears that it is at least partially constructed in the moment. We discuss some of the theoretical implications of these findings and provide some prescriptive measures for both marketers and consumers.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/4/575/1788277","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

Building on reactance theory and the environmental psychology literature, we propose that spatially confined consumers react against an incursion to their personal space by making more varied and unique choices. We present four laboratory experiments and one field study to support our theorizing. Study 1 demonstrates that people in narrower aisles seek more variety than people in wider aisles. Study 2 indicates that this effect of confinement in narrow aisles also extends to more unique choices. Study 3 shows that perceptions of confinement exert their strongest influence on people who are chronically high in reactance. Study 4 suggests that influencing perceptions of confinement is sufficient to evoke variety seeking. Finally, the field study uses crowding as a proxy for confinement and finds a positive relationship between crowding and variety seeking in real grocery purchases.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/4/600/1788854","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['freedom', 'variety', 'confinement']","The article focuses on consumer behavior in response to spatial confinement, which does not directly engage with social justice or equity themes.

Participants received information about a product that had implications for both desirability and the feasibility of using it, while anticipating either its immediate or future use. They were later asked to reevaluate the product for use at either the same or a different point in time. Participants who reevaluated the product for future use based their judgments on desirability considerations regardless of when they had considered using it initially.

However, a \u201cfreebie\u201d offer did not influence the overall price for the bundle of disparate products, a finding robust across two different settings and populations. The differential effect of freebies is explained by varying judgment difficulty, with the price being easier to arrive at for just a single product than for the combination. Consistent with this explanation, factors that influence judgment difficulty (the salience of the company\u2019s motive for offering the freebie and time pressure to make a judgment) moderated the effects of a free offer on the amount consumers were willing to pay.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/4/660/1789723","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In two of the three field studies, individuals spent more once the decision to spend had been made. Study 2 then shows that consumers deliberately choose to receive money in a large denomination relative to small denominations when there is a need to exert self-control in spending. Study 3 further shows that the denomination effect is contingent on individual differences in people\u2019s desire to reduce the pain of paying associated with spending. The results suggest that the denomination effect occurs because large denominations are psychologically less fungible than smaller ones, allowing them to be used as a strategic device to control and regulate spending.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/4/701/1791668","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to spending and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The findings indicate that promotion-focused individuals are more likely to construe information at abstract, high levels, whereas those with a prevention focus are more likely to construe information at concrete, low levels (experiments 1 and 2). Further, such fit (vs. nonfit) between an individual\u2019s regulatory focus and the construal level at which information is represented leads to more favorable attitudes (experiments 3 and 4) and enhances performance on a subsequent task (experiment 3). These outcomes occur because fit enhances engagement that in turn induces processing fluency and intensifies reactions.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/5/735/1788644","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['persuasive', 'consumer goals', 'message concreteness']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we show that multisensory ads result in higher taste perceptions than ads focusing on taste alone, with this result being mediated by the excess of positive over negative sensory thoughts. Since the ad effect is thoughts-driven or cognitive, restricting cognitive resources (imposing cognitive load) attenuates the enhancing effect of the multiple-sense ad. Our results are exhibited across three experiments and have many implications for cognition and sensory perception research within consumer behavior, as well as several practical implications.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/5/748/1788813","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and consumer perception without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, by early adolescence, as stereotypes become stronger, constellations become smaller and less flexible. Although seventh graders use more products and brands to form constellations than younger children, they do so in place of other ways to define roles, such as personality traits, therefore forming constellations with fewer elements overall. By late adolescence, individuals develop more flexible constellations with a greater number of elements.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/5/757/1788932","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['consumption', 'stereotypes', 'brands']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and brand usage among children without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

We show that an incidental similarity, such as a shared birthday or birthplace, can result in a more favorable attitude and a higher intention to purchase. We argue and find that the need for connectedness underlies its persuasive effects in an interpersonal context. In addition, we show that the valence of the salesperson's behavior and the possibility of an extended service relationship moderate the process. When the need for connectedness is mitigated, the positive effects of incidental similarity can be lost or even reversed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/5/778/2877610","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['similarity', 'connectedness', 'attitudes']","The article focuses on the effects of incidental similarity in a sales context, primarily discussing interpersonal dynamics and purchase intentions without addressing broader social justice themes or ethical critiques.

How Comparisons with Others Influence Consumers\u2019 Evaluations of Their Self-Designed Products","The vast majority of consumer behavior research has examined how consumers respond to products that are offered on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis by the manufacturer. Self-design changes the rules substantially, allowing consumers to have much more control over the product\u2019s characteristics. This research examines the factors influencing consumers\u2019 evaluations of self-designed products. Three studies demonstrate that a superior fit between consumers\u2019 underlying preferences and their customized products cannot fully explain self-design evaluations. Comparisons with designers of comparable products can significantly influence evaluations as well. The first two experiments examine how social comparisons with the designers of similar \u201coff-the-rack\u201d products influence evaluations, identifying two key moderators useful in overcoming the negative effects of an upward comparison. A third study uses a real online design task to gain understanding of how the timing of the social comparison moderates the direction of the comparison (upward vs. equivalent) to influence evaluations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/5/806/1789510","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['consumer behavior', 'self-designed', 'social comparisons']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and product evaluations without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This article advances the view that in the United States, support groups that are organized around issues of overconsumption, such as Weight Watchers, resonate with members\u2019 quest for well-being in light of the spiritual-therapeutic model.

When the target is a novel one, perceptions assimilate to the context, whereas when it is highly familiar, perceptions are immune to the influence of context. This is as predicted by the interpretation-comparison model. Contrary to this model, however, we find that effects on perceptions are not always assimilative in nature. When product ambiguity falls between the extremes of novel and highly familiar, a contrast effect in perception can occur.

Consequently, little research has investigated the multifaceted forms of identity work that consumers can undertake through more diverse ideological forms of consumer moralism. To redress this theoretical gap, we analyze the adversarial consumer narratives through which a brand-mediated moral conflict is enacted. We show that consumers\u2019 moralistic identity work is culturally framed by the myth of the moral protagonist and further illuminate how consumers use this mythic structure to transform their ideological beliefs into dramatic narratives of identity. Our resulting theoretical framework explicates identity-value\u2013enhancing relationships among mythic structure, ideological meanings, and marketplace resources that have not been recognized by prior studies of consumer identity work.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/6/1016/1859392","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['moralism', 'identity work', 'ideological beliefs', 'cultural framing', 'moral protagonist']","The article explores the concept of consumer moralism and identity work, emphasizing the cultural and ideological dimensions of consumer behavior.

Individual disengagement diverts inquiry and disrupts inquiry-action linkages, creating lapses that degenerate learning.

We find that people choose a larger portion following another consumer who first selects a large quantity but that this portion is significantly smaller if the other is obese than if she is thin. We also find that the adjustment is more pronounced for consumers who are low in appearance self-esteem and that it is attenuated under cognitive load.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/6/915/1862922","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['body type', 'food choices', 'appearance self-esteem']","The article touches on social influences related to body type and self-esteem, indicating a moderate engagement with themes of body image and societal perceptions.

This lay theory holds that familiar goods are attractive as a respite from dynamic environments and reflects a naive prediction that familiar favorites ameliorate the cognitive or emotional load associated with change. Conversely, the research in this article finds that consumers are more rather than less likely to choose novel options during times of upheaval and suggests that this paradox may occur because of the discrepancy between consumers\u2019 strategic lay theories and more automatic mind-set influences. Five studies demonstrate (1) that the comfort food fallacy effect occurs for both food and nonfood choices (despite consumer predictions to the contrary), (2) that increasing consumers\u2019 perception of life change decreases choice of familiar favorites, and (3) that the effect disappears with high involvement. Understanding this paradox of comfort consumption may help both consumers and marketers promote positive change and innovation adoption.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/6/950/1863412","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['change', 'preferences', 'innovation']","The article discusses consumer behavior in the context of change and innovation, but it does not explicitly address social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose that consumers sample the local maxima and minima of a graph to infer the variation around a trend line, which is used to estimate risk. The local maxima and minima are more extreme the higher the run length of the stocks (the consecutive number of upward or downward movements of a price series with identical mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis). Three experiments show that this leads to stocks with higher run lengths being perceived as riskier: the run-length effect. Importantly, the run-length effect is greater for investors who are more educated, are employed full time, trade more frequently, have had longer experience trading, and trade a wider range of financial instruments. Implications for the communication of financial products, public policy, and consumer welfare are discussed, as are theoretical implications for the processing of visual and financial information and behavioral finance.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/6/964/1863524","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['consumer welfare', 'public policy', 'financial products']","The article touches on consumer welfare and public policy, which indicate some awareness of social implications, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial information processing without a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes."],["2010","36","6","Hakkyun Kim\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Hakkyun Kim\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Kiwan Park\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Kiwan Park\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Norbert Schwarz\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Norbert Schwarz\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        Hakkyun Kim is assistant professor of marketing, John Molson School of Business, Concordia University, Montreal, QC H3G 1M8, Canada (hkim@jmsb.concordia.ca).

The Role of Incidental Emotions in Product Evaluation","Two studies examine how different emotions of the same valence influence product evaluation when products make specific emotional claims. Vacation products with adventurous (serene) appeals were evaluated more favorably when participants felt excited (peaceful) rather than peaceful (excited). This emotion-congruency effect was not observed when participants were aware of the incidental nature of their feelings (study 1) and was mediated by the influence of feelings on participants\u2019 expectations that the product will deliver what it promises (study 2).

Lay Beliefs versus Actual Effects","In a series of studies we examine how incidental mood present at the time of an experience affects judgments made long after the mood has dissipated and compare this to lay beliefs about how mood affects memory-based judgments. We find that memory-based judgments are affected by incidental mood only when there is an external prompt to evaluate the stimulus in real time. This is contrasted with lay beliefs about the effects of mood, which are not sensitive to delay or to the presence of real-time evaluations. The mismatch between lay beliefs and actual effects leads consumers to distort previously unbiased memory-based judgments when they are reminded of the source of the incidental mood.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/36/6/992/1864134","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the psychological effects of incidental mood on consumer judgments without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2010","65","1","JOEL PERESS,\u00a0\n                     JOEL PERESS\n                     Joel Peress is with INSEAD, Department of Finance.

Do product market imperfections spread to equity markets? We examine these questions in a noisy rational expectations model in which firms operate under monopolistic competition while their shares trade in perfectly competitive markets.

In competitive industries, we find that high industry-level stock market valuation, investment, and financing are followed by sharply lower operating cash flows and abnormal stock returns.

Investors have preferences with external habits. Countercyclical risk premia and procyclical real interest rates arise endogenously. During bad times at home, when domestic consumption is close to the habit level, the representative investor is very risk averse. When the domestic investor is more risk averse than her foreign counterpart, the exchange rate is closely tied to domestic consumption growth shocks. The domestic investor therefore expects a positive currency excess return. Because interest rates are low in bad times, expected currency excess returns increase with interest rate differentials.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01525.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model related to exchange rate risk and investor behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2010","65","1","JOS\u00c9 M.

Using 11 years of NYSE specialist inventory positions and trading revenues, we find that aggregate market-level and specialist firm-level spreads widen when specialists have large positions or lose money. The effects are nonlinear and most prominent when inventories are big or trading results have been particularly poor. These sensitivities are smaller after specialist firm mergers, consistent with deep pockets easing financing constraints. Finally, compared to low volatility stocks, the liquidity of high volatility stocks is more sensitive to inventories and losses.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01530.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market liquidity and financial variables without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2010","65","1","KRISTOPHER S.

In the presence of financial market imperfections, leverage and investment are generally correlated so that highly levered firms are also mature firms with relatively more (safe) book assets and fewer (risky) growth opportunities.

A rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers' reporting behavior. When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves communication because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01553.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of loan officer behavior and communication within a bank, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

More densely networked markets experience less entry, with a one-standard deviation increase in network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately one-third. Entrants with established ties to target-market incumbents appear able to overcome this barrier to entry; in turn, incumbents react strategically to an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate entry into their market. Incumbents appear to benefit from reduced entry by paying lower prices for their deals.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01554.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of venture capital networks and their impact on market entry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The firm's optimal capital structure therefore depends on the trade-off between these human costs and the tax benefits of debt. Optimal debt levels consistent with those observed in practice emerge without relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information. Consistent with empirical evidence, persistent idiosyncratic differences in leverage across firms also result.

Lower cross-divisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between investment opportunity and cash flow correspond to lower cash holdings, even after controlling for cash flow volatility.

We study the political economy of state usury laws in 19th century America. Exploiting the wide variation in regulation, enforcement, and economic conditions across states and time, we find that usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity, especially for smaller firms. We examine the motives of regulation and find that usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring wealthy political incumbents, particularly when they have more voting power. The evidence suggests financial regulation is driven by private interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests protecting the underserved.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01560.x","articles","JF","Finance","4","['regulation', 'public interests', 'underserved', 'private interests', 'wealthy']","The article discusses the motives behind financial regulation and highlights the impact on the underserved, suggesting a critique of economic policies favoring wealthy incumbents.

Subsidiary-based corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross-country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, a bank's corporate structure affects its risk taking and affiliate size.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01561.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management and corporate structures in banking without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice."],["2010","65","3","LAURENT FRESARD,\u00a0\n                     LAURENT FRESARD\n                     Laurent Fr\u00e9sard is from HEC Paris.

The pattern of price responses to supply or demand shocks typically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a subsequent and more extended reversal. The amplitude of the immediate price impact and the pattern of the subsequent recovery can reflect institutional impediments to immediate trade, such as search costs for trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries. I discuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent financial crisis that caused asset price distortions, which subsided afterward. After presenting examples of price reactions to supply shocks in normal market settings, I offer a simple illustrative model of price dynamics associated with slow-moving capital due to the presence of inattentive investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01569.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset price dynamics and investment capital without addressing any social justice themes, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We show in an endowment economy that recursive utility with GDA risk preferences generates effective risk aversion that is countercyclical.

The variation in effective risk aversion produces a large equity premium and a risk-free rate that is procyclical and has low volatility in an economy with a simple autoregressive endowment-growth process.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01571.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk preferences and asset pricing without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2010","65","4","HENGJIE AI,\u00a0\n                     HENGJIE AI\n                     Hengjie Ai is at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University.

From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and improved bank performance. Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median.

To fit the observed forced turnover rate, the model needs the average board of directors to behave as if replacing the CEO costs shareholders at least $200 million. This cost mainly reflects CEO entrenchment rather than a real cost to shareholders.

By integrating the area between the benefit and cost functions, we estimate that the equilibrium net benefit of debt is 3.5% of asset value, resulting from an estimated gross benefit (cost) of debt equal to 10.4% (6.9%) of asset value. We find that the cost of being overlevered is asymmetrically higher than the cost of being underlevered and that expected default costs constitute only half of the total ex ante costs of debt.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01611.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of finance related to the cost of debt without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

The median firm captures net benefits of up to 5.5% of firm value. Small and profitable firms have high optimal leverage ratios, as predicted by theory, but in contrast to existing empirical evidence. Companies are on average slightly underlevered relative to the optimal leverage ratio at refinancing. This result is mainly due to zero leverage firms.

Countercyclical fluctuations in risk prices, default probabilities, and default losses arise endogenously through firms' responses to macroeconomic conditions. These comovements generate large credit risk premia for investment grade firms, which helps address the credit spread puzzle and the under-leverage puzzle in a unified framework. The model generates interesting dynamics for financing and defaults, including market timing in debt issuance and credit contagion. It also provides a novel procedure to estimate state-dependent default losses.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01613.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically capital structure and credit spreads, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that fraud detection does not rely on standard corporate governance actors (investors, SEC, and auditors), but rather takes a village, including several nontraditional players (employees, media, and industry regulators). Differences in access to information, as well as monetary and reputational incentives, help to explain this pattern. In-depth analyses suggest that reputational incentives in general are weak, except for journalists in large cases.

More constrained firms engage in less risk management and may exhaust their debt capacity and abstain from risk management, consistent with empirical evidence and in contrast to received theory.

A legacy makes CEO replacement expensive, because firm performance can only partially be attributed to a newly employed manager. Boards may therefore optimally allow an incumbent to be entrenched. Moreover, when a firm changes strategy it is optimal to change the CEO, because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail. Even though CEOs have no specific skills in our model, legacy issues can explain the empirical association between CEO and strategy change.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01619.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on CEO compensation and strategic decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Third, we find large variation in our risk measure across jump models, indicative of model risk. Fourth, among the jump models we consider, the finite-moment log-stable model provides the most conservative risk estimates. Fifth, imposing more stringent VaR levels accentuates the impact of intra-horizon risk in jump models. Finally, using an alternative benchmark VaR does not dilute the role of intra-horizon risk.

However, this argument ignores potential non-tax costs that can accompany tax aggressiveness, especially those arising from agency problems. Firms owned/run by founding family members are characterized by a unique agency conflict between dominant and small shareholders. Using multiple measures to capture tax aggressiveness and founding family presence, we find that family firms are less tax aggressive than their non-family counterparts, ceteris paribus. This result suggests that family owners are willing to forgo tax benefits to avoid the non-tax cost of a potential price discount, which can arise from minority shareholders\u2019 concern with family rent-seeking masked by tax avoidance activities [Desai and Dharmapala, 2006.

Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect short-selling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near downgrades. Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict downgrades on the basis of public information about firms\u2019 financial health.

Empirical results are consistent with this explanation. The return premiums to low leverage and low distress are significant in raw returns, and even stronger in risk-adjusted returns. When in distress, low-leverage firms suffer more than high-leverage firms as measured by a deterioration in accounting operating performance and heightened exposure to systematic risk.

Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility.

One strategy is to complete the acquisition sequentially rather than as a one-time deal. In contrast to firms in developed economies that enjoy relatively easy access to information, emerging-market firms face differential access to information on target firms, owing to institutional weaknesses and constraints in those markets. Sequential acquisitions are conceptualized as a real-option-based strategy, whereby the sequential acquirer resolves valuation uncertainty through information gathering and learning after making a toehold purchase. The value of a sequential acquisition strategy increases for firms that are at an information disadvantage. Statistical analysis, based on 272 completed acquisitions of Chinese listed firms between 1995 and 2003, shows that the sequential method is more likely to be chosen over a single-transaction mode when the acquirer is a private firm, or when the acquirer is diversifying into a new business area.

We conjecture that when countries give outsiders more influence, IPO issuers underprice more to generate excess demand for the offer, which in turn leads to greater ownership dispersion and reduces outsiders\u2019 incentives to monitor the behavior of corporate insiders. In other words, underpricing is a cost that insiders pay to maintain control in countries with legal systems designed to empower outsiders. Consistent with this control motivation for underpricing, we find that underpricing has a negative association with post-IPO outside blockholdings and a positive association with private control benefits. In addition, firms whose insiders are entrenched either by majority ownership or by dual-class structures do not underprice more in countries with better governance. In these firms the ownership structure protects managers from outside influence, eliminating the incentive to increase outside ownership dispersion through underpricing.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2009.38","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['governance', 'investors', 'insiders']","The article discusses corporate governance and its effects on IPO underpricing, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of finance rather than social justice or equity themes.

Our paper addresses this gap in the literature by examining how the competitive strategies of SMEs evolve during institutional transitions, and assessing the implications for firm growth. Using data collected from 135 SMEs in 1993, and 200 SMEs in 2001, we find that managerial networking intensity (i.e., developing and maintaining relationships that may be used for business purposes) declines markedly over time, whereas the importance of market-based strategies increases. Managerial networking intensity is strongly associated with firm growth early in the institutional transition process, but not later. Market-based strategies are not associated with firm growth in either time period. Drawing on convergent insights from multiple theoretical perspectives, we argue that changes in strategy are concurrently driven by socially constructed norms that legitimize new ways of competing and delegitimize old ones, and by knowledge acquisition and learning, which provide managers with a more diverse set of tools with which to exercise their strategic choices.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2009.45","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional upheaval', 'socially constructed norms', 'firm growth']","The article discusses the impact of institutional upheaval and socially constructed norms on business strategies, indicating some awareness of social dynamics.

Insights from organizational ecology are used to explain how institutional forces constrain ecological processes, together driving the evolution of the population size of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), privately held domestic firms, and state-owned domestic organizations. We argue that the variation in the relative forces of ecological processes and institutional constraints across FIEs and their domestic rivals accounts for the expansion of FIEs in China. On the one hand, in many transition economies, institutional constraints are imposed on foreign enterprises by regulation that limits FDI opportunities. On the other hand, after entry, foreign enterprises can benefit from their competitive advantages in their ecological struggle against domestic rivals. This logic produces different sets of hypotheses as to foreign enterprises\u2019 density and sales growth, in interaction with domestic organizations.

We find that, before the crisis, family control is unrelated to firms' equity financing costs, whereas, following the crisis, family control is related to a higher cost of equity. This suggests that the crisis made investors aware of the potential entrenchment of controlling families, prompting them to require a higher-equity premium from family firms. Our results are robust to various models of the cost of equity capital, additional firm- and country-level governance traits, and additional alternative explanations, including the presence of other types of large shareholders and potential survivorship bias.

Hypotheses are empirically tested through two studies, one based on large US manufacturing firms and the other on a cross-national sample of medium-sized firms actively involved in international technology licensing. Results from both studies show a greater propensity to use non-exclusive/multiple licensing when the licensed technology has greater potential to produce differentiated products, or when there is greater threat of substitutive technologies entering the market.

The empirical model of the probability of observing a product innovation, a probit model, by a firm considers three levels of analysis: firm characteristics, industry characteristics, and the national context. The econometric evidence supports the global engagement and information spillovers hypotheses, but the evidence on the role of market structure is mixed. Regarding global engagement, the evidence suggests that product innovation by incumbent firms is positively correlated with the act of investing in R&D and licensing of foreign technologies, and country-level average import tariffs reduce the probability of product innovation. Regarding information spillovers, the evidence also shows that a country's patent density is positively correlated with product innovation.

With this conceptual framework developed, we explored our empirical goal, a test of the model using both societal-level and individual-level indicators. First, we pan-culturally tested the model across our seven-society sample. Next, we split these societies into high and low gross national income categories. Likewise, we split the respondents in our sample, regardless of their country, into high and low idiocentrism/individualism and allocentrism/collectivism categories and tested at these group levels. Our findings showed that personal resources \u2013 mastery, optimistic orientation, and self-esteem \u2013 generally served to buffer the experienced strain due to work role ambiguity and conflict. This study provides specific information that can assist the global business community in understanding how stress pervades their workforces. Overall, our findings offer substantial evidence that a global model of stress is truly viable, providing direction for future research on stress in the global workforce.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2009.68","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","4","['stressors', 'resources', 'global', 'workforce']","The article addresses psychological resources and their impact on stressors in a global context, which touches on themes of well-being and workforce dynamics.

To reconcile conflicting perspectives and past results, we propose that cultural diversity affects teams through process losses and gains associated with increased divergence and decreased convergence. We examine whether the level (surface-level vs deep-level) and type (cross-national vs intra-national) of cultural diversity affect these processes differently. We hypothesize that task complexity and structural aspects of the team, such as team size, team tenure, and team dispersion, moderate the effects of cultural diversity on teams.

We link historical changes in the character of MNE activities to changes in the institutional environment, and highlight the scope for firm-level creativity and institutional entrepreneurship that may lead to co-evolution with the environment. We argue that the main drivers for institutional entrepreneurship are now found in the increasing autonomy of MNE subsidiaries. Thus MNE agency derives from more decentralized forms of experimentation in international corporate networks, which competence-creating nodes of new initiatives can co-evolve with local institutions. Unlike most other streams of related literature, our approach connects patterns of institutional change in wider business systems with more micro processes of variety generation and experimentation within and across individual firms.

The proposed framework expands the interpartner learning theory of IJV instability in the current literature, which is focused on absorptive learning of IJV partners, by incorporating IJV partners\u2019 joint learning. Using longitudinal dyadic data from IJVs in China, we found that local and foreign IJV parties\u2019 absorptive learning capacity decreases one party's dependence on the other, while joint learning capacity in IJV increases both parties\u2019 dependence on each other. In addition, an IJV partner's absorptive learning capacity positively moderates the effect of joint learning capacity on its dependence on another partner. These findings lend support to the expanded interpartner learning perspective of IJV instability, and have important theoretical and managerial implications for IJVs in emerging economies. The results underscore the importance of the IJV actively developing organizational rules, procedures, and structures to create and embed new knowledge in order to maintain the stability of the IJV.

This paper argues that if the research design does not address the issue of causality, a positive relationship cannot necessarily be interpreted as meaning that DOI has improved performance. Furthermore, the research design should consider risk exposure. For example, if the riskiness of a firm fell as a result of a move abroad, then one can envision a negative relationship and also conclude that the move abroad paid off. Using detailed quarterly data over the period 1994\u20132004 on the distribution of Canadian banks' assets across countries, and broken down by risk category, the analysis simultaneously accounts for endogeneity and risk exposure. The results establish a causal relationship between DOI and performance, but find that the nature of this relationship varies by bank, and also depends upon the riskiness associated with each bank's foreign asset exposures. These causal relationships are robust to the introduction of two formal risk measures: credit ratings and share price volatility.

The results of 399 buyer\u2013supplier exchanges in China show that: (1) when managers perceive that the legal system can protect their firm's interests, they tend to use explicit contracts rather than relational reliability to safeguard transactions involving risks (i.e., asset specificity, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty); and (2) when managers do not perceive the legal system as credible, they are less likely to use contracts, and instead rely on relational reliability to safeguard transactions associated with specialized assets and environmental uncertainty, but not those involving behavioral uncertainty. We further find that legal enforceability does not moderate the effect of relational reliability on contracts, but does weaken the effect of contracts on relational reliability. These results endorse the importance of prior experience (e.g., relational reliability) in supporting the use of explicit contracts, and alternatively suggest that, under conditions of greater legal enforceability, the contract signals less regarding one's intention to be trustworthy but more about the efficacy of sanctions.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2010.7","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on legal enforceability and contract use in business transactions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Infrastructure assets are susceptible to creeping expropriation from host governments, and to hold-up from concentrated suppliers/buyers. Corporate finance-based foreign direct investment (FDI) cannot fully mitigate these threats. However, PF-based FDI through strategic use of capital structure \u2013 chiefly high leverage and syndicate structure of debt \u2013 improves the bargaining position of firms in ex post recontracting negotiations. High leverage precommits cash flows, serves as a monitoring and early warning mechanism that reveals creeping expropriation, induces lenders to join renegotiations and reduces reported net profits. The syndicate structure of debt creates a reputation effect for host countries. High debt shields wealth from concentrated suppliers/buyers while separate incorporation in PF allows suppliers/buyers to hold equity stakes. This theoretical framework is tested by assembling a database of 200 investments worth $159.97 billion, by 167 firms, in 128 countries over 17 years. Sample selection bias is controlled for through Heckman probit specification.

This general model addresses two major gaps in the literature. First, although market failure is the driving force behind the rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs), most researchers have focused on the failure of a single market without exploring the presence of substitute markets for cross-border transactions. Second, many previous studies have begun their analysis with a bilateral setup between an MNE and an indigenous firm (for example, a licensing agreement), but concluded with a unilateral decision made by the MNE to evade the indigenous firm (in the case of direct investment). In bridging the two literature gaps, I propose a general TCE model to integrate all institutional modes available to firms for governing international business, such as licensing, outsourcing, acquisitions, and joint ventures. Built on a multi-market framework, my analysis reveals that the choice of the optimal international business institution is tantamount to the selection of the most efficient market to conduct cross-border transactions. Drawing on a bilateral setup, it explicitly recognizes the power of reciprocity in solving the problem of market failure. This distinct approach points out promising directions for future researchers to advance international business studies, particularly after my transaction-level analysis has been expanded to also consider institutional contexts and firm capabilities.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2009.93","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['market failure', 'reciprocity', 'international business']","The article primarily focuses on transaction-cost economics and market efficiency without emphasizing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We argue that the strength of these negative relationships varies systematically with the type of foreign activity (horizontal or vertical) and the type of institutional hazard (governance or cultural). Because institutional hazards striking vertical affiliates generally also have negative consequences for other parts of a multinational enterprise (MNE) while those striking horizontal affiliates do not, we hypothesize that institutional hazards are more negatively related to vertical foreign activity than to horizontal foreign activity. Since cultural hazards can generally be reduced or resolved once they materialize while governance hazards cannot, we also hypothesize that the impact of governance hazards on each type of foreign activity is more negative than the impact of cultural hazards on that type of activity. A panel data analysis of sales by US foreign affiliates to affiliated and local unaffiliated customers over the period 1996\u20132004 lends support to these hypotheses.

China was selected as the setting of the study because it is the largest emerging market, has seen double-digit growth of advertising expenditures for the past two decades, and is home to many multinational advertising agencies that have increasingly pursued local clients as revenue sources. Multiple informants from 177 domestic Chinese firms and their multinational advertising agencies were personally interviewed, and the dyadic data were used to test the model.

Conflation of the two is a problem of stated preferences methods in general, regardless of question formats.

Implications are twofold. First, we argue that, in order to measure values, we need to look at alternatives to the stated preferences approach, such as revealed preferences and experienced preferences, of which the latter seems most promising.

We find that, after controlling for other determinants of forecast accuracy, analysts experience greater difficulty in predicting the earnings of firms with political connections than those of firms with no such connections. However, in jurisdictions in which corruption level is relatively high, earnings forecast accuracy is influenced more by a firm's political connections. Our findings contribute to the IB literature by demonstrating that political connections exacerbate the information asymmetry between investors and managers, and also that anti-corruption measures can curb the adverse effect of political connections on the corporate information environment.

We argue that FDI stocks are a biased measure of that activity, because the degree to which they overestimate or underestimate affiliate activity varies systematically with host-country characteristics. First, most FDI into countries that serve as tax havens generate no actual productive activity; thus FDI stocks in such countries overestimate affiliate activity. Second, FDI stocks do not include locally raised external funds, funds widely used in countries with well-developed financial markets or volatile exchange rates, resulting in an underestimation of affiliate activity in such countries. Finally, the extent to which FDI translates into affiliate activity increases with affiliate labor productivity, so in countries where labor is more productive, FDI stocks also result in an underestimation of affiliate activity. We test these hypotheses by first regressing affiliate value-added and affiliate sales on FDI stocks to calculate a country-specific mismatch, and then by regressing this mismatch on a host country's tax haven status, level of financial market development, exchange rate volatility, and affiliate labor productivity. All hypotheses are supported, implying that FDI stocks are a biased measure of MNE affiliate activity, and hence that the results of FDI-data-based studies of such activity need to be reconsidered.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2010.29","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['biased', 'host-country characteristics', 'productive activity']","The article discusses biases in measuring multinational enterprises' activities based on host-country characteristics, indicating a consideration of ethical implications in international business practices.

Since the early 1990s, a large number of studies have sought to understand the causes and consequences of corruption employing firm-level survey data from various countries. While insightful, these analyses have largely ignored two important potential problems: nonresponse and potential false response by the firms. We argue that in politically repressive environments, firms use nonresponse and potential false response as self-protection mechanisms. Corruption is likely understated in such countries. We test our argument using the World Bank enterprise survey data of more than 44,000 firms in 72 countries for the period 2000\u20132005. We find that firms in countries with less press freedom are more likely to provide nonresponse and false response on the issue of corruption. Therefore ignoring these systematic biases in firms\u2019 responses could result in serious underestimation of the severity of corruption in politically repressive countries. More important, these biases are a rich and underutilized source of information on the political constraints faced by the firms.

Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme.

Across program genres, the authors find that dramas have increased program popularity and reduced ad avoidance, whereas reality television experiences increased ad avoidance. The analysis reveals the importance of incorporating show-specific random effects because their omission can result in spurious attribution of differences in ad avoidance and program popularity to genre.

Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded.

Using data collected from 349 pairs of customers and service employees in two national groups (Hong Kong and the United States) of a global financial institution, this study examines how (1) CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of economic and relational values and (2) the effects of CP on value creation depend on participants\u2019 cultural value orientations. Promoting CP could be a double-edged sword for firms: CP enhances customers\u2019 economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between customers and employees, but it also increases employees\u2019 job stress and hampers their job satisfaction.

First, what is the functional form of salespeople's performance trajectories during a period of change implementation? Second, why are some salespeople better at adapting to change than others? Polynomial growth models show that the average salesperson performance trajectory displays an initial decline, gradual recovery, and eventual restabilization. Salesperson learning orientation is related positively to larger initial declines, steeper recovery slopes, and higher restabilization levels. In contrast, performance orientation is related positively to smaller initial declines, but shallower recovery slopes and lower restabilization levels. The results suggest that successful implementation of planned change interventions largely depends on identifying and appreciating the heterogeneity of individual traits that share meaning with the change.

For functional brands, the authors find that holistic thinkers provide more favorable responses to distant extensions than analytic thinkers; however, for prestige brands, holistic and analytic thinkers respond equally favorably. Thus, analytic thinkers are identified as the roadblocks for functional brands launching distant brand extensions. To meet this challenge, the authors offer several strategies, including (1) using a subbrand (Excer wallets by Toyota) instead of a direct brand (Toyota wallets) to reduce analytic thinking; (2) using elaborational communications, which address potentially problematic features of the extension, to reduce analytic thinking; and (3) matching extension information with the consumer's style of thinking, which increases the persuasiveness of ad messages.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.74.3.080","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and brand strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The authors empirically test the theoretical predictions using data from 45 NE markets. They show that these two types of compatibility affect the pioneer's survival advantage in opposite directions and that such directions are reversed when NE changes from extremely strong to extremely weak. Specifically, in markets with strong NE, cross-generation incompatibility harms but within-generation incompatibility favors the pioneer's survival advantage. Consequently, pioneers are likely to enjoy a survival advantage when their product is cross-generation compatible but within-generation incompatible. However, in markets with weak NE, pioneer survival advantage is likely to occur under opposite conditions (i.e., cross-generation incompatible but within-generation compatible). The policy analysis further suggests that the best survival condition for pioneers often turns out to be the worst for followers in these markets.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.74.4.001","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market dynamics and product compatibility without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them.

Data are from the French perfume market, in which some market leaders are decades old while hundreds of new entrants launch yearly. The authors reveal monotonically increasing differences across age ranges.

Nostalgia for options encountered during an early \u201cformative period\u201d has only a limited impact. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity emerges: At all ages, some consumers frequently change their preferred brand, whereas others remain attached to it for long periods. It is the proportion of these two behaviors that varies across age ranges.

For the corporate brand context, the results show that EP effects in one category carry over to adjacent categories that do not have an EP association. Greater multicategory EP prevalence does not enhance brand attractiveness beyond the effect of a single EP exposure. For the house-of-brands context, there is an inverse relationship between brand strength and incremental gain from EP. From a return-on-investment standpoint, EP promotions are more efficient than price promotions because they enhance brand preference and are relatively cheaper to deploy.

By examining salesperson-level variance on new product performance, the authors suggest that managers should focus on increasing salesperson self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward selling the product to build selling intentions and quickly grow new product performance. They also suggest that sales managers should resist the temptation to rely on normative pressure during a new product introduction.

The authors theorize that a wronged firm's payoff from accommodation depends on its approach to monitoring, either employing overt surveillance or relying on its partner's self-control. Overt surveillance is believed to undermine accommodation's ability to convince a selfish partner that cooperation is beneficial and not inconsistent with its self-interest. In contrast, because no or low monitoring is a relational approach to evaluation, it tends to reinforce accommodation, persuading a competitive partner to reciprocate cooperatively. Data collected from 174 international marketing alliances support the authors\u2019 prediction that under low monitoring, accommodation is positively associated with performance in the alliance. Unexpectedly, under high monitoring, performance is greatest under both low and high accommodation. An explanation may lie in accommodation theory's notion that as accommodation increases, a selfish partner transitions from competition to cooperation, ceasing to exploit accommodation and upturning performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.74.6.77","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['cooperation', 'self-serving', 'accommodation']","The article discusses cooperative responses to exploitative behavior in marketing alliances, indicating some awareness of relational dynamics in business.

In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising.

Experiment 2 indicates corresponding effects for intent but shows that adding a directly competitive smoker approval message nullifies this effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects among smokers.

The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation.

For example, in addition to supplying goods and services, a supplier may have a research-and-development alliance and a marketing alliance with a customer. This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The findings from panel data on supplier\u2013customer relationships suggest that an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, among other methodological concerns. These findings have clear implications for managing multiple types of ties with a customer and indicate that relationship multiplexity is a valuable nonfinancial metric.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.36","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['ties', 'relationships', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of supplier-customer relationships and sales performance without significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

As these imitation effects can be time varying, the authors specify their dynamics using a \u201cpolynomial smoother\u201d embedded within the Bayesian framework.

The authors find that regardless of whether the manufacturer offers a trade promotion, allowing the retailer to forward buy and hold inventory for the future can, under certain conditions, be beneficial for both parties. Disallowing forward buying by the retailer may lead the manufacturer to lower merchandising requirements and change the depth of the promotion. In competitive environments, there are situations in which retailers engage in forward buying because of competitive pressures in a prisoner's-dilemma situation.

Three questions are addressed: (1) Does allowing sellers to connect to each other create value (i.e., increase sales)?

The authors analyze purchase behavior among customers who live far from the retail store but must now pay sales taxes on catalog and Internet purchases. A comparable group of customers in a neighboring state serves as a control. The results show that Internet sales decrease significantly, but catalog sales are unaffected. Further investigation indicates that the difference in these outcomes is partly attributable to the ease with which customers can search for lower prices at competing retailers.

As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers\u2019 expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set.

The authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she can decide whether to exercise the option. The authors present a simple analytical model of consumer options in this setting.

Such multimarket contact has been shown to deter aggressive competition, leading to \u201cmutual forbearance.\u201d Empirical support for this phenomenon derives mainly from studies on the direct effects of multimarket contact on a firm's decision variables. The analysis in this article extends the existing literature by empirically considering both the direct effects of multimarket contact (i.e., how it affects a firm's decision variables) and its strategic effects (i.e., how it affects a firm's reactions to its competitors' decision variables). The authors study the pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal computer industry. Consistent with prior research, the authors find that firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions. More important, the authors find strong strategic effects that are asymmetric; namely, firms respond to competitive attacks by introducing new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon. Thus, firms isolate any competitive retaliation to only a single marketing variable. The results offer a deeper understanding of the influence of multimarket contact on firm behavior.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.415","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive strategies and firm behavior in the personal computer industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the console war either with 10% more games or with a \u201chead start\u201d of one million units in installed base at the time of the PlayStation introduction.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.428","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies in the video game market without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A critical challenge in estimating marketing-mix responsiveness from historical data is that the observed decisions were affected by private information possessed by managers about the heterogeneous effects of marketing-mix variables on sales. The authors refer to this as the \u201cslope endogeneity\u201d problem. Such endogeneity differs from the \u201cintercept endogeneity\u201d problem, which has been widely acknowledged in the literature. To correct for the slope endogeneity bias, the authors develop a conceptually simple control function approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and marketing-mix carryover effects. The method is applied to forecasting advertising responsiveness in the U.S. DVD market. The results suggest that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles and that estimated marketing-mix elasticities would be biased if the slope endogeneity problem were ignored.

However, knowledge of such intrahousehold behavioral interaction enables marketers to target their communications more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a modeling framework to capture the intrahousehold behavioral interaction based on family members' actual consumption behavior over time. The authors develop a model to capture multiple agents' (more than two individuals') simultaneous choice decisions over more than two choice alternatives. This is extremely difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members' television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are watching. The proposed model makes it possible to estimate the individual's intrinsic preference and the extrinsic preference from a joint consumption with other members. In turn, these estimates enable the authors to test several alternative group decision-making heuristics that may operate in those joint consumption occasions and to conduct managerially useful counterfactual simulations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.470","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['behavioral interaction', 'family members', 'consumption behavior']","The article primarily focuses on quantitative modeling of household behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors find that when consumers make their own choices, they exhibit increases in evaluations of delayed consumption, but only if the interval between choice and consumption is relatively short. The effect attenuates over longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time. These effects depend on the extent of intrinsic motivation toward the object of consumption and occur only for consummatory consumption that is of inherent interest.

The underlying process for both outcomes is a recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two desirable products).

Initial forays into this area suggest that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is irrelevant when advertisement arguments are strong or consumers are highly motivated to process. In contrast to these conclusions, the authors contend that depletion has important but previously hidden effects in such contexts. That is, although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty.

However, high uniqueness does not decrease willingness to generate WOM for privately consumed products (Study 1).

Along with this premise, however, the literature reveals a growing recognition that the manner in which important customer-based outcomes are constructed in the short term has vital implications for long-term firm performance. Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997\u20132005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70% in going from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time, increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the volatility in shareholder value.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.612","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['customer satisfaction', 'shareholder value', 'diverse sources']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between customer satisfaction and shareholder value without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

First, do biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall, exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme allocations.

Because the influence of potentially hundreds of friends needs to be evaluated for each user, inferring precisely who is influential\u2014and, therefore, of managerial interest for advertising targeting and retention efforts\u2014is difficult. The authors develop an approach to determine which users have significant effects on the activities of others using the longitudinal records of members' log-in activity.

The approach identifies the specific users who most influence others' activity and does so considerably better than simpler alternatives.

Consumers previously exposed to broad assortments or categorizations base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those made salient by the environment.

Vector autoregressive modeling of the metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for almost one-third of explained sales variance. Competitive and own mind-set metrics make a similar contribution. Wear-in times reveal that mind-set metrics can be used as advance warning signals that allow enough time for managerial action before market performance itself is affected.

Therefore, self-explicated approaches are still frequently used because of their simple design, which facilitates preference elicitation when large numbers of attributes need to be considered. However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using complex, high-involvement products.

A third alternative, generalized structured component analysis, was introduced recently in the psychometric literature. The authors conduct a simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of these three approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification. In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.699","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of structural equation modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This research examines the effect of decision order on purchase quantity decisions. The authors build on prior work on decision difficulty and conflict to show that consumers choose more overall, and more variety, when they consider a less replaceable attribute in an earlier, rather than a later, stage in the purchase decision. For example, consumers choose a greater quantity when flavor (or brand) decisions precede, rather than follow, size decisions. The authors find that the degree of attribute replaceability also moderates the effect of decision order on quantity chosen. Furthermore, marketers can influence the amount chosen by altering the organization of the shelf display.

This intriguing retailing format appears in an increasing number of large department stores worldwide. The authors use a theoretical model to investigate the economic incentives a retailer faces when deciding on this arrangement. The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space. An extension of the model to the case of competing retailers shows that the store-within-a-store arrangement can moderate interstore competition.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.748","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of retail arrangements without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.764","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['control systems', 'sales performance', 'customer perceptions']","The article focuses primarily on sales performance and control systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong.

Using brand choice models that accommodate context (compromise, similarity, and attraction) effects, the authors find that both economy and premium PLs cannibalize incumbent PLs. Economy PL introductions benefit mainstream-quality NBs because these NBs become a compromise or middle option in terms of quality in the retailer's assortment.

Thus, little guidance is available to firms regarding the relative efficacy of their various marketing expenditures over the long run. To investigate this issue, the authors apply a multivariate dynamic linear transfer function model to five years of advertising and scanner data for 25 product categories and 70 brands in France. The findings indicate that the total (short-term plus long-term) sales elasticity is 1.37 for product and .74 for distribution. Conversely, the total elasticities for advertising and discounting are only .13 and .04, respectively. This result stands in marked contrast to the previous emphasis in the literature on price promotions and advertising. The authors further find that the long-term effects of discounting are one-third the magnitude of the short-term effects.

Study 1 provides evidence that endpoints of the range of alternative prices are more predictive of ratings of price attractiveness than of purchase intentions, while price rank and distribution mean are more predictive of purchase intentions ratings than of price attractiveness ratings. Study 2 replicates this effect using a different methodology. Finally, Study 3 provides a test of the external validity of these findings in a multicue setting.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.983","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processing differences in consumer judgments and choices without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A major question is whether consumers continue to be willing to pay a price premium for NBs over PLs. Using consumer survey data from 22,623 respondents from 23 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas across, on average, 63 consumer packaged goods categories per country, this article studies how marketing and manufacturing factors affect the price premium a consumer is willing to pay for an NB over a PL. These effects are mediated by consumer perceptions of the quality of NBs in relation to PLs. Although the results do not bode well for NBs in the sense that willingness to pay decreases as PLs mature, the authors offer several managerial recommendations to counter this trend. In countries in which PLs are more mature, the route to success is to go back to manufacturing basics. In PL development countries, there is a stronger role for marketing to enhance the willingness to pay for NBs.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1011","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['price premium', 'national brands', 'private labels', 'consumer perceptions']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this article, the authors study how closure of a particular store affects the chain sales of a multioutlet retailer operating multiple formats. The authors show that the chain sales losses from a closure vary widely across outlets (ranging from less than 30% to more than 80% of the closed outlet's revenue) and depend not only on the closed store's format and distance to competitors but also on the profile of its clientele and type of shopping trip. The authors offer a methodology for predicting the magnitude of these losses for specific store closures that outperforms models calibrated on observed \u201cregular\u201d shopping patterns. This approach offers guidance to retailers in deciding whether a particular store closure is beneficial to the chain or, if the objective is to prune an overly dense network, which of a set of local outlets is the best candidate for closure.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1025","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic implications of store closures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a large-scale longitudinal data set, the authors find that positive changes in customer satisfaction not only improve analyst recommendations but also lower dispersion in those recommendations for the firm. These effects are stronger when product market competition is high and financial market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendations at least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value. Thus, if analysts pay attention to Main Street customer satisfaction, Wall Street investors should have good reason to listen and follow. Overall, this research reveals the impact of satisfaction on analyst-based outcomes and firm value metrics and calls attention to the construct of customer satisfaction as a key intangible asset for the investor community.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1041","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['customer satisfaction', 'analyst recommendations', 'firm value']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of customer satisfaction and analyst recommendations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In contrast to those findings, the authors demonstrate that the effects of metacognitive experiences on evaluation are sensitive to the consumption domain. In the domain of everyday goods, metacognitive difficulty reduces the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unfamiliar. However, in the context of special-occasion products, for which consumers value exclusivity, metacognitive difficulty increases the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unique or uncommon.

Specifically, category, or generic, messages should communicate information only about the disease without promoting any brand, whereas brand-level messages should be void of any therapeutic information. This brings up two questions of great managerial importance: Which type of message is generally more effective (category or brand level), and when is one type more effective than the other? The authors pursue these questions by analyzing the effects of advertising on new and refill prescriptions through the use of an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations. The findings suggest the presence of complex dynamics for both types of regulation-induced advertising messages. In general, brand advertising is more effective, especially after competitive entry.

Conversely, the supply-side analysis suggests that manufacturers in the empirical application do not consider quantity-discount effects when setting prices.

Specifically, food that enhances the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin can reduce impulsive choice. To test the hypotheses on the influence of serotonin on postconsumption impulsive choice, the authors collected data on the eve of Thanksgiving. The occasion of Thanksgiving dinner provides a naturalistic setting in which people consume a tryptophan-rich meal (tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin).

Focusing on the role of customer power in limiting the managerial discretion available to CMOs, this study identifies individual and firm-specific conditions in which CMOs contribute more or less to firm value.

The method involves the optimization of a linear programming problem in the spirit of the Lasso method with a large number of decision variables. The numerical experience reported shows that a rather direct use of the standard column generation strategy leads to a classification method that, in terms of classification ability, is competitive against the standard linear SVM and classification trees. Moreover, the proposed method is robust; i.e., it is stable in the presence of outliers and invariant to change of scale or measurement units of the predictor variables.

Building on the success of the first competition in 2002, this sequel aimed to further develop research activity in the area of educational timetabling. The broad aim of the competition was to create better understanding between researchers and practitioners by allowing emerging techniques to be developed and tested on real-world models of timetabling problems. To support this, a primary goal was to provide researchers with models of problems faced by practitioners through incorporating a significant number of real-world constraints. Another objective of the competition was to stimulate debate within the widening timetabling research community. The competition was divided into three tracks to reflect the important variations that exist in educational timetabling within higher education. Because these formulations incorporate an increased number of \u201creal-world\u201d issues, it is anticipated that the competition will now set the research agenda within the field.

One effective approach, which is based on a Bayesian probability model for the unknown mean performance of each alternative, allocates samples based on maximizing an approximation to the expected value of information (EVI) from those samples. The approximations include asymptotic and probabilistic approximations. This paper derives sampling allocations that avoid most of those approximations to the EVI but entails sequential myopic sampling from a single alternative per stage of sampling.

One of these heuristics is Wedelin's algorithm, which works for the limited class of 0-1 integer programs. A big advantage of Wedelin's approach is that it does not depend on a solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation as many other heuristics do. This makes it extremely fast in practice and makes it easy to use the parallelism of the upcoming multicore CPUs, as in an integer programming (IP) solver it could be applied in parallel to the traditional branch-and-bound algorithm. In this paper, we present several extensions and generalizations to Wedelin's algorithm (most can be handled in an implicit manner without much performance cost) and investigate different ways of improving it. We give all necessary details and parameters. We strive for an algorithm that is faster than other heuristics but achieves comparable solution quality. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a large set of more than 100 instances from different sources. The results indicate that our heuristic often finds solutions comparable to or even better than those found using current state-of-the-art heuristics while typically needing only a fraction of their running time. Additionally, we report positive findings on the application of the heuristic on feasibility instances from discrete tomography. Our algorithm always finds the IP optimum in less time than the simplex/barrier algorithms and often in less time than it takes the volume algorithm to find just the LP optimum.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0328","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of integer programming heuristics with no mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Both theoretical and practical issues concerning this procedure are analyzed, and important improvements are proposed. In particular, we use the dominance test not only to fathom the current node of the tree, but also to derive variable configurations called \u201cnogoods\u201d and, more generally, \u201cimproving moves.\u201d These latter configurations, which we rename \u201cpruning moves\u201d so as to stress their use in a node-fathoming context, are used during the enumeration to fathom large sets of dominated solutions in a computationally effective way.

Full use of the newly available genetic data often depends upon reconstructing genealogical relationships of individual organisms, such as sibling reconstruction. This paper presents a new optimization framework for sibling reconstruction from single generation microsatellite genetic data. Our framework is based on assumptions of parsimony and combinatorial concepts of Mendel's inheritance rules. Here, we develop a novel optimization model for sibling reconstruction as a large-scale mixed-integer program (MIP), shown to be a generalization of the set covering problem. We propose a new heuristic approach to efficiently solve this large-scale optimization problem. We test our approach on real biological data as presented in other studies as well as simulated data, and compare our results with other state-of-the-art sibling reconstruction methods. The empirical results show that our approaches are very efficient and outperform other methods while providing the most accurate solutions for two benchmark data sets. The results suggest that our framework can be used as an analytical and computational tool for biologists to better study ecological and evolutionary processes involving knowledge of familial relationships in a wide variety of biological systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0322","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization model for genetic data analysis with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although they are designed to exploit economies of scale, hub-and-spoke networks are known to favour congestion, jeopardizing the performance of the entire system. This paper looks at incorporating congestion and capacity decisions in the design stage of such networks. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (NMIP) that explicitly minimizes congestion, capacity acquisition, and transportation costs. Congestion at hubs is modeled as the ratio of total flow to surplus capacity by viewing the hub-and-spoke system as a network of M/M/1 queues. To solve the NMIP, we propose a Lagrangean heuristic where the problem is decomposed into an easy subproblem and a more difficult nonlinear subproblem. The nonlinear subproblem is first linearized using piecewise functions and then solved to optimality using a cutting plane method. The Lagrangean lower bound is found using subgradient optimization. The solution from the subproblems is used to find a heuristic solution. Computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing a sharp bound and in generating high-quality feasible solutions in most cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0335","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of hub-and-spoke network design, emphasizing efficiency and cost minimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","22","2","Sanjeeb DashSanjeeb Dashsanjeebd@us.ibm.comIBM T.

The 3D-CLP is the problem of loading a subset of a given set of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container so that the packing volume is maximized. The method includes two variants: the full-support variant guarantees full support from below for all packed boxes, although this constraint is not taken into account by the nonsupport variant. The guillotine cut constraint is considered by both variants. The method is mainly based on two concepts. On the one hand, the block building approach is generalized. Not only are blocks of identical boxes in the same spatial orientation applied but also blocks of different boxes with small inner gaps. On the other hand, the tree search is carried out in a special fashion called a partition-controlled tree search. This makes the search both efficient and diverse, enabling a sufficient search width as well as a suitable degree of foresight.

A common cost structure for flows in arcs for such problems involves both a fixed and variable cost. Combining the two concepts results in the uncapacitated time-space fixed-charge network flow problem. These problems can be modeled as mixed binary linear programs and can be solved with commercial software. To create these models for uncapacitated arcs requires determining artificial arc capacities that are sufficiently large so that the solution space has not been altered but are small enough that the linear programming relaxations are tight. In this investigation, we present a strategy for determining these artificial arc capacities for any time-space fixed-charge network flow problem. In extensive empirical tests, we provide statistical evidence that the strategy is superior to the usual techniques applied to this class of problem. Many of the most difficult problems were solved in only 5% of the computational time required by standard techniques.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0354","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in logistics and network flow optimization without any mention of socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2010","22","2","Daniel JupiterDaniel Jupiterdjupiter@tamu.eduDepartment of Systems Biology and Translational Medicine, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Temple, Texas 76504Search for more papers by this author, Jessica \u015eahuto\u011fluJessica \u015eahuto\u011flusahutj@ewashtenaw.orgWashtenaw Community Health Organization, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48198Search for more papers by this author, Vincent VanBurenVincent VanBurenvanburen@tamu.eduDepartment of Systems Biology and Translational Medicine, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Temple, Texas 76504Search for more papers by this author","TreeHugger: A New Test for Enrichment of Gene Ontology Terms","The Gene Ontology (GO) project provides a structured vocabulary of biological terms used by biological researchers as a tool for standardization of references to biological entities. Genes may be annotated with GO terms to indicate their roles or localizations in the cell. GO has been used in conjunction with high-throughput experimental methods, such as microarrays. In this setting, the interest is to determine whether sets of genes identified by the high-throughput experiment are enriched for GO terms: Do certain terms annotate more genes in the identified set than one might expect? Enriched terms are taken as a potential summary of the cellular function for the identified set of genes and may provide clues leading to new directions for investigation. Current methods for determining whether sets of genes are GO-enriched have certain well-known shortcomings. Many methods do not take the hierarchical structure of the ontology into account in determining enrichment. We address this drawback by introducing a new statistical test (TreeHugger) based on a novel per-gene scoring scheme for GO terms. Given a set of genes and a specified subset of those genes, our method determines enrichment of GO terms in the subset, taking into account the structure of the ontology and ascribing a lower weight to those terms that do not themselves directly annotate the given genes. Tests on simulated and real data indicate that our method is a conservative test for enrichment. Testing TreeHugger on a biological example reveals that it also reduces the redundancy caused by giving high scores to indirect annotations as provided by standard enrichment tests.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0356","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for analyzing biological data without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, buyers are allowed to place bids on subsets of the available items. This paper focuses on a combinatorial auction where a bidder can express his preferences by means of a so-called ordered matrix bid. Ordered matrix bids are a bidding language that allows a compact representation of a bidder's preferences and was developed by Day [Day, R. W. 2004. Expressing preferences with price-vector agents in combinatorial auctions. Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park].

We discuss the relevance of recognizing whether a given matrix bid has properties related to elements of economic theory such as free disposal, subadditivity, submodularity, and the gross substitutes property. We show that verifying whether a matrix bid has these properties can be done in polynomial time by solving one or more shortest-path problems.

Whereas auction design has traditionally been an analytic process that relies on theory-driven assumptions such as bidders' rationality, bidders often exhibit unknown and variable behaviors. In this paper we present a data-driven adaptive auction mechanism that capitalizes on key properties of electronic auction markets, such as the large transaction volume, access to information, and the ability to dynamically alter the mechanism's design to acquire information about the benefits from different designs and adapt the auction mechanism online in response to actual bidders' behaviors. Our auction mechanism does not require an explicit representation of bidder behavior to infer about design profitability\u2014a key limitation of prior approaches when they address complex auction settings. Our adaptive mechanism can also incorporate prior general knowledge of bidder behavior to enhance the search for effective designs. The data-driven adaptation and the capacity to use prior knowledge render our mechanisms particularly useful when there is uncertainty regarding bidders' behaviors or when bidders' behaviors change over time. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that the adaptive mechanism outperforms any single fixed mechanism design under a variety of settings, including when bidders' strategies evolve in response to the seller's adaptation; our mechanism's performance is also more robust than that of alternatives when prior general information about bidders' behaviors differs from the encountered behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0353","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of auction mechanism design and bidder behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In contrast to homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains, where a large number of numerical analysis techniques are available and have been compared, few results about the performance of numerical techniques in the inhomogeneous case are known. This paper presents a new variant of the uniformization technique, the most efficient approach for homogeneous Markov chains. The new uniformization technique allows for the stable computation of strict bounds for the transient distribution of inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains, which is not possible with other numerical techniques that provide only an approximation of the distribution and asymptotic bounds. Furthermore, another variant of uniformization is presented that computes an approximation of the transient distribution and is shown to outperform standard differential equation solvers if transition rates change slowly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0357","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of numerical analysis in Markov chains without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

This decomposition idea opens up the possibility of obtaining approximate solutions by concentrating on one flight leg at a time, but the capacity allocation and overbooking problem that takes place over a single flight leg still turns out to be intractable. We use a state aggregation approach to obtain high-quality solutions to the single-leg problem. Overall, our model constructs separable approximations to the value functions, which can be used to make the capacity allocation and overbooking decisions for the whole airline network.

Procedures to find replication origins, which are initiation sites of the DNA replication process, are therefore of great importance for controlling the growth and spread of such viruses. Existing computational methods for viral replication origin prediction have mostly been tested within the family of herpesviruses. This paper proposes a new approach by least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) and tests its performance not only on the herpes family but also on a collection of caudoviruses coming from three viral families under the order of caudovirales. The LS-SVM approach provides sensitivities and positive predictive values superior or comparable to those given by the previous methods. When suitably combined with previous methods, the LS-SVM approach further improves the prediction accuracy for the herpesvirus replication origins. Furthermore, by recursive feature elimination, the LS-SVM has also helped find the most significant features of the data sets. The results suggest that the LS-SVMs will be a highly useful addition to the set of computational tools for viral replication origin prediction and illustrate the value of optimization-based computing techniques in biomedical applications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0360","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses purely on a technical approach to viral replication origin prediction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The solver is based on an algorithm of Quesada and Grossmann [Quesada, I., I. E. Grossmann. 1992. An LP/NLP based branch-and-bound algorithm for convex MINLP optimization problems. Comput. Chemical Engrg.16(10\u201311) 937\u2013947] that avoids the complete re-solution of a master mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by adding new linearizations at open nodes of the branch-and-bound tree whenever an integer solution is found. The new solver, FilMINT, combines the MINTO branch-and-cut framework for MILP with filterSQP to solve the nonlinear programs that arise as subproblems in the algorithm. The MINTO framework allows us to easily employ cutting planes, primal heuristics, and other well-known MILP enhancements for MINLPs. We present detailed computational experiments that show the benefit of such advanced MILP techniques. We offer new suggestions for generating and managing linearizations that are shown to be efficient on a wide range of MINLPs. By carefully incorporating and tuning all these enhancements, an effective solver for convex MINLPs is constructed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0373","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for optimization problems without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

Our approach is based on an existing linear programming-based fluence map optimization model that approximates dose-volume requirements using conditional value-at-risk (C-VaR) constraints. We show how the parameters of the C-VaR constraints can be used to control various metrics of treatment plan quality. Next, we develop an automated search strategy for parameter tuning. Finally, beam angle selection is integrated with fluence map optimization. The beam angle selection scheme employs a bicriteria scoring of beam angle geometries and a selection mechanism to choose from among the set of nondominated geometries. The overall technology is automated and generates several high-quality treatment plans satisfying dose prescription requirements in a single invocation and without human guidance.

It combines features of the uncapacitated facility location problem with the Steiner tree problem and is known to be NP-complete. In this setting, we wish to install a set of facilities on a communication network and assign customers to the installed facilities. In addition, the set of selected facilities needs to be connected by a Steiner tree. In this paper, we propose a dual-based local search heuristic that combines dual ascent and local search, which together yield strong lower and upper bounds to the optimal solution. Our procedure is applied to a slightly more general version of the ConFL problem that embraces a family of four different problems\u2014the Steiner tree-star problem, the general Steiner tree-star problem, the ConFL problem, and the rent-or-buy problem\u2014that combine facility location decisions with connectivity requirements. Consequently, our solution methodology successfully applies to all of them.

An appropriate allocation of certain capability-related, intent-related, vulnerability-related, and consequence-related resources is used to reduce the probabilities of success in the respective attack-related actions and to ameliorate losses in case of a successful attack. We adopt a nested event tree optimization framework and formulate the problem as a specially structured nonconvex factorable program. We develop two branch-and-bound schemes based, respectively, on utilizing a convex nonlinear relaxation and a linear outer approximation, both of which are proven to converge to a global optimal solution. We also design an alternative direct mixed-integer programming model representation for this case, and we investigate a fundamental special-case variant for this scheme that provides a relaxation and affords an optimality gap measure. Several range reduction, partitioning, and branching strategies are proposed, and extensive computational results are presented to study the efficacy of different compositions of these algorithmic ingredients, including comparisons with the commercial software BARON.

An agent-based simulation model is developed to investigate the dynamics of MRSA transmission within a hospital. The simulation model is used to examine the effectiveness of various infection control procedures and explore more specific questions relevant to hospital administrators and policy makers. Simulation experiments are performed to examine the effects of hand-hygiene compliance and efficacy, patient screening, decolonization, patient isolation, and health-care worker-to-patient ratios on the incidence of MRSA transmission and other relevant metrics. Experiments are conducted to investigate the dynamic between the number of colonizations directly attributable to nurses and physicians, including rogue health-care workers who practice poor hygiene.

The previous research is inconsistent in its findings about the relationship between SCI and performance. We attribute this inconsistency to incomplete definitions of SCI, in particular, the tendency to focus on customer and supplier integration only, excluding the important central link of internal integration. We study the relationship between three dimensions of SCI, operational and business performance, from both a contingency and a configuration perspective. In applying the contingency approach, hierarchical regression was used to determine the impact of individual SCI dimensions (customer, supplier and internal integration) and their interactions on performance. In the configuration approach, cluster analysis was used to develop patterns of SCI, which were analyzed in terms of SCI strength and balance. Analysis of variance was used to examine the relationship between SCI pattern and performance. The findings of both the contingency and configuration approach indicated that SCI was related to both operational and business performance. Furthermore, the results indicated that internal and customer integration were more strongly related to improving performance than supplier integration.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.06.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain integration and performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The process through which buyers make decisions in the face of these risks, however, has not been explored. Despite research highlighting the importance of behavioral approaches to risk, there is limited research that applies these views of risk in the supply chain literature. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on behavioral risk theory to investigate the causal relationships amongst situation, representations of risk, and decision-making within the purchasing domain. We operationalize and explore the relationship between three representations of supply disruption risk: magnitude of supply disruption, probability of supply disruption, and overall supply disruption risk. Additionally, we draw on exchange theories to identify product and market factors that impact buyers\u2019 perceptions of the probability and magnitude of supply disruption. Finally, we look at how representations of risk affect the decision to seek alternative sources of supply. We test our model using data collected from 223 purchasing managers and buyers of direct materials. Our results show that both the probability and the magnitude of supply disruption are important to buyers\u2019 overall perceptions of supply disruption risk. We also find that product and market situational factors impact perceptions of risk, but they are best understood through their impact on perceptions of probability and magnitude. Finally, we find that decisions are based on assessments of overall risk. These findings provide insight into the decision-making process and show that all three representations of risk are necessary for fully understanding risky decision-making with respect to supply disruptions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.07.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain risk and decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper develops a model of commitment-gaining success that is based on intra-organizational influence theory. The model also includes project payback, customer pressure, government regulation, top management support and the project champion's position in the organizational hierarchy. The model was tested using survey data from 241 environmental professionals describing their attempts to gain the buy-in of purchasing managers, operations managers, industrial engineers and others for environmental projects. The results (obtained from hierarchical regression analysis) show that intra-organizational commitment is positively associated with the project champion's influence behavior\u2014in particular, the champion's use of three influence tactics (inspirational appeals, consultation and rational persuasion) and avoidance of a fourth tactic (ingratiation). Commitment is also positively associated with project payback and with top management support for the environment and negatively associated with environmental regulation. The paper contributes to the OM knowledge base on environmental project implementation by bringing new theory to bear on the topic, by focusing on individual-level, rather than organization-level, variables and by taking a confirmatory, large sample approach which complements extant exploratory research. In addition, the paper contributes to the OM field by evaluating various antecedents to cross-functional integration. The results also provide specific guidance to those who champion environmental projects within their companies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.09.001","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['environmental', 'commitment', 'influence', 'sustainability']","The article focuses on environmental projects and the commitment required to implement them, indicating a moderate emphasis on sustainability and ethical organizational practices.

However, some studies reverse this causal ordering, arguing that the performance gains attributed to prior relational activity predict the strength of the dyadic relationship in future time periods. While supported, both of these perspectives on relationship strength/performance dynamics are incomplete, as the research studies are only cross-sectional snapshots of the phenomenon. We remedy this gap in the existing literature by examining the dynamic cyclical linkage between relationship strength and performance of a buyer\u2013supplier relationship in a longitudinal setting, using a relationship strength\u2013performance spiral model. Results of testing a multiyear sample of 323 buyer\u2013supplier relationships in the construction industry indicate not only that relationships tend to spiral positively following relationship initiation, but also that positive relationship spirals will self-correct following multiple associations of alternating increases. These findings advance theory on buyer\u2013supplier relationships, and provide insight for companies looking to improve supply chain outcomes through superior relationship management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.07.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['relationship', 'performance', 'supply chain']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of buyer-supplier relationships and performance metrics without addressing any social justice or ethical themes.

However, it is unclear if collaborative relationships provide benefits that compensate for the additional expense associated with such relationships. Further, it is unclear what factors promote successful collaborations. This research examines collaborative relationships in two separate studies using structural equation modeling: one study examines buyers\u2019 perceptions and the second study examines suppliers\u2019 perceptions. The two studies are then compared using invariance testing in order to determine economic and relational factors that drive satisfaction and performance from each party's perspective. Results show that collaborative activities, such as information sharing, joint relationship effort, and dedicated investments lead to trust and commitment. Trust and commitment, in turn, lead to improved satisfaction and performance. Results from the two independent studies exhibit similarities and differences; while the conceptual model is highly similar, certain paths vary in their significance and/or their importance across buyer and supplier firms such that buyers focus more on relationship outcomes while suppliers look to safeguard their transaction specific investments through information sharing and joint relationship effort.

In a buyer\u2013supplier\u2013supplier relationship triad, the buyer, as the contracting entity, influences the suppliers\u2019 behaviors and the relationship between them. By considering the relationships in such a triad, we are able to gain a richer and more realistic perspective of buyer\u2013supplier relationships. In this study, our goal is to examine supplier\u2013supplier relationships in buyer\u2013supplier\u2013supplier triads, focusing on how such relationships impact the supplier performance. We frame the supplier\u2013supplier relationship as co-opetition\u2014one in which competing suppliers work together to meet the buyer's requirements. We investigate the role of the buyer on such relationships, and how the buyer and co-opetitive supplier\u2013supplier relationships affect supplier performance. We find mixed empirical support for our hypotheses. However, we are able to demonstrate the dynamics of supplier\u2013supplier co-opetition in the buyer\u2013supplier\u2013supplier triad.

While the purported goal of outsourcing in supply chains is to derive a competitive advantage, it is not clear whether the outsourcing decisions of firms are always strategically aligned with their overall competitive strategy. In this paper we evaluate the degree of congruence (fit or alignment) between a firm's outsourcing drivers and its competitive priorities and assess the impact of congruence on both supply chain performance and business performance, using empirical data collected from manufacturing business units operating in the United States. We find outsourcing congruence across all five competitive priorities to be positively and significantly related to supply chain performance. We also find the level of supply chain performance in a firm to be positively and significantly associated with the firm's business performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.09.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on outsourcing strategies and their alignment with competitive priorities, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, the research literature is unclear about the extent and scope of the impact of IT use on plant operations. This study examines the impact of IT use on the structure, practices, and performance of manufacturing plants. Drawing on information systems and operations management literature, the study differentiates between plant IT use (i) at the process level, (ii) due to internal process integration, and (iii) due to customer and supplier collaboration, labeled as process intelligence, integration intelligence, and collaboration intelligence, respectively. The study also accounts for intelligence gathering due to statistical process control (SPC) practices. The proposed impacts of IT use are examined using data from a study sample of manufacturing plants from electronics, machinery and transportation component industries. Overall, the evidence suggests that SPC has a broader and more significant impact on many aspects of plant operations than the individual dimensions of IT use. However, the three dimensions of IT use do exhibit distinct effects on plant structure, practices, and performance. Process intelligence tends to be associated with plant size and productivity, while integration intelligence and collaboration intelligence tend to be associated with work practices related to increased organizational decentralization and a flexible technology focus.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.09.005","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of information technology in manufacturing without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","28","2","Joseph Sarkis,\u00a0\n                     Joseph Sarkis\n                     Graduate School of Management, Clark University, Worcester, USASearch for more papers by this authorPilar Gonzalez-Torre,\u00a0\n                     Pilar Gonzalez-Torre\n                     Universidad de Oviedo, Engineering School, Campus de Viesques, E33204 Gijon, Asturias, SpainSearch for more papers by this authorBelarmino Adenso-Diaz,\u00a0\n                     Belarmino Adenso-Diaz\n                     \n                        adenso@epsig.uniovi.es\n                     \n                     Universidad de Oviedo, Engineering School, Campus de Viesques, E33204 Gijon, Asturias, SpainSearch for more papers by this author","Stakeholder pressure and the adoption of environmental practices: The mediating effect of training","The influence of stakeholder pressure on the adoption of environmental practices has been established in the literature.

As the world becomes flat and boundaries break down, manufacturers need to understand the proper role of culture in order to obtain competitive advantage. Thus, the current study conducts a multilevel investigation of the impact of eight national and organizational culture dimensions (according to GLOBE framework) on manufacturing performance. An ANOVA comparison of 189 manufacturing plants between Eastern (Japan and South Korea) and Western (Germany, United States, Finland, and Sweden) countries indicates that organizational culture inside plants differs in three dimensions (power distance, future orientation, and performance orientation). Hierarchical Linear Modeling analysis further suggests that organizational culture has more of an effect on manufacturing performance than national culture or the fit between them.

Hypotheses are developed and tested based on the cultural concept of individualism/collectivism, the theory of performance frontiers, and the extent of economic development. More specifically, data collected from 639 manufacturing plants in nine countries are used to first assess the influence of the cultural trait of individualism/collectivism on the extent of investment in structural assets (specifically: physical and capital-based) and infrastructural assets (specifically: team-based methods and improvement programs). Second, the influence of the extent of economic development on these investment factors is measured. Third, evidence is provided supportive of the theory of performance frontiers, and the nature of resource investments in the context of the cultural construct of individualism/collectivism. And fourth, support is provided for the efficacy of this theory, as well as for its compatibility and association with the resource-based view of the firm.

Yet quality problems in China have raised concerns among managers and researchers as to how to assure product quality from Asian facilities. Implementing quality management practices may accomplish this, but such practices assume specific cultural values exist in certain Asian cultures. Using global manufacturing and cultural data, this study examines if cultural values in Asian and non-Asian countries moderate how effective quality management practices are at improving quality performance. Through the use of multilevel modeling, differences in quality management effectiveness are found among the East Asian cultures of China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Moreover, this study finds that specific cultural dimensions are statistically related to quality management effectiveness. The results of this study will assist managers in devising plans to assure higher quality from East Asian facilities and in predicting where problems may occur in other countries around the world.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.11.003","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['culture', 'quality management', 'globalization']","The article discusses the influence of cultural values on quality management practices, indicating an awareness of cultural differences.

In particular, we conceptually argue and empirically confirm the links between learning intent, capability enhancement, governance mode, and overall innovativeness from the perspective of local suppliers in offshore OEM cooperation in China as well as the influence of local business culture within these links. We address two issues: (1) offshore OEM cooperation can be a unique opportunity for local suppliers with strong intent to learn from foreign buyers for capability enhancement and (2) the moderating effects of trust and contact as two distinctive governance modes. Addressing the two issues, we make two specific contributions to the research on inter-firm cooperation, both of which derive from the often-neglected theoretical lens of transaction value. Our general contribution lies in the extension of the transaction value perspective by specifying its dual tenets of inter-firm co-specialization and shared-trust as the central theme of inter-firm cooperation to complement the transaction cost economics and also contextualize the research on inter-firm cooperation in terms of different partners\u2019 perspectives as well as different governance modes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.11.006","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['local suppliers', 'emerging economies', 'cooperation']","The article discusses the role of offshore OEM cooperation in enhancing the capabilities of local suppliers in emerging economies, which touches on themes of economic development and support for local businesses.

Our results support the notion that knowledge-creation practices influence the success of process improvement projects.

In large, complex projects (or programs), a manager cannot see the entire \u201cterritory\u201d between project start and completion and therefore must rely on models or \u201cmaps\u201d to support planning and decisions. When it comes to planning and coordinating work, project managers commonly use a variety of process model views such as flowcharts, Gantt charts, responsibility assignment matrices, and narrative descriptions. However, these views may not contain the right information to best support the purpose or decision at hand. This paper investigates the fit between model views (a kind of technology) and the managerial decisions (a kind of task) they support. Through analysis of the literature and case study data, this research identifies: (1) a set of 28 purposes for which managers draw upon process models for decision support, (2) a set of 15 views of process models, and (3) a set of 56 information attributes involved in supporting the purposes and provided by the views. The paper develops new measures of the sufficiency and extraneousness of the attributes for each purpose and view. Analysis of the evidence suggests substantial misalignment between managers\u2019 purposes and tools.

In this paper we contribute to the resolution of this debate by using a total effects approach within the contingency perspective. We propose a culture-quality system design-outcomes framework for TQM implementation. We then use this framework to study the differences in total effects relationships among TQM constructs across four contingencies, firm size, TQM duration, unionization, and industry type. Data from a sample of 394 plants (SIC codes 20 through 39) are used to test the validity of our contingency model. Our results revealed that firm size, TQM duration, and industry type moderate the influence of total effects of culture (top management commitment, customer focus, and trust) on final outcomes (process quality, product quality, and customer satisfaction). These contingencies also moderate the influence of total effects of quality system design (design management, training, empowerment, quality information usage, supplier quality management, and process quality management) on final outcomes. The strongest contributor to variation in total effects across groups was industry type, followed by size and then TQM duration. To a lesser extent, unionization was a moderator in total effects relationships. These findings uniquely contribute to the emerging contingency theory of TQM implementation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.11.009","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['unionization', 'industry context', 'culture']","The article discusses unionization and industry context, which touch on labor relations and organizational culture, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Journal citation metrics provide a measure for the exchange of scholarly ideas. Operations Management (OM) journals show a willingness to cross-pollinate ideas with other management disciplines. But, they also tend to have a higher level of self citations and lower level of within discipline citation exchanges when compared to other management disciplines. As a result, Operations Management journals may reflect methodological silos in the field that could potentially dampen scholarly exchange.

The results of a survey of 131 firms suggest that the dimensions of institutional pressures (i.e., normative, mimetic, and coercive pressures) have differential effects on eSCM adoption intention. While mimetic pressures are not related to eSCM adoption intention, normative and coercive pressures are positively associated with eSCM adoption intention. In addition, organizational culture (i.e., flexibility orientation and control orientation) plays different roles in the relationships between these three dimensions of institutional pressures and eSCM adoption intention. While flexibility orientation negatively moderates the effects of coercive pressures and positively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures, control orientation positively moderates the effects of coercive and normative pressures and negatively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures.

Drawing from the theoretical grounding of transaction cost economics, personality trait theory, and contingency theory, we proposed three distinct perspectives on opportunism mitigation in buyer\u2013supplier relationships: (1) organizationalist, (2) individualist, and (3) interactionist, where relational norms, agent cooperativeness, and the interaction between them, respectively, serve as the key predictors in these three perspectives. The results of replicated experiments indicated that relational norms and agent cooperativeness interact with each other in mitigating opportunism and that the interactionist perspective yielded the highest explained variance in opportunism. This suggests that the interactionist perspective, a multi-level theoretical lens encompassing the dynamic interplay between organization-level and individual-level factors, was a more complete model in explaining opportunism than either the organizationalist or individualist perspectives. The consensus which emerged from post-experimental interviews of purchasing professionals is that agent personalities play an important role in buyer\u2013supplier relationships. Some purchasing professionals had observed that uncooperative agents or personnel turnover in the boundary-spanning functions can substantially undermine even established relational exchanges. These qualitative findings are in line with our theoretical arguments and experimental outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.12.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['relational norms', 'cooperativeness', 'opportunism']","The article focuses primarily on operational dynamics and economic theories without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Drawing upon March's (1991) notions of exploration and exploitation, an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is conceptualized as a simultaneous pursuit of both explorative and exploitative supply chain practices. We operationalize this concept as a second-order latent construct that captures the co-variation between exploration and exploitation within the context of a manufacturer's supply chain management strategy. Using survey-based data gathered from 174 U.S. manufacturers, we find that an ambidextrous supply chain strategy coincides with combinative competitive capabilities and business performance. Our empirical finding contradicts conventional wisdom that argues for tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. Instead, our empirical results are in line with an emerging complementarity view advocating that supply chain managers build practices to gain operational efficiency while simultaneously searching for opportunities to gain operational advantages. In addition, we provide insights regarding the role of combinative capabilities in mediating the relationship between an ambidextrous supply chain strategy and business performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.12.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain strategy and competitive capabilities without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine the market reaction to two categories of environmental performance. The first category includes 417 announcements of Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs) that provide information about self-reported corporate efforts to avoid, mitigate, or offset the environmental impacts of the firm's products, services, or processes. The second category includes 363 announcements of Environmental Awards and Certifications (EACs) that provide information about recognition granted by third-parties specifically for environmental performance. Although the market does not react significantly to the aggregated CEI and EAC announcements, we find statistically significant market reactions for certain CEI and EAC subcategories.

In each year, three latent clusters are identified via ordered restricted latent class models; the cluster that consistently makes a more integrated use of practices outperforms the others. Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of the data permits modeling the growth curves of each practice in the sample, recognizing any similarity in growth and investigating whether or not an early integration in adoption of practices is associated with higher final productivity.

A cross-national supply chain investigation","In global business-to-business markets, shared resources between buyers and suppliers often result in competitive advantages and enhanced relationships between firms. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research regarding learning capabilities between business partners in a cross-border setting. This study takes the approach to integrate customer value literature into interorganizational learning theory and adopts the often-neglected theoretical perspective of transaction value by contextualizing inter-firm collaboration in terms of relationship learning and value co-creation viewed by both the buyers and sellers in one single study. Through the development of a conceptual framework that examines how global environmental and inter-organizational conditions influence learning capabilities, the study investigates how relationship learning influences relationship value for both supplying and buying firms. Using a survey of 126 cross-border dyads in the industrial chemical, packaging, consumer durable, and apparel industries, the authors show how relationship learning is valued by both buyers and suppliers, and how it is critical when viewing the \u201csupplier as a customer.\u201d The results indicate the strategic nature of relationship learning in maintaining cross-border business-to-business relationships. Simultaneously, the findings provide evidence that cultural distance is not a significant influence on the firm's propensity to share knowledge with its global partners.

Understanding the dynamic of key contextual factors and their effects on a firm's resource capabilities and inter-organizational power structure is crucial for identifying the appropriate governance structure over time. In this paper we explore the exchanges between an OEM and five of its strategic suppliers that operate in high-end, short product life cycle motorbike industry, to understand the key contextual factors and the relationships among business context, governance structure, and exchange practices in a dyadic context. It is observed that firms deviate from the conventional choices of either transactional or relational governance to a combination of contractual and relational aspects to make the governance structure effective. Based on case studies, a theoretical framework is proposed to explain the rationale, feasibility and effectiveness of combining contractual and relational aspects in different contexts. The framework suggests that the degree of strategic interdependence between the trading partners fundamentally drives the effectiveness of governance structure and exchange practices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['governance', 'inter-organizational', 'contextual factors']","The article primarily focuses on governance structures and supplier performance without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Using data collected from published discourse and annual IT budgets of 109 large companies for a decade, I have found that firms whose names were associated with IT fashions in the press did not have higher performance, but they had better reputation and higher executive compensation in the near term.  Companies investing in IT in fashion also had higher reputation and executive pay, but they had lower performance in the short term and then improved performance in the long term.  These results support a fashion explanation for the middle phase diffusion of IT innovations, illustrating that following fashion can legitimize organizations and their  leaders regardless of performance improvement.

Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve their software development agility.  However, the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and practices of agile development.  Little research has empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development performance.  As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.\n\nUsing an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of software development agility (software team response extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality).  Our PLS results of survey responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived by the literature.  The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between response extensiveness and response efficiency.  These two agility dimensions impact software development performance differently:  response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness positively affects only software functionality.  The results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness.  We conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate our PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance.  The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported and unsupported hypotheses.

A Study of Customer Reviews on Amazon.com","Customer reviews are increasingly available online for a wide range of products and services.

While researchers have demonstrated the benefits of the presence of customer reviews to an online retailer, a largely uninvestigated issue is what makes customer reviews helpful to a consumer in the process of making a purchase decision. Drawing on the paradigm of search and experience goods from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness.  An analysis of 1,587 reviews from Amazon.com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review.  Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review.  For experience goods, reviews with extreme ratings are less helpful than reviews with moderate ratings.  For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review.  Review depth has a greater positive effect on the helpfulness of the review for search goods than for experience goods.

An fMRI Study on the Perceived Trustworthiness of eBay Offers","Research provides increasing evidence that women and men differ in their decisions to trust.  However, information systems research does not satisfactorily explain why these gender differences exist.  One possible reason is that, surprisingly, theoretical concepts often do not address the most obvious factor that influences human behavior:  biology.  Given the essential role of biological factors\u2014and specifically those of the brain\u2014in decisions to trust, the biological influences should naturally include those related to gender.  As trust considerations in economic decision making have become increasingly complex with the expansion of Internet use, understanding the related biological/brain functions and the involvement of gender provides a range of valuable insights.\n\nTo show empirically that online trust is associated with activity changes in certain brain areas, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  In a laboratory experiment, we captured the brain activity of 10 female and 10 male participants simultaneous to decisions on trustworthiness of eBay offers.  We found that most of the brain areas that encode trustworthiness differ between women and men. Moreover, we found that women activated more brain areas than did men.  These results confirm the empathizing\u2013 systemizing theory, which predicts gender differences in neural information processing modes.\n\nIn demonstrating that perceived trustworthiness of Internet offers is affected by neurobiology, our study has major implications for both IS research and management.

Our extensive review of the literature suggests that the concept of IS strategy is a term that is used readily; however, it is also a term that is not fully understood. In this study, we follow a perspective paradigm based on the strategic management literature to define IS strategy as an organizational perspective on the investment in, deployment, use, and management of IS.  Through a systematic literature search, we identify the following three conceptions of IS strategy employed implicitly in 48 articles published in leading IS journals that focus on the construct of IS strategy: (1) IS strategy as the use of IS to support business strategy; (2) IS strategy as the master plan of the IS function; and (3) IS strategy as the shared view of the IS role within the organization.  We find the third conception best fits our definition of IS strategy.  As such, we consequently propose to operationalize IS strategy as the degree to which the organization has a shared perspective to seek innovation through IS. Specifically, our proposed IS strategic typology suggests an organization\u2019s IS strategy falls into one of the two defined categories (i.e., IS innovator or IS conservative) or is simply undefined.  We also develop measures for this new typology. We argue that the proposed instrument, which was cross-validated across both chief information officers and senior business executives, has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool through which the organization can directly assess its IS strategy.  We contend that our reconceptualization and operationalization of IS strategy provides theoretical and practical implications that advance the current level of understanding of IS strategy from extant studies within three predominant literature streams: strategic IS planning, IS/business strategic alignment, and competitive use of IS.","https://misq.umn.edu/information-systems-strategy-reconceptualization-measurement-and-implications.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['strategy', 'innovation', 'organizational perspective']","The article focuses primarily on the conceptualization and measurement of information systems strategy without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Criminals often try to achieve financial, political, or personal gain through these attacks, so the threats that their actions prompt are insidious motivators for organizations to adopt information systems security (ISS) approaches.  Extant ISS research has traditionally examined ISS in e-commerce business organizations.  The present study investigates ISS within government, analyzing power relationships during an ISS standards adoption and accreditation process, where a head of state mandates that all government agencies are to comply with a national de jure ISS standard.  Using a canonical action research method, designated managers of ISS services across small, medium, and large agencies were monitored and assessed for progress to accreditation through surveys, interviews, participant observation at round table forums, and focus groups.  By 2008, accreditation status across the 89 agencies participating in this study was approximately 33 percent fully accredited, with 67 percent partially compliant. The research uses Clegg\u2019s (1989) circuits of power framework to interpret power, resistance, norms, and cultural relationships in the process of compliance.  The paper highlights that a strategy based on organization subunit size is helpful in motivating and assisting organizations to move toward accreditation.

Consequently, existing systems are susceptible to the myriad of obfuscation tactics used by fraudsters, resulting in highly ineffective fake website detection performance.  In light of these deficiencies, we propose the development of a new class of fake website detection systems that are based on statistical learning theory (SLT).  Using a design science approach, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate the potential utility of this class of systems.  We conducted a series of experiments, comparing the proposed system against several existing fake website detection systems on a test bed encompassing 900 websites.  The results indicate that systems grounded in SLT can more accurately detect various categories of fake websites by utilizing richer sets of fraud cues in combination with problem-specific knowledge.

Since employees who comply with the information security rules and regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening information security, understanding compliance behavior is crucial for organizations that want to leverage their human capital.\n\nThis research identifies the antecedents of employee compliance with the information security policy (ISP) of an organization.  Specifically, we investigate the rationality-based factors that drive an employee to comply with requirements of the ISP with regard to protecting the organization\u2019s information and technology resources.  Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with normative belief and self-efficacy, an employee\u2019s attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP.  As a key contribution, we posit that an employee\u2019s attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncompliance.  We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee\u2019s outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance:  benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost, vulnerability of resources, and sanctions.

Thus, with over one billion people with access to the Internet, individual home computer users represent a significant point of weakness in achieving the security of the cyber infrastructure.  We study the phenomenon of conscientious cybercitizens, defined as individuals who are motivated to take the necessary precautions under their direct control to secure their own computer and the Internet in a home setting.  Using a multidisciplinary, phased approach, we develop a conceptual model of the conscientious cybercitizen.  We present results from two studies\u2014a survey and an experiment\u2014conducted to understand the drivers of intentions to perform security-related behavior, and the interventions that can positively influence these drivers.

The findings of the two studies converged and indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control performance through greater awareness, greater alignment between IS security risk management and the business environment, and improved control development.  While the IS security literature often portrays users as the weak link in security, the current study suggests that users may be an important resource to IS security by providing needed business knowledge that contributes to more effective security measures.

Commentaries on methodological individualism within the reference disciplines suggest that studies embracing this paradigm can lead to potentially misleading or incorrect conclusions.  This study illustrates the appropriateness of the alternate non-reductionist approach to investigating group-related phenomenon, specifically in the context of technology adoption.  Drawing on theories of group influence, prior research on conflict, technology characteristics, task\u2013 technology fit, group communication media, and recent theoretical work surrounding group technology adoption, the paper proposes and empirically tests a new non-reductionist model for conceptualizing technology adoption by groups.  Further, the study also empirically compares this non-reductionist model with a (hypothetical) methodological individualist model of technology adoption by groups.  Results strongly support most of the assertions of the non-reductionist model and highlight that this model provides a more robust explanation of technology adoption by groups than a methodological individualist view.

First, we use this concomitant modality to explain why previous studies into the structure of the Information Systems discipline have reported contradictory results, with some finding a focused field while others conclude that the field is diverse.  In support of our argument, we then present the results of a longitudinal, author co-citation analysis, looking across the full range of journals in which IS research is published.  Our results suggest that the IS field has sustained a focus on research within three subfields over a 20-year period from 1986 to 2005:  (1) a thematic miscellany of research on development, implementation, and use of systems in various application domains; (2) IS strategy and business outcomes; and (3) group work and decision support.  At the same time, the field has demonstrated considerable diversity within and around these core subfields, with researchers responding flexibly to the rapidly changing field by investigating these areas with new paradigms and in new contexts, and by exploring new topics including inter-business and Internet applications, computer-supported collaborative work, virtual teams, and knowledge management.  Finally, we demonstrate that, over the 20-year period from 1986 to 2005, the discipline has shifted from fragmented adhocracy to a polycentric state, which is particularly appropriate to an applied discipline such as IS that must address the dual demands of focus and diversity in a rapidly changing technological context.","https://misq.umn.edu/focus-and-diversity-in-information-systems-research-meeting-the-dual-demands-of-a-healthy-applied-discipline.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['diversity', 'focus', 'sociology', 'research', 'paradigms']","The article discusses the importance of diversity in the Information Systems research field, which aligns with moderate woke themes of DEI and the need for ethical considerations in academic research.

Of the different IS security policy compliance approaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature.  Yet, few of the existing studies about training to promote IS policy compliance utilize theory to explain what learning principles affect user compliance with IS security policies, or offer empirical evidence of their practical effectiveness.  Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated.  Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories:  the universal constructive instructional theory and the elaboration likelihood model.  We then validate the training program for IS security policy compliance training through an action research project.  The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achieved positive results and was practical to deploy.  Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training.

However, research has been primarily based on cognitive models and little attention has been given to emotions.  This paper argues that emotions are important drivers of behaviors and examines how emotions experienced early in the implementation of new IT applications relate to IT use.  We develop a framework that classifies emotions into four distinct types:  challenge, achievement, loss, and deterrence emotions.  The direct and indirect rela tionships between four emotions (excitement, happiness, anger, and anxiety) and IT use were studied through a survey of 249 bank account managers.  Our results indicate that excitement was positively related to IT use through task adaptation.  Happiness was directly positively related to IT use and, surprisingly, was negatively associated with task adaptation, which is a facilitator of IT use.  Anger was not related to IT use directly, but it was positively related to seeking social support, which in turn was positively related to IT use. Finally, anxiety was negatively related to IT use, both directly and indirectly through psychological distancing.  Anxiety was also indirectly positively related to IT use through seeking social support, which countered the original negative effect of anxiety.  Post hoc ANOVAs were conducted to compare IT usage of different groups of users experiencing similar emotions but relying on different adaptation behaviors.  The paper shows that emotions felt by users early in the implementation of a new IT have important effects on IT use.  As such, the paper provides a complementary perspective to understanding acceptance and antecedents of IT use.

We derive and examine the implications of assuming constant stochastic variance for choices made under different conditions or at different times, in particular, whether substantive effects can arise purely as artifacts. These implications are tested via an experiment designed to isolate the effects of stochastic variation in choice behavior. Results strongly suggest that the stochastic component should be carefully modeled to differ across both available brands and temporal conditions, and that its variance may be relatively greater for choices made for the future. The experimental design controls for several alternative mechanisms (e.g., flexibility seeking), and a series of related models suggest that several econometrically detectable explanations like correlated error, state dependence, and variety seeking add no explanatory power.

Improved channel coordination is achieved through the internalization of advertising decisions from commercial forms of media (e.g., radio, TV, newspaper).

We start with the idea that people have a variety of reasons for making product recommendations, including placing a value on a friend's outcome with a product they recommend. We apply that idea in a context of asymmetric information: A customer combines his knowledge about the product and his familiarity with friends' tastes, making him more informed than the friends. Thus, the recommendation is a signal about the value of the product to the friend. In this setting, we consistently find that the greater the concern for others' outcomes, the higher the referral bonus should be, as long as the firm cannot more efficiently motivate recommendations with a lower price. Moreover, if price is the more efficient lever, the optimal bonus is zero, and the optimal price is low.

We find that while the higher-quality firm should always provide information resolving consumer uncertainty on product quality, the lower-quality firm under certain conditions will have the higher incentive to and will be the one to provide information resolving consumer uncertainty about their quality preferences. In the analysis, we trace the latter result to competition and to free-riding on the information provision. Specifically, in a monopoly market or when consumer free-riding is restricted by the costliness of store visits, the lower-quality firm would have a lower incentive to provide information resolving consumer preference uncertainty than otherwise. The model is also adapted to examine product returns as a possible strategy of information provision.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0486","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information provision and competitive strategies in marketing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Examples include purchase decisions involving families and organizations. A particularly unique aspect of a joint choice is that the group's preference is very likely to diverge from preferences of the individuals that constitute the group. For a marketing researcher, the biggest hurdle in measuring group preference is that it is often infeasible or cost prohibitive to collect data at the group level. Our objective in this research is to propose a novel methodology to estimate joint preference without the need to collect joint data from the group members. Our methodology makes use of both stated and inferred preference measures, and merges experimental design, statistical modeling, and utility aggregation theories to capture the psychological processes of preference revision and concession that lead to the joint preference. Results based on a study involving a cell phone purchase for 214 parent-teen dyads demonstrate predictive validity of our proposed method.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0490","","MKS","Marketing","2","['joint choice', 'individual data', 'group preference']","The article primarily focuses on a technical methodology for understanding consumer behavior in joint decision-making contexts without addressing any social justice or ethical implications.

Although supporting the overall thrust of Salisbury and Feinberg's critique of previous empirical work in the area, we also see their paper as illustrating the dangers of drawing strong inferences about the behavioral interpretation of statistical model parameters without seeking convergent empirical evidence. In particular, we are skeptical about the extent to which the reported effects of temporal distance on the estimated scale parameter, \u03c3c, are uniquely, or even primarily, due to unobserved error inflation that reflects consumer's uncertainty about future utility. This interpretation is brought into question by several lines of reasoning. Conceptually, we note that \u201cuncertainty\u201d is different from \u201cerror\u201d and that, for choice data, the error inflation model is mathematically identical to a model in which the scale parameter is a deterministic function of the temporal discount rate. Empirically, a reanalysis of data from previously published experiments does not consistently support temporal error inflation, temporal convergence of choice shares, or the scale parameter as an explanation of variety seeking in choice sequences. In our opinion, the cumulative results of research on intertemporal choice require models in which the attributes of choice alternatives are differentially discounted over time. Despite these findings, we advocate that choice researchers should indeed follow Salisbury and Feinberg's advice to not assume that error variances will be unaffected by experimental manipulations, and such effects should be explicitly modeled. We also agree that uncovering effects on error variance is just the first step, and the ultimate goal should be to rigorously explain the reasons for such effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0511","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of model development and empirical analysis in intertemporal choice without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

If so, do these biased judgments affect buyer behavior? Results from five studies suggest that buyers underestimate the magnitudes of precise prices. We term this the precision effect. The first three studies are laboratory experiments designed to test the existence of the precision effect and examine the underlying psychological processes. In Study 1, we find that precise prices are judged to be smaller than round prices of similar magnitudes. For example, participants in this experiment incorrectly judged $395,425 to be smaller than $395,000. In Study 2, we show that precision is more likely to affect magnitude judgments under conditions of uncertainty. Study 3 demonstrates that manipulating prior experience with the pattern of roundness and precision in numbers can moderate the precision effect. Studies 4 and 5 examine whether the precision effect influences buyers' willingness to pay for negotiated purchases (e.g., houses). In Study 4, we conduct an experiment on a nationally representative sample of homeowners to demonstrate that participants are willing to pay more for houses when the sellers use precise (e.g., $364,578) instead of comparable round (e.g., $365,000) prices. In Study 5, we analyze data from residential real estate transactions in two separate markets and find that buyers pay higher sale prices when list prices are more precise.

This self-reinforcing chain of inferences leads to poor kidney utilization despite the continual shortage in kidney supply. Counterfactual policy simulations show that patients would have made more efficient use of kidneys had the concerns behind earlier refusals been shared.

Second, the durable nature of technology products implies that even if two categories are related as complements, consumers may stagger their purchases over several periods. Third, the forward-looking consumer decision process, as well as the durable nature of technology products, implies that a consumer's purchase in one category will depend on the anticipated price and quality trajectories of all categories.

We model this advertising market, focusing on two of its key characteristics: (1) the interaction between the list of search results and the list of sponsored links on the search page and (2) the inherent differences in attractiveness between sites. We find that both of these special aspects of search advertising have a significant effect on sites' bidding behavior and the equilibrium prices of sponsored links. Often, sites that are not among the most popular ones obtain the sponsored links, especially if the marginal return of sites on clicks is quickly decreasing and if consumers do not trust sponsored links. In three extensions, we also explore (1) heterogeneous valuations across bidding sites, (2) the endogenous choice of the number of sponsored links that the search engine sells, and (3) a dynamic model where websites' bidding behavior is a function of their previous positions on the sponsored list.

The viral branching model is applied to an actual viral marketing campaign in which over 200,000 customers participated during a six-week period.

In practice, this measure requires a model that can predict the counterfactual market concentration under different parameter values capturing the strength of indirect network effects. We build such a model for the case of dynamic standards competition in a market characterized by the classic hardware/software paradigm. To demonstrate its applicability, we calibrate it using demand estimates and other data from the 32/64-bit generation of video game consoles, a canonical example of standards competition with indirect network effects. In our example, we find that indirect network effects can lead to a strong, economically significant increase in market concentration. We also find important roles for beliefs on both the demand side, as consumers tend to pick the product they expect to win the standards war, and on the supply side, as firms engage in penetration pricing to invest in growing their networks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0541","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for measuring market concentration due to indirect network effects without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In most applications of the model, the vector of consumer utility weights on product attributes is assumed to have a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution in the population. Thus, some consumers care more about some attributes than others, and the IIA property of multinomial logit (MNL) is avoided (i.e., segments of consumers will tend to switch among the subset of brands that possess their most valued attributes). The MIXL model is also appealing because it is relatively easy to estimate. Recently, however, some researchers have argued that the MVN is a poor choice for modelling taste heterogeneity. They argue that much of the heterogeneity in attribute weights is accounted for by a pure scale effect (i.e., across consumers, all attribute weights are scaled up or down in tandem). This implies that choice behaviour is simply more random for some consumers than others (i.e., holding attribute coefficients fixed, the scale of their error term is greater). This leads to a \u201cscale heterogeneity\u201d MNL model (S-MNL). Here, we develop a generalized multinomial logit model (G-MNL) that nests S-MNL and MIXL. By estimating the S-MNL, MIXL, and G-MNL models on 10 data sets, we provide evidence on their relative performance. We find that models that account for scale heterogeneity (i.e., G-MNL or S-MNL) are preferred to MIXL by the Bayes and consistent Akaike information criteria in all 10 data sets. Accounting for scale heterogeneity enables one to account for \u201cextreme\u201d consumers who exhibit nearly lexicographic preferences, as well as consumers who exhibit very \u201crandom\u201d behaviour (in a sense we formalize below).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0508","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical modeling in marketing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for lack of woke themes."],["2010","29","3","Nitin MehtaNitin Mehtanmehta@rotman.utoronto.caRotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, Xinlei (Jack) ChenXinlei (Jack) Chenjack.chen@sauder.ubc.eduSauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z2, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, Om NarasimhanOm Narasimhannaras002@umn.eduCarlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455Search for more papers by this author","Examining Demand Elasticities in Hanemann's Framework: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis","This paper examines demand elasticities using an integrated framework proposed by Hanemann [Hanemann, M. W. 1984. Discrete/continuous models of consumer demand. Econometrica52(3) 541\u2013561], which models the incidence, brand choice, and quantity decisions of a consumer as an outcome of her utility maximization subject to budget constraints. Although the Hanemann framework has been the mainstay of earlier efforts to examine these decisions jointly, empirical researchers who have used the it to study purchase behavior have often found that the quantity elasticities are around \u22121, regardless of the brand or category. We attempt to uncover the underlying reasons for this finding and propose approaches to get as close to the \u201ctrue\u201d quantity elasticities as possible. We do this by (i) analytically demonstrating how assumptions on the distribution of the brand-specific econometrician's errors imply certain restrictions that in turn force quantity elasticities to \u22121, (ii) discussing how these restrictions can be alleviated by considering a suitable specification of unobserved parameter heterogeneity, and (iii) using scanner data to empirically illustrate the impact of the restrictions on quantity elasticities and the relative efficacy of multiple specifications of unobserved heterogeneity in easing those restrictions. We find that the specification of unobserved heterogeneity crucially influences estimates of quantity elasticities and that the mixture normal specification outperforms the alternatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0524","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand elasticity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose two types of such local behavioral influences that, at each stage of a search process, can manifest themselves both in which of the products inspected up to that point is deemed to be the most preferred one (the product comparison decision) and whether to terminate the search at that stage (the stopping decision). The first of these influences is that consumers respond excessively to the attractiveness of the currently inspected product, at the expense of all others (\u201cfocalism\u201d). The second proposed behavioral influence is that consumers overreact to the difference in attractiveness between the current product and the one encountered just prior to it (\u201clocal contrast\u201d). Converging evidence from two experiments, which combine to guarantee both high internal and high external validity, provides support for the proposed behavioral influences. Our findings demonstrate that consumers' product comparison and stopping decisions in sequential product search are jointly governed by normative principles and by the proposed local behavioral influences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0525","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer decisions', 'behavioral model', 'normative influences']","The article focuses on a behavioral model of consumer product search, primarily emphasizing technical aspects of decision-making rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

We show that when information acquisition is sequential, the manufacturer may not acquire perfect information even if it is costless to do so. This self-restriction in information acquisition follows from the manufacturer's motivation to strategically influence retail behavior. When information acquisition is inflexible and constrained to be either zero or perfect information, the manufacturer acquires less (more) information under mandatory (voluntary) sharing. Moreover, voluntary sharing unambiguously leads to more information being generated, because the manufacturer has the option to strategically withhold the acquired information that turns out to be unfavorable.

However, one challenge of estimating econometric models based on panel survey data is how to account for underreporting; that is, respondents do not report behavioral incidences that actually occur. Underreporting is especially likely to occur in a panel survey because the data-recording mechanism is often tedious, complex, and effortful. The probability of underreporting is likely to vary across respondents and also over the duration of the survey period. In this paper, we propose a model to simultaneously study reported behavioral incidences and partially observed actual behavioral incidences. We propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the proposed model. We treat those unobserved actual behavioral incidences as latent variables, and the Gibbs sampler makes it convenient to impute the nonreported consumption incidences along with making inferences on other model parameters. Our proposed method has two advantages. First, it offers a model-based approach to remove the underreporting bias in panel survey data and therefore allows marketing researchers to make accurate inferences about consumers' actual behavior. Second, the method also offers a natural way to study factors that influence respondents' propensity to underreport. Because we treat those underreported behavioral incidences as nonmissing at random, this underreporting propensity varies across respondents and over time. This understanding can help marketing researchers design the right strategy to intervene and incentivize respondents to authentically report and hence improve the quality of survey data. The proposed model and estimation approach are tested on both synthetic data and actual panel survey data on consumer-reported beverage-drinking behavior. Our analysis suggests that underreporting can significantly mask respondents' true behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0536","","MKS","Marketing","3","['underreporting', 'behavior', 'authentically', 'survey data']","The article discusses underreporting bias in survey data, which touches on ethical considerations in data collection and the importance of accurate representation of consumer behavior.

For some durable products, such markets first appeared when retailers started buying back used products from \u201cold\u201d customers and selling them to new ones for a profit (retail used goods market). The growth of electronic peer-to-peer (P2P) markets opened up a second, frictionless used goods channel where new customers can buy used products directly from old customers (P2P used goods market). Both these markets compete with the original primary market where retailers sell unused products procured from the manufacturer. This paper focuses on understanding the role that the sequential emergence of the above two used goods markets plays in shaping the product upgrade strategy of the manufacturer and the pricing strategy of the primary market retailer in the context of a decentralized, dyadic channel dealing with a renewable set of consumers. Our analysis establishes that frequent product upgrades and rising retail prices in durable product sectors of our interest are due to the emergence of the P2P used goods market and how the market interacts with the retail used goods source in altering the relative powers of the channel partners. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, we show that the initial introduction of the retail used goods channel actually discourages introduction of new versions and restrains the rise in retail prices. We also comment on how the two used goods markets affect the profits of the channel partners. We then provide empirical support for our theoretical result regarding product upgrades using data from the college textbook industry, a durable product that fits our model setup.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0545","","MKS","Marketing","2","['used goods', 'durable products', 'retail pricing']","The article primarily focuses on market dynamics and pricing strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Using a game-theoretic model, we show that bundle discounts can help increase profits in a competitive market by creating endogenous loyalty, thereby reducing the intensity of promotional competition.

For consumers, the digital video recorder (DVR) offers the possibility to fast-forward through live programming. Whereas the DVR thus benefits consumers by reducing nuisance from commercials, industry observers believe that it may diminish advertisers' profits by rendering commercials ineffective. We use a model of informative advertising to study the effect of DVR penetration on competing advertisers' strategies and profits. We find that the overall effect of DVRs depends on the trade off between loss of advertising effectiveness and reduction in competition between firms. The latter effect arises because DVR penetration may increase the ratio of partially informed to fully informed consumers. We identify conditions under which an increase in DVR penetration counterintuitively leads firms to increase advertising levels and enjoy higher profits. Interestingly, we find that greater DVR penetration is beneficial for firms when the share of DVR owners in the population is above\u2014rather than below\u2014a threshold level. We also study the impact of different fast-forwarding (\u201czipping\u201d) behaviors on product market competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0544","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on advertising effectiveness and market competition without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

It studies a specific aspect of memory\u2014namely, the categorization of available price information that the consumers may need to recall for decision making. This paper analyzes competition between firms in a market with uninformed consumers who do not compare prices, informed consumers who compare prices but with limited memory, and informed consumers who have perfect memory. Consumers, aware of their memory limitations, choose how to encode the prices into categories, whereas firms take the limitations of consumers into account in choosing their pricing strategies. Two distinct types of categorization processes are investigated: (1) a symmetric one in which consumers compare only the labels of price categories from the competing firms and (2) an asymmetric one in which consumers compare the recalled price of one firm with the actual price of the other. We find that the equilibrium partition for the consumers calls for finer categorization toward the bottom of the price distribution. Thus consumers have a motivation to invest in greater memory resources in encoding lower prices to induce firms to charge more favorable prices. The interaction between the categorization strategies of the consumers and the price competition between the firms is such that small initial improvements in recall move the market outcomes quickly toward the case of perfect recall. Even with few memory categories, the expected price consumers pay and their surplus is close to the case of perfect recall. There is thus a suggestion in this model that market competition adjusts to the memory limitations of consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0546","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If BBP is profitable, when should the firm offer a lower price to its own customers rather than to the competitor's customers? This analysis considers two features of customer behavior up to now ignored in BBP literature: heterogeneity in customer value and changing preference (i.e., customer preferences are correlated but not fixed over time). In a model where both consumers and competing firms are forward-looking, we identify conditions when it is optimal to reward the firm's own or competitor's customers and when BBP increases or decreases profits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify conditions in which (1) it is optimal to reward one's own customers under symmetric competition and (2) BBP can increase profits with fully strategic and forward-looking consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0547","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on behavior-based pricing and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Despite the large number of independent providers that entered the market, phone companies accounted for 95.3% of all DSL subscribers in 2005. A common explanation for this is based on supply-side factors such as the costs faced by these providers to lease phone lines from phone companies, as well as the price discounts offered by phone companies. In this paper, we look for a demand-side explanation for this market outcome. Analyzing consumer choices in the broadband category alone would lead us to the conclusion that consumers have a much higher preference for their local phone providers\u2014a finding at odds with service awards received by independent DSL providers. Thus we look for a demand-side explanation that is based on the demand not just for broadband services but also for related services such as cable TV and local phone. We find evidence of strong complementarities between the consumption of broadband and of those related categories. The main source of such complementarities, in our data, is the benefits to consumers from having a single provider for multiple services. We then carry out counterfactual experiments assuming that there are no changes in the regular prices of the various services. Our results indicate that the share of phone companies in the broadband market would have been 43% smaller without complementarities stemming from such a single-provider effect, whereas shutting off the state dependence effects would have reduced their share by 30%, and shutting off the effects of price discounts on the DSL+local phone bundle would have resulted in their share declining by 21%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0551","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market dynamics and consumer preferences without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, we have little understanding of the impact of search engine advertising on consumers' responses in the presence of organic listings of the same firms. In this paper, we model and estimate the interrelationship between organic search listings and paid search advertisements. We use a unique panel data set based on aggregate consumer response to several hundred keywords over a three-month period collected from a major nationwide retailer store chain that advertises on Google. In particular, we focus on understanding whether the presence of organic listings on a search engine is associated with a positive, a negative, or no effect on the click-through rates of paid search advertisements, and vice versa for a given firm. We first build an integrated model to estimate the relationship between different metrics such as search volume, click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and keyword ranks. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework is used and the model is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our empirical findings suggest that click-throughs on organic listings have a positive interdependence with click-throughs on paid listings, and vice versa. We also find that this positive interdependence is asymmetric such that the impact of organic clicks on increases in utility from paid clicks is 3.5 times stronger than the impact of paid clicks on increases in utility from organic clicks. Using counterfactual experiments, we show that on an average this positive interdependence leads to an increase in expected profits for the firm ranging from 4.2% to 6.15% when compared to profits in the absence of this interdependence. To further validate our empirical results, we also conduct and present the results from a controlled field experiment. This experiment shows that total click-through rates, conversions rates, and revenues in the presence of both paid and organic search listings are significantly higher than those in the absence of paid search advertisements. The results predicted by the econometric model are also corroborated in this field experiment, which suggests a causal interpretation to the positive interdependence between paid and organic search listings.

This study addresses this gap in the literature by estimating a response model for theme park attendance. The model not only determines the contribution of each attraction to attendance, but also how this contribution is distributed within and across years. The model accommodates saturation effects, which imply that the impact of a new attraction is smaller if similar attractions are already present. It also captures reinforcement effects, meaning that a new attraction may reinforce the drawing power of similar extant attractions, especially when these were introduced recently. The model is calibrated on 25 years of weekly attendance data from the Efteling, a leading European theme park. Our return on investment calculations show that it is more profitable to invest in multiple smaller attractions than in one big one. This finding is in remarkable contrast with the current \u201carms race\u201d in the industry. Furthermore, even though thrill rides tend to be more effective than theme rides, there are conditions under which one should consider to switch to the latter.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0553","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on economic models and investment strategies in the theme park industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Prior studies have shown that community participants have high engagement and loyalty toward the firm and provide useful feedback and referrals. However, it is not clear whether community participants are the firm's \u201cfans\u201d to begin with and self-select themselves into the community, or whether community participation leads to increased relational customer behaviors. In the current research, we employ data from a field experiment to help answer this question. The data come from a year-long study conducted by eBay Germany, and they reveal that a simple e-mail invitation significantly increased customer participation in the firm's community. Results also show that community participation had mixed effects on customers' likelihoods of participating in buying and selling behaviors. Community participation did not translate into increased behaviors, as would be commonly expected. Although there is no impact of participation on the number of bids placed or the revenue earned, there is a negative impact of participation on the number of listings and the amount spent. Together, these results suggest that the community participants become more selective and efficient sellers, and they also become more conservative in their spending on the items for which they bid. The results also show that customer community marketing programs may be targeted to a broader set of the firm's customers than just the fans.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0555","","MKS","Marketing","3","['community', 'participation', 'social interactions']","The article discusses community participation and social interactions among customers, which indicates a focus on engagement and relational behaviors.

This paper shows that food vendors can profit handsomely by using supersizing strategies where regular portion sizes are priced sufficiently high to discourage price-conscious consumers from selecting them, and the prices for enlarging food portions are set so low that these customers are tempted to order the larger portion sizes and overeat. Setting aside the impact of obesity on health-care costs, we show that using supersizing to steer customers toward consuming excessive amounts of food can destroy value from a social perspective; thus this social value destruction trap adds another justification for pressuring food vendors to reduce supersizing for unhealthy food. As a public policy response, we consider how \u201cmoderating policies\u201d may counter these effects through measures designed specifically to encourage eating in moderation by applying supersizing bans, taxes, and warnings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0558","","MKS","Marketing","6","['social value', 'public policy', 'moderating policies', 'health-care costs']","The article discusses the social implications of supersizing unhealthy food and suggests public policy measures to address these issues, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and health ethics.

Decisions made by a group of customers are modeled to be an equilibrium outcome of an empirical discrete game, such that all group members must be satisfied with chosen outcomes. The game-theoretic approach assists estimation by allowing us to account for the endogeneity of group members' decisions while also serving as a managerial tool that can simulate equilibrium outcomes for the group when the firm alters the marketing mix to the group. The model builds upon the existing literature on empirical models of discrete games by introducing a random coefficients heterogeneity distribution. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that including the heterogeneity resolves the endogenous group formation bias commonly noted in the social interactions literature. By estimating the heterogeneous equilibrium model using Bayesian hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo, we can also recover some parameters at the individual level to evaluate group-specific characteristics and targeted marketing strategies. To validate the model and illustrate its implications, we apply it to a data set of groups of golfers. We find significant social interaction effects, such that 65% of the median customer value is attributable to the customer and the other 35% is attributable to the customer's affect on members of his group. We also consider targeted marketing strategies and show that group-level targeting increases profit by 1%, whereas targeting within groups can increase profitability by 20%. We recognize that customer backlashes to targeting could be greater when group members receive different offers, so we suggest some alternatives that could retain some of the profitability of within group targeting while avoiding customer backlashes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0559","","MKS","Marketing","3","['social interactions', 'targeted marketing', 'customer value']","The article discusses social interactions and their impact on marketing strategies, which hints at an awareness of customer dynamics beyond traditional profit metrics.

Although popular wisdom suggests that \u201cany publicity is good publicity,\u201d prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, we unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0557","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the impact of negative publicity on sales without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

However, these networks differ markedly on how they advertise their user base. Some highlight the number of sellers, some emphasize the number of buyers, and others disclose both. We use field experiment data from a business-to-business website to examine the efficacy of these different display formats. Before each potential seller posted a listing, the website randomized whether to display the number of buyers and/or sellers, and if so, how many buyers and/or sellers to claim. We find that when information about both buyers and sellers is displayed, a large number of sellers deters further seller listings. However, this deterrence effect disappears when only the number of sellers is presented. Similarly, a large number of buyers is more likely to attract new listings when it is displayed together with the number of sellers. These results suggest the presence of indirect network externalities, whereby a seller prefers markets with many other sellers because they help attract more buyers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0560","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of advertising user bases in two-sided exchange networks without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Analysis of the abnormal returns, however, reveals that the stock market response to these reports is shaped by omission bias, in that investors penalize commission violations more than omission violations. Furthermore, firm reputation is found to moderate the penalty for commission violations. In addition, two experiments examine the effect of such violations on investor beliefs. The first helps elucidate the process mechanism underlying the observed stock market effects and the second provides insights regarding the reputation-omission bias interaction for firms committing repeat violations.

The result thus begs the question as to why manufacturers of perishable commodities widely accept full returns of unsold stock as the norm. We model the environment as one where two capacity-constrained manufacturers compete for shelf space with the same retailer, and we show that a complete-credit returns policy is in fact the only possible equilibrium of the game. Our results obviate the need for knowing the exact functional form of the demand distribution in order to compute the returns credit, as Pasternack's results would require. From a retailer's standpoint, we establish a simple procurement strategy and show that it is optimal. The same game with price-only contracting has a pure-strategy equilibrium when the supplier capacities are below a threshold value and a mixed-strategy equilibrium when the supplier capacities cross this threshold but are still so limited that no single supplier can with certainty supply all the quantity demanded.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0563","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The top-selling items, which cumulatively make up 50% of sales, are sold at nearly every store, but other items are viewed as optional. We find that, within states, supermarkets owned by the same chain carry similar assortments and that the composition of their clientele and the presence of competing stores have effects on assortment similarity that are an order of magnitude smaller than ownership structure. In contrast, we find that, across states, supermarkets owned by the same chain do version their assortment. We explain this difference using extant work on the minimal efficient scale of supermarkets and on local demand effects. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution and role of regional brands. We find that regional brands are primarily distributed by small regional chains or independent stores. \u201cValue\u201d regional brands are primarily distributed by supermarket firms without store brands, whereas the distribution of \u201cpremium\u201d regional brands is unrelated to the presence of store brands.

Specifically, the last strategy becomes optimal when market growth rate is high enough. The results are similar when the price history is observed by consumers, except that no deviation from single-period profit maximization choices is optimal when market growth is low enough.

The tests rely on observations of the magnitudes and timings of the top two proxy bids, with the different tests stemming from different regularity assumptions about the underlying distribution of valuation signals. We apply the tests to data from three eBay markets\u2014MP3 players, DVDs, and used cars\u2014and we reject the sealed-bid abstraction in all three data sets. A closer examination of these rejections suggests that they are driven by less experienced bidders. This consistent rejection casts doubt on several existing theories of online auction behavior and suggests some demand estimates based on the abstraction can be biased. To assess the direction and magnitude of this bias, we propose and estimate a new model in which some bidders conform to the abstraction while other bidders bid in a reactive fashion. Because reactive bidding can be at least partially detected from the data, we are able to estimate the underlying distribution of demand and compare it to what the sealed-bid abstraction implies. We find that our proposed model fits the data better, and our demand estimates reveal a large potential downward bias were we to assume the second-price sealed-bid model instead.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0561","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical tests of auction models without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

To estimate the demand and search primitives, we introduce an optimal sequential search process into a model of choice and treat the observed market-level product search data as aggregations of individual-level optimal search sequences. The model builds on the dynamic programming framework by Weitzman [Weitzman, M. L. 1979. Optimal search for the best alternative. Econometrica47(3) 641\u2013654] and combines it with a choice model. It can accommodate highly complex demand patterns at the market level. At the individual level, the model has a number of attractive properties in estimation, including closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of alternative sets of searched goods and breaking the curse of dimensionality. Using numerical experiments, we verify the model's ability to identify the heterogeneous consumer tastes and search costs from product search data. Empirically, the model is applied to the online market for camcorders and is used to answer manufacturer questions about market structure and competition and to address policy-maker issues about the effect of selectively lowered search costs on consumer surplus outcomes. We demonstrate that the demand estimates from our search model predict the actual product sales ranks. We find that consumer search for camcorders at Amazon.com is typically limited to 10\u201315 choice options and that this affects estimates of own and cross elasticities. In a policy simulation, we also find that the vast majority of the households benefit from Amazon.com's product recommendations via lower search costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0574","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer search behavior and demand estimation without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The model allows managers to estimate cannibalization effects and calculate the new product's net demand, which may be considerably less than its total demand. We apply our methodology to the introduction of the Lexus RX300 using detailed car transaction data. This case is especially interesting because the Lexus RX300 was the first crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV), implying that its demand could come from both the luxury SUV and the luxury sedan categories.

We show that the seller can address unobservable buyer heterogeneity by inducing sales involving buyer uncertainty via two different mechanisms: (1) homogenizing heterogeneous consumers and (2) separating heterogeneous consumers. Offering advance sales encourages customers to purchase while they are uncertain about their consumption states (more homogeneous), but offering probabilistic goods encourages customers to reveal their heterogeneity via self-selecting whether or not to purchase the uncertain product. The relative attractiveness of these two selling strategies depends on the degree of two types of buyer heterogeneity: (1) Max_Value-Heterogeneity, which is the variation in consumers' valuations for their preferred good, and (2) Strength-Heterogeneity, which is the variation in the strength of consumers' preferences. Neither strategy is advantageous unless the market exhibits sufficient Max_Value-Heterogeneity. However, whereas Strength-Heterogeneity can destroy the profit advantage of advance selling, a mid-range of Strength-Heterogeneity is necessary for probabilistic selling to be advantageous.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0576","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on economic models related to buyer uncertainty and selling strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The seller faces two key decisions in designing such a mechanism. First, he must decide where in the process to collect the revenue\u2014that is, whether to commit to a minimum markup above cost (and thus define the bid-acceptance threshold given cost) and whether to set a fee for the consumer's right to bid. Second, the seller must decide whether to facilitate or hinder consumer learning about the current bid-acceptance threshold. We analyze these decisions for a profit-maximizing small intermediary retailer selling to consumers who can also purchase the product in an outside posted-price market. The optimal revenue model is to charge a fee for the right to bid and then accept all bids above cost, rather than to set a positive minimum markup above cost. Avoiding minimum markups in favor of a bidding fee is more profitable because of increased efficiency arising from more entry by consumers and higher bids by the entrants. When consumers learn about the bid-acceptance threshold before they enter the market, efficiency increases further, and generating revenue through a bidding fee can compensate the seller for his loss of information rent when the competition from the outside posted-price firm is relatively weak.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0577","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing mechanisms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is a costly issue for retailers and manufacturers\u2014in fact, it is estimated that the U.S. electronics industry alone spent $13.8 billion dollars in 2007 to restock returned products [Lawton, C. 2008. The war on returns. Wall Street Journal (May 8) D1]. The bulk of these returns were nondefective items that simply were not what the consumer wanted. To eliminate returns and to recoup the cost of handling returns, many retailers are adopting the practice of charging restocking fees to consumers as a penalty for making returns. This paper employs an analytical model of a bilateral monopoly to examine the impact of reverse channel structure on the equilibrium return policy and profit. More specifically, we examine how the return penalty is affected by whether returns are salvaged by the manufacturer or by the retailer. Interestingly, we find that the return penalty may be more severe when returns are salvaged by a channel member who derives greater value from a returned unit. Also, the manufacturer may earn greater profit by accepting returns even if the retailer has a more efficient outlet for salvaging units.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0578","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic implications of product returns and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These include (1) companies for whom transactions can only occur at fixed regular intervals, (2) firms that frequently associate transactions with specific events (e.g., a charity that records whether supporters respond to a particular appeal), and (3) organizations that choose to utilize discrete reporting periods even though the transactions can occur at any time. Furthermore, many of these businesses operate in a noncontractual setting, so they have a difficult time differentiating between those customers who have ended their relationship with the firm versus those who are in the midst of a long hiatus between transactions. We develop a model to predict future purchasing patterns for a customer base that can be described by these structural characteristics. Our beta-geometric/beta-Bernoulli (BG/BB) model captures both of the underlying behavioral processes (i.e., customers' purchasing while \u201calive\u201d and time until each customer permanently \u201cdies\u201d). The model is easy to implement in a standard spreadsheet environment and yields relatively simple closed-form expressions for the expected number of future transactions conditional on past observed behavior (and other quantities of managerial interest). We apply this discrete-time analog of the well-known Pareto/NBD model to a data set on donations made by the supporters of a nonprofit organization located in the midwestern United States.

Using a conditional order statistic model that relies on the joint distribution of the top two proxy bids of an auction, Zeithammer and Adams show that inexperienced bidders' reactive bidding is the main cause of the rejection of the sealed-bid abstraction. Their empirical study suggests that a large percentage of bidders reactively bid, and there is weak evolutionary pressure for bidders to converge to sealed bidding. We discuss theoretical implications of this rejection and the role of bidder experience, as well as inferences about bidder learning. Tracking an inexperienced bidder's bidding behavior over time, we show that bidders learn and their bidding strategy gravitates toward rational bidding. Potential biases in bidder experience measurement and bidder learning can be assessed using a cross-sectional, time-series data set that tracks a random sample of new eBay bidders. Learning speed is faster with their complete bidding history rather than feedback ratings or winning observations only. We highlight the importance of proper measures of bidder experience and its effect on bidding strategy evolutions, both of which play important roles in clarifying bidding behavior in online auctions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0581","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding behavior in online auctions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We propose that the discrepancy between an exchange partner's opportunistic behavior and the focal firm's expectations may create a state of incoherence and uncertainty and that this effect can be damaging to the exchange even when the partner's behavior is better than expected. Using nearly 500 longitudinal, confidential reports of industrial buyers and sellers, we find supportive evidence that (1) the net effect of the discrepancy is initially positive when behavior is better than expected but becomes rapidly negative thereafter, and (2) the net effect of the discrepancy is always negative when behavior is worse than expected. Thus, these effects will generally damage the exchange even as the partner tries to improve the relationship. This gives insight into why exchange relationships that hit a downward spiral can be difficult, if not impossible, to salvage. We also show that the dysfunctional consequences of discrepancy are mitigated through exchange structures such as the magnitude of dependence on an organizational partner, the development phase of the relationship, and the presence of bilateral idiosyncratic investments.

We study these effects in business-to-business electronic markets with firms competing in both upstream and downstream industries. The prior literature generally assumes that either the downstream firm (buyer) or the upstream firm (seller) is a monopoly. It is not clear whether information transparency would still create value if both buyers and sellers face oligopolistic competition, where the benefits of information transparency could be competed away. To answer this question, we first develop a simple two-echelon e-market model and then extend the model to more general settings. We find that information transparency can create value for the overall e-market, yet it affects buyers and sellers very differently: one side will be hurt, depending on the competition mode (Cournot or Bertrand) in the downstream. This suggests that a manufacturer-owned, a supplier-owned, and a neutral e-market will have different preferences for information transparency. Finally, we find that information transparency can hurt consumers when the downstream industry engages in Bertrand competition. This is a surprising result given the expectation that online markets create substantial value for consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0585","","MKS","Marketing","3","['information transparency', 'market participants', 'value']","The article discusses information transparency and its effects on market participants, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

The consistency of the authors' findings as well as the ability of their alternative explanation to account for all of their test results lends great support to their thesis. However, we think that several of their empirical tests examine ancillary assumptions about bidder behavior and do not test the bid = value assumption directly. Furthermore, although their reduced-form model incorporating \u201creactive\u201d bidders is a good first attempt at expanding the canonical framework, we worry that their counterfactual pricing analysis using the reactive model is suspect because the parameters they estimate are not structural.

Much of this price dispersion appears to be due to a lack of switching by bidders between auctions, which in turn could be due to inertia related to search costs. We identify some of the influencing factors through a controlled field experiment involving pairs of simultaneous auctions. Keeping the sellers and the goods sold identical between two auctions, we vary auction design features between and within pairs including shipping cost, open reserve, secret reserve price, and duration, and we provide bidders with incentives to search. We use a choice model that examines individual choice between pairs of simultaneous auctions. We find that within-pair price dispersion is substantial and that prices and auction choice by bidders are indeed related to search costs. We find strong inertia in auction choice and find that this effect significantly interacts with time left in the auction. Although individuals do not always choose a lower-priced auction, they are more likely to do so when search costs are low or search incentives are high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0601","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online auctions and price dispersion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a sample of retail banking customers observed over a 30-month period at a large U.S. bank, we test whether changes in service consumption, cost to serve, and customer profitability are associated with the adoption of online banking. We find that customer adoption of online banking is associated with (1) substitution, primarily from incrementally more costly self-service delivery channels (automated teller machine and voice response unit); (2) augmentation of service consumption in more costly service delivery channels (branch and call center); (3) a substantial increase in total transaction volume; (4) an increase in estimated average cost to serve resulting from the combination of points (1)\u2013(3); and (5) a reduction in short-term customer profitability. However, we find that use of the online banking channel is associated with higher customer retention rates over one-, two-, and three-year horizons.

Recent research has attempted to resolve this question by considering the variance of creative outcome distributions. It has implicitly assumed a symmetric thickening or thinning of both tails, i.e., that a greater probability of breakthroughs comes at the cost of a greater probability of failures. In contrast, we propose that collaboration can have opposite effects at the two extremes: it reduces the probability of very poor outcomes\u2014because of more rigorous selection processes\u2014while simultaneously increasing the probability of extremely successful outcomes\u2014because of greater recombinant opportunity in creative search. Analysis of over half a million patented inventions supports these arguments: Individuals working alone, especially those without affiliation to organizations, are less likely to achieve breakthroughs and more likely to invent particularly poor outcomes. Quantile regressions demonstrate that the effect is more than an upward mean shift. We find partial mediation of the effect of collaboration on extreme outcomes by the diversity of technical experience of team members and by the size of team members' external collaboration networks. Supporting our meta-argument for the importance of examining each tail of the distribution separately, experience diversity helps trim poor outcomes significantly more than it helps create breakthroughs, relative to the effect of external networks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1072","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['collaboration', 'diversity', 'breakthroughs']","The article discusses the importance of collaboration and diversity in achieving successful outcomes, which aligns with moderate woke themes of teamwork and diverse experiences.

Since August of 1997, when the Food and Drug Administration eased the restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), there has been a dramatic increase in the use of DTCA by pharmaceutical firms to target end customers (patients). DTCA seems to have two different effects on pharmaceutical markets. The first is to inform patients about the availability of drugs for some ailments, thus expanding the market (constructive). The second is to persuade patients to talk about specific brands when they meet physicians, with the objective of influencing market share (combative). We consider both effects of DTCA in the presence of a detailing program in a competitive environment. We incorporate the dynamics of physician-patient interaction in a game-theoretic model where firms decide on the form of DTCA to adopt (constructive or combative) and then compete in the marketplace by choosing detailing and DTCA levels. We answer four questions: What is the impact of adopting DTCA on competitive intensity? How do optimal detailing levels for a firm change with the adoption of DTCA? How should the DTCA strategy for a firm vary depending on whether it is stronger or weaker in its degree of influence in the physician's office? Finally, under what conditions would competing firms voluntarily decide to pursue constructive DTCA?","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1074","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['advertising', 'patients', 'market share']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of advertising strategies in the pharmaceutical industry without addressing social justice, ethical concerns, or issues of equity.

The firm sets a price before demand uncertainty is resolved. Speculators may enter the market purely with the intention of resale, which can be profitable if demand turns out to be high. Consumers may strategically choose when to purchase, and they may also choose to purchase from the firm or from the speculators. We characterize equilibrium prices and profits and analyze the long-run capacity decisions of the firm. There are three major findings. First, the presence of speculators increases the firm's expected profits even though the resale market competes with the firm. Second, by facilitating resale, the firm can mimic dynamic pricing outcomes and enjoy the associated benefits while charging a fixed price. Third, speculative behavior may generate incentives for the seller to artificially restrict supply, and thus may lead to lower capacity investments.

To date, the economic value of products self-designed using mass customization (MC) toolkits has been attributed to the two factors of preference fit achieved (which should be as high as possible) and design effort (which should be as low as possible). On the basis of literature on behavioral decision making, we suggest a third factor, namely the awareness of being the creator of the product design. In the course of five different studies, we provide experimental evidence that this \u201cI designed it myself\u201d effect creates economic value for the customer. Regardless of the two other factors, self-designed products generate a significantly higher willingness to pay. This effect is mediated by feelings of accomplishment and moderated by the outcome of the process as well as the individual's perceived contribution to the self-design process. These findings have important implications for MC companies: It is not enough merely to design MC toolkits in such a way that preference fit is maximized and design effort is minimized. To capture the full value of MC, toolkits should also elicit \u201cI designed it myself\u201d feelings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1077","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['self-designed', 'economic value', 'individual products']","The article focuses on the economic implications of mass customization and individual product design without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Norm enforcement through peer punishment has been shown to be effective in raising contributions by itself. We test whether and how (centrally provided) private incentives interact with (decentralized) punishment, both of which affect subjects' monetary payoffs. The results of our experiment show that private incentives for contributors can reduce the effectiveness of the norm enforcement mechanism: Free riders are punished less harshly in the treatment with incentives, and as a consequence, average contributions to the public good are no higher than without incentives.

However, bonus plans typically pay for performance relative to a goal, and the manager whose performance is to be evaluated often participates in setting the goal. In these settings, PFP affects managers' incentive to influence goal levels in addition to affecting performance effort. Prior field research is silent on the effect of PFP on goals, the focus of this paper. Using sales and sales goal data from 61 stores of a U.S. retail firm over 10 quarters, we find that the introduction of a performance-based bonus plan with participative goal setting is accompanied by lower goals that are more accurate predictors of subsequent sales performance. Statistical tests indicate that increased goal accuracy is attributable to managers \u201cmeeting but not beating\u201d goals and to new information being impounded in goals. We further investigate how differences among managers are associated with goal levels. We find significant \u201cmanager effects\u201d but no \u201csupervisor effects.\u201d In additional tests we find that cross-sectional differences among managers are related to differing marginal returns to slack-building effort. Turning to the role of new information on goals, we find that prior period performance has incremental power to explain goal levels in the postplan period. Our results provide field-based evidence that PFP and participative goal setting affect the level and accuracy of goals, effects that are associated with both information exchange and with managers' incentives to influence goals.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1088","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['participative', 'goals', 'performance']","The article discusses participative goal setting, which hints at inclusive practices in management, but the primary focus remains on performance metrics and incentive structures without a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes."],["2010","56","1","G\u00e9rard P.

This paper argues that another way of coping with the uncertainty, risk-constrained methods that have been ignored in existing literatures, could be more practicable (at least as a supplement) for decision support. With a simplified model, this paper explores technology development paths generated by two risk-constrained methods, and compares the two risk-constrained methods with a risk-factor method. Our study shows that comparing with the risk-factor method, the two risk-constrained methods also generate an S-shaped technology diffusion pattern, which accords with historical observations, and they can result in earlier as well as later adoption of an advanced but currently expensive technology, depending on different combinations of uncertainty levels of the technology learning rate and the upper limit on the expected risk cost. Another finding of our research is that two totally different technology development paths can both be optimal solutions, which implies that with early policy interventions there is the possibility that an economy could be led to a low-carbon economy with little additional cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1098","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['low-carbon economy', 'policy interventions', 'uncertainty']","The article discusses the potential for early policy interventions to lead to a low-carbon economy, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and societal impact, which aligns with woke themes.

We consider a firm that has access to a responsive nearshore source (e.g., Mexico) and a low-cost offshore source (e.g., China). The firm must determine an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand over time. Unfortunately, the optimal policy is too complex to allow a direct answer to our key question. Therefore, we analyze a tailored base-surge (TBS) sourcing policy that is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic trade-off between cost and responsiveness. The TBS policy combines push and pull controls by replenishing at a constant rate from the offshore source and producing at the nearshore plant only when inventory is below a target. The constant base allocation allows the offshore facility to focus on cost efficiency, whereas the nearshore facility's quick response capability is utilized only dynamically to guarantee high service. The research goals are to (i) determine the allocation of random demand into base and surge capacity, (ii) estimate corresponding working capital requirements, and (iii) identify and value the key drivers of dual sourcing. We present performance bounds on the optimal cost and prove that economic optimization brings the system into heavy traffic. We analyze the sourcing policy that is asymptotically optimal for high-volume systems and present a simple \u201csquare-root\u201d formula that is insightful to answer our questions and sufficiently accurate for practice, as is demonstrated with a validation study.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1099","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sourcing strategy and inventory management without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

When the product is highly perishable, retailers are biased toward excessive price competition and inadequate inventories.

We establish a simple and intuitive relationship between the incoming load (measured in Erlangs) and the extent of uncertainty in arrival rates (measured via the coefficient of variation) that characterizes the extent to which uncertainty dominates stochastic variability or vice versa.

In successive generalizations, we allow the vendor to offer a fixed level of personalization, variable levels of personalization, and monetary transfers (coupons) to the consumers that depend on the level of personalization chosen. We show that a vendor offering a fixed level of personalization does not offer a coupon unless his marginal value of information (MVI) is sufficiently high, and even when personalization is costless, the vendor does not cover the market. Under a fixed services offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing. Next, we demonstrate that in the absence of couponing, the vendor's optimal variable personalization services contract maximizes surplus for all heterogeneous consumers, which is in contrast to standard results from monopolistic screening. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary according to personalization levels, the optimal contract is not fully revealing unless his MVI is high and he will not offer coupons when this MVI is low. However, a vendor with a moderate MVI (between certain thresholds) offers a bunched contract, wherein consumers with low privacy concerns receive a variable services-coupon contract, those with moderate privacy concerns receive a fixed services-coupon contract, and those with high privacy concerns do not participate in the market. The coupon value is decreasing in privacy sensitivity of consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1210","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['privacy', 'personalization', 'consumer', 'concerns']","The article discusses privacy concerns related to online personalization services, indicating a moderate focus on ethical implications in consumer behavior.

A category captain may perform demand-enhancing services such as better shelf arrangements, shelf-space management, and design and management of in-store displays. In this paper, we examine when and why a retailer may engage one manufacturer exclusively as a category captain to provide such service and the implications. We find that demand substitutability of competing brands gives rise to a service efficiency effect\u2014service that expands the category is more effective in increasing a manufacturer's sales and margin than service that shifts demand from a rival's brand. We show that the service efficiency effect may motivate a category captain to provide a service that benefits all brands in the category even though doing so is more costly. We further show that, in categories that are less price competitive, there is higher competition between manufacturers to become the category captain. Consequently, a retailer may obtain better service by using a category captain than by engaging both manufacturers simultaneously. Our findings may help explain why a retailer may rely on a category captain despite concerns regarding opportunism and why there is limited empirical evidence of harm to rival manufacturers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1211","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail management and category strategy without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If so, does the CEO make a difference to company performance? Examining CEO departures over the decade from 1992 to 2002, the authors find that CEO pay does reflect CEO ability when one considers the market for CEOs. The departing CEO's subsequent labor market success is greater if the firm's predeparture performance is better, the prior pay is higher, and the stock market's reaction is more negative on the departed company's stock price. CEOs can often earn comparably in the market with subsequent employment, but that does not imply that the CEO salary is worth the cost to the company. Do CEOs really matter to firm profitability? The authors find that the stock price reaction upon CEO departure is negatively related to the firm's prior performance and to the CEO's prior pay, indicating that the CEO really matters. Collectively, the authors' results reject the view that differences in firm performance stem entirely from non-CEO factors such as the firm's assets, other employees, or \u201cluck,\u201d and that CEO pay is unrelated to the CEO's contribution to firm value. The insight for management: The CEO's pay is often justifiable with respect to the market for CEOs and when the CEO's influence on company performance is considered.Predicting the Next Big Thing: Success as a Signal of Poor Judgment (p. 1653) Jerker Denrell, Christina Fang It's been said that it's better to be lucky than to be good. Is that the case with stock prognosticators who have correctly made a long-shot stock prediction? Certainly, successfully predicting that a stock will become a big hit seems impressive. Managers and entrepreneurs who have made successful predictions and have invested money on this basis are promoted, become rich, and may end up on the cover of business magazines. In both lab experiments and field data on professional forecasts from the Wall Street Journal Survey of Economic Forecasts, the authors show that an accurate prediction about such an extreme and unlikely event may in fact be an indication of poor rather than good forecasting ability. The insight for management: Pay for a sound approach, not for results. Bide your time before promoting superstar stock pickers\u2014their performance may not be indicative of their ability and may not be sustainable.Capacity Sizing Under Parameter Uncertainty: Safety Staffing Principles Revisited (p. 1668) Achal Bassamboo, Ramandeep S. Randhawa, Assaf Zeevi How many live telephone operators should be scheduled to provide high-quality service at a low cost? The long-held \u201csquare-root rule\u201d suggests that it is best to staff for the mean call volume and duration, plus a factor of the square root of their ratio to cover for the stochastic variability of call arrival patterns and call durations. However, the square-root rule assumes that the mean call volume and duration are known; the authors consider the case in which the mean arrival rate of work is random. The authors establish a simple and intuitive relationship between the incoming load and the extent of uncertainty in arrival rates that characterizes the extent to which mean uncertainty dominates stochastic variability or vice versa. The insight for management: The \u201csquare-root rule\u201d accommodates random variation around a known mean, but, in the case of highly uncertain mean call volume and duration projections, new rules must be adopted to achieve high-quality service at low cost.An Experimental Test of Advice and Social Learning (p. 1687) Bo\u011fa\u00e7han \u00c7elen, Shachar Kariv, Andrew Schotter Do actions really speak louder than words? \u201cSocial learning\u201d describes any situation in which individuals learn by observing the behavior of others.

Despite the informational equivalence of advice and actions, the authors find that subjects in a laboratory social-learning situation appear to be more willing to follow the advice given to them by their predecessor than to copy their action and that the presence of advice increases subjects' welfare. The insight for management: Words of advice might carry more weight among trainees than providing a good example.Seller Search and Market Outcomes in Online Auctions (p. 1702)  Jason Kuruzovich, Siva Viswanathan, Ritu Agarwal It has become widely accepted that information technology (IT) has had a profound influence on market transactions, with lower search costs for buyers often considered the key to lower prices and higher consumer welfare. But is the reverse true? Sellers also use online channels to search for buyers whose product preferences and valuations match the sellers' offerings. The authors tracked thousands of experienced sellers in tens of thousands of online auctions for used vehicles. They find that the mean price and price dispersion, duration of search, and search on other websites are each associated with a higher final sale price. The insight for management: Sustained seller effort in finding the right buyer can pay off with a higher sales price.Culture Clash: The Costs and Benefits of Homogeneity (p. 1718) Eric Van den Steen The merger of two dissimilar companies can result in \u201cculture clash\u201d and disharmonious, counterproductive behavior between the two merged firms. The author develops an economic theory of the costs and benefits of a homogeneous corporate culture in the sense of shared beliefs and values. The author's analysis confirms that harmony among merged companies can create efficiency; shared beliefs lead to more delegation, less monitoring, higher satisfaction, higher motivation, faster coordination, less time in internal negotiations, and more communication\u2014in short, a smooth merger due to shared beliefs. However, a merger of like firms can lead to less experimentation and less information collection. In the long run this could lead to a reduced ability to evolve and change with the environment. The insight for management: Culture clash may be costly and frustrating in the short run but, carefully managed, can allow the organization to avoid the pitfalls of \u201cgroup think,\u201d making it better able to critically evaluate the business environment from multiple perspectives.The Competitive Consequences of Using a Category Captain (p. 1739) Upender Subramanian, Jagmohan S. Raju, Sanjay K. Dhar, Yusong Wang Should Kellogg's determine grocer shelf design and display for Post and General Mills? Many retailers designate one national brand manufacturer in each product category as a \u201ccategory captain\u201d to help manage the entire category. The authors examine when and why a retailer may engage one manufacturer exclusively to provide such service. They find that service that expands the category is more effective in increasing the category captain's sales and margin than service that shifts demand from a rival's brand. Because of this, a category captain might be motivated to provide a service that benefits all brands in the category even though doing so is more costly. In categories that are less price competitive, the authors find higher competition between manufacturers to become the category captain, and, consequently, a retailer may obtain better service by using a category captain exclusively than by engaging both manufacturers simultaneously. The insight for management: Despite concerns regarding category captain opportunism, a retailer may rely exclusively on one manufacturer with limited empirical evidence of harm to rival manufacturers.Mechanism Design for \u201cFree\u201d but \u201cNo Free Disposal\u201d Services: The Economics of Personalization Under Privacy Concerns (p. 1766) Ramnath K. Chellappa, Shivendu Shivendu It might seem ideal to receive a coupon for cereal on your smart phone as you walk down the cereal aisle. Or is it? It might be discomforting to a shopper that someone, somewhere, is tracking their movements. Similarly, is it helpful to receive a discount for a weight loss program just after sending an e-mail about exercise? Despite the convenience and timeliness, consumers do not always prefer more services to fewer if personalization might jeopardize their privacy. How much information is a consumer willing to provide to get augmented service? The authors examine vendor strategies in a market where consumers have mixed concerns about privacy. First, they find that a vendor offering a fixed level of personalization does not cover the market. Second, under a fixed services offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary according to personalization levels, when the value of that personal information is high, higher-value coupons should be offered; conversely, the vendor will not offer coupons when the value of information is low. The insight for management: Offering variable services and coupons helps to better serve consumers who opt in and will more fully serve a market of consumers with varying privacy concerns if the value of incremental information justifies the cost of the incremental discounts or service.Investor Inattention and the Market Reaction to Merger Announcements (p. 1781) Henock Louis, Amy Sun Can an investor follow every earnings announcement of companies in which stock is held? No, it is well known that investors cannot reasonably keep up with every event occurring in their stock holdings. But one would think that large corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions would always attract investor attention. The authors find evidence indicating that inattention affects investors' information processing even in the context of merger announcements. They find further that the market reaction to Friday stock swap announcements is muted; there results lower abnormal trading volumes and less-pronounced abnormal stock returns. The insight for management: To encourage spikes in trading levels and price swings on the news of a merger, avoid Friday announcements; conversely, for less dramatic swings, announce on a Friday.Expectation and Chance-Constrained Models and Algorithms for Insuring Critical Paths (p. 1794) Siqian Shen, J. Cole Smith, Shabbir Ahmed Managing the critical path to an on-time completion date is essential to effective project management. If the cost of failure is high and many of the uncertainties in the project are outside the planner's control, is there a cost-effective way to protect the project from this uncertainty? Which tasks should be bolstered with \u201cinsurance\u201d resources, and how much buffering is appropriate? The authors analyze a problem in which task finishing times are uncertain but can be insured beforehand to mitigate potential delays. A decision maker must trade off costs incurred in insuring arcs with expected penalties associated with late project completion times. The authors show for a number of different late penalty functions that their optimization approach can be quickly solved. The insight for management: Optimization techniques can help determine optimal strategies for hedging against late project completion.Capturing Consumption Flexibility in Assortment Choice from Scanner Panel Data (p. 1815) Liang Guo If a consumer bought blueberry yogurt last week, are they more or less likely to buy strawberry yogurt this week? The author develops and estimates a model to empirically identify consumption flexibility across similar choices in a product category and across time. The author allows for a consumer's consumption utility to be dependent on recent purchases. Moreover, consumers' purchase and consumption decisions are modeled at two distinctive and sequentially related stages, which allows for incorporating the effect of consumption flexibility. The author finds that recent purchases in the same category do affect subsequent purchase decisions. The insight for management: Effective cross-product promotions (such as coupons at checkout) should consider the complementarity and substitutability of recent purchases in the same category.Nested Simulation in Portfolio Risk Measurement (p. 1833) Michael B. Gordy, Sandeep Juneja In finance, risk is assessed and purchase decisions are made. As events unfold, the portfolio assets valuations are realized and risk is reassessed for future periods. Research in this area is based on \u201cnested simulation,\u201d but practitioners may perceive the computational burden of such nested schemes to be unacceptable and adopt a variety of second-best pricing techniques to avoid the inner simulation. The authors question whether such shortcuts are necessary. They show that a relatively small number of trials can yield accurate estimates and minimize the mean square error of the resultant risk estimate with little computational effort. The insight for management: Better risk and valuation estimates are within reach with reasonable computational effort.Open Platform Strategies and Innovation: Granting Access vs. Devolving Control (p. 1849) Kevin Boudreau Whether or not to open a new technology is one of the most crucial decisions an innovator will face. One approach is to grant access to a platform and thereby open up markets for complementary components around the platform. Another approach is to give up control over the platform itself. Opening has the potential to build momentum behind a technology but could leave its creator with little control or ability to appropriate value. The author studies these two fundamentally distinct approaches to opening a technology platform and their different impacts on innovation. Based on data on 21 handheld computing systems between 1990 and 2004, the author finds that granting greater levels of access to independent hardware developer firms produces up to a fivefold acceleration in the rate of new handheld device development, but the marginal effect of relinquishing control of the platform adds only 20% to the rate of innovation. The insight for management: Open access to a technology platform has a big effect on innovation; however, relinquishing control results in a relatively small marginal increase in innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1263","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['CEO compensation', 'performance', 'market']","The article primarily focuses on CEO compensation and its relation to firm performance, lacking significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We give several applications. For empirical purposes, we can measure discount functions without requiring any measurement of or assumption about utility. We can quantitatively measure time inconsistencies and simplify their qualitative tests. TTO sequences can be administered and analyzed very easily, using only pencil and paper. For theoretical purposes, we use TTO sequences to axiomatize (quasi-)hyperbolic discount functions. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring TTO sequences in an experiment, in which we tested the axiomatizations.

Our work complements and contributes to the existing literature by exploring the possible effect of another economic lever\u2014product bundling\u2014on the relationship governing piracy and seller profits. The traditional economic rationale of demand pooling from bundling that enables sellers to extract higher surplus and its particular attractiveness for information goods with negligible marginal and bundling costs carry over to our analysis. However, the presence of piracy injects several new facets to our analysis. Bundling creates a shared level of piracy of disparate products, and under certain conditions to the detriment of one of the products. We argue that by construction of the copyright laws, the act of bundling itself can have a deterrence effect. This deterrence effect, along with shared piracy of products and demand pooling are ingredients that together dictate the overall piracy, pricing, profit, and welfare outcomes. Our analysis reveals several interesting insights. Bundling can be profitable even when the very act of bundling increases the piracy level of one of the products in the bundle. Termed phantom piracy, this represents a situation where sellers trade off higher piracy for one product in favor of lower piracy for the other product while deriving overall higher profits. Extensive simulation analysis shows that the region of phantom piracy is vastly expanded when additional products are introduced to the bundle. Conversely, under certain conditions, a profit maximizing seller opts not to bundle even when bundling can serve to lower the overall level of piracy. Price discounts that are typically offered by bundling are sharply deepened when piracy enters the equation. When piracy is a phenomenon to contend with, product bundling always increases consumer surplus even in scenarios where the seller may not realize higher profits. Unlike other forms of price discrimination that are often viewed by consumers with a jaundiced eye as they attempt to extract additional surplus from the consumers, product bundling in the software context can be a win-win scenario for both the buyers and the sellers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1221","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on economic strategies related to software piracy and profitability without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

After showing the inadequacy of the principal component analysis approach, which is commonly used in the literature, we adopt a nonparametric regression technique with nonlinear principal components extracted from the implied volatilities of various moneyness and maturities as proxies for the transformed state variables. The methodology is applied to the prices of S&P 500 index options from the period 1996\u20132005. We find that, in addition to the index value itself, two state variables, approximated by the first two nonlinear principal components, are adequate for pricing the index options and fitting the data in both time series and cross sections.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1222","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical issue related to options pricing without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Yet, despite its importance, there has been little empirical research on the timing of acquisition decisions in high-technology environments. Should organizations wait until more information is available about the target and its markets so that a better valuation can be obtained? Or should the target be acquired early to lower acquisition cost and gain early access to key technologies? Applying an event study methodology to technology acquisitions in the telecommunications industry from 1995 to 2001, we find evidence that supports acquiring early in the face of uncertainty. Our analytical model and empirical analysis uncover two characteristics of young targets that drive benefits from early acquisitions\u2014flexible growth options that provide greater opportunities for synergistic fit, and greater valuation uncertainty that leads to lower prices. However, the negative effect of target age on acquirer value is partially mitigated if the target has recent patents or is privately held. In addition, the probability of acquisition is higher for targets that have signals of higher quality, and lower for targets that have superior access to capital and resources.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1223","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical research related to technology acquisition and valuation in high-technology industries, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The theory rests on a well-known stylized fact of human behavior: people's preferences are reference dependent. We incorporate reference dependence into the newsvendor framework by assuming that there are psychological costs of leftovers and stockouts. We also hypothesize that the psychological aversion to leftovers is greater than the disutility for stockouts. We then experimentally test the proposed theory in both the centralized and decentralized inventory structures using subjects motivated by substantial financial incentives. Consistent with the proposed theory, actual orders exhibit the so-called \u201cpull-to-center\u201d bias and the degree of bias is greater in the high-profit margin than in the low-profit margin condition. These systematic biases are shown to eliminate the risk-pooling benefit when the demands across store locations are strongly correlated. Because the proposed model nests the standard inventory and ex post inventory error minimization theories as special cases, one can systematically evaluate the predictive power of each alternative using the generalized likelihood principle. We structurally estimate all three theories using the experimental data, and the estimation results strongly suggest that the proposed behavioral theory captures actual orders and profits better. We also conduct two experiments to validate the behavioral model by manipulating the relative salience of the psychological costs of leftovers versus that of stockouts to alleviate the pull-to-center bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1225","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral theories related to inventory management and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We match technology usage data to sales data, controlling for consumers' historical purchasing behavior. Our unique data set allows us to reveal the relationship between technology usage and online sales. Our analyses show that consumers' information technology usage has a significant effect on the sales to them, but this effect varies for different technologies and across different products. In particular, the use of directed search has a positive effect on the sales of promoted products, whereas it has a negative effect on the sales of nonpromoted products.

If the ensuing shock is sufficiently large, the nonmyopic investor unwinds positions more than immediately necessary and, all else being equal, prefers to retain more of the assets with low temporary price impact in order to hedge against possible distress.

Debo, Alan Scheller-Wolf, Stephen F. Smith How can phone-in diagnostic service centers improve service and reduce costs in health care? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of an estimated 113.9 million emergency room visits during 2003, 13% were nonurgent. At an estimated average cost of $300 per emergency room visit, a cost of $4.4 billion can be managed more efficiently by directing patients to the appropriate care center. To help with this problem, diagnostic service centers provide advice to patients over the phone about what the most appropriate course of action is based on their symptoms. Managers of such centers must strike a balance among accuracy of advice, callers' waiting time, and staffing costs by setting the appropriate staffing levels, skills sets, and service depth. Patients decide whether to use such a diagnostic based on their expectation of accuracy of advice and wait time due to call congestion. The authors find that the dual concerns of accuracy and congestion lead to a counterintuitive impact of capacity: Increasing capacity might increase congestion. The insight for management: Staffing, quality, and depth of service considerations require careful consideration in health care.Reference Dependence in Multilocation Newsvendor Models: A Structural Analysis (p. 1891) Teck-Hua Ho, Noah Lim, Tony Haitao Cui How many newspapers should a newsvendor stock, given that demand each day is uncertain? On one hand, the newsvendor likes to stock enough to provide a high service level. On the other hand, overstocking newspapers will lead to wasteful excess inventory. Researchers have found that there are psychological costs of leftovers and stockouts, tending to result in a \u201cpull-to-center\u201d bias. The authors confirm this result and further find that the psychological aversion to leftovers is greater than the disutility for stockouts; the pull-to-center is greater from the right. They test their hypothesis with both the centralized and decentralized inventory structures using experimental subjects motivated by substantial financial incentives. They find that the degree of bias is greater in the high-profit margin than in the low-profit margin condition, which is counterintuitive, given that with high profit margins there is greater economic incentive to overstock and have leftovers. The insight for management: Managers may exhibit a bias toward stocking for the mean demand, which may inhibit their ability to achieve a level that optimally balances its costs and benefits.Manipulation Robustness of Collaborative Filtering (p. 1911) Benjamin Van Roy, Xiang Yan Netflix, Amazon, and the like allow customers to get recommendations from other customers with similar tastes through a \u201ccollaborative filtering system.\u201d Perhaps because of their success, collaborative filtering systems influence purchase decisions and hence have become targets of manipulation by unscrupulous vendors. The authors demonstrate that the algorithms used in these services are highly susceptible to manipulation and introduce new collaborative filtering algorithms that help to reduce this unwanted tampering. The insight for management: Providing a service like a collaborative filtering system is an advantage for customers only if they can trust its content; advanced methods may help to better prevent misleading information.Technology Usage and Online Sales: An Empirical Study (p. 1930) Prabuddha De, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, Mohammad S.

In contrast, the use of a recommendation system has a positive effect on the sales of both promoted and nonpromoted products.

Gopal, Alok Gupta Approximately $50 billion per year are lost to software piracy, which is widely regarded as one of the biggest problems facing the software industry. As a result, the industry has adopted a number of technical, legal, and economic strategies to curb piracy and stem the resulting losses. At the same time, the software industry has made increasing use of product bundling, which enables sellers to extract higher profits from buyers. The authors find that the practice of product bundling can increase the presence of piracy but that, despite this, bundling can be profitable even when the act of bundling increases the piracy level of one of the products in the bundle. With such \u201cphantom piracy,\u201d sellers trade higher piracy for one product in favor of lower piracy for the other product while deriving overall higher profits. The use of price discounting of bundles deters piracy. The insight for management: Bundling coupled with steep price discounts can be an effective deterrent to piracy, while consumers also benefit from higher surplus.Optimal Bundling Strategies Under Heavy-Tailed Valuations (p. 1963) Rustam Ibragimov, Johan Walden The authors develop a framework for the optimal bundling problem of a seller who provides goods to consumers who value the products differently. When there are \u201cheavy tails\u201d\u2014an exceptionally high number of customers who assign extreme valuations to the products\u2014buyers prefer unbundled products. For products with low marginal costs, the seller's optimal strategy is consistent with consumer preferences: to provide goods separately when consumers' valuations are heavy tailed and in a single bundle when valuations are thin tailed. These conclusions are reversed for goods with high marginal costs. The insight for management: Seller and buyer bundling preferences can diverge as the cost structure of the product increases.Prediction Markets: Alternative Mechanisms for Complex Environments with Few Traders (p. 1977) Paul J.

The authors find that when information is complex, an iterated poll (or Delphi method) outperforms the double auction mechanism. The insight for management: More traditional forecasting methods may be more appropriate in small-scale situations with complex information.Optimal Portfolio Liquidation with Distress Risk (p. 1997) David B. Brown, Bruce Ian Carlin, Miguel Sousa Lobo How should large holders of equities liquidate large holdings? The authors analyze the problem of an investor who needs to unwind a portfolio in the face of recurring and uncertain liquidity needs while accounting for both permanent and temporary price impacts of their trading. They show that a risk-neutral investor who myopically deleverages his position to meet an immediate need for cash always prefers to sell more liquid assets. But if the investor faces the possibility of a sizable downstream shock, the nonmyopic investor unwinds positions more quickly and retains more of the assets with low temporary price impact in order to hedge against possible distress. Generally, optimal liquidation involves selling more of the assets with a more temporary and less permanent impact, even if these assets are relatively illiquid. The insight for management: Properly accounting for the possibility of future shocks should play a role in liquidating large positions in portfolios.Time-Tradeoff Sequences for Analyzing Discounting and Time Inconsistency (p. 2015) Arthur E. Attema, Han Bleichrodt, Kirsten I. M. Rohde, Peter P. Wakker Are preferences dependent on the passage of time? The authors develop a general tool to analyze intertemporal choice. The authors suggest that currently popular discount functions used in the literature do not account well for this possibility and suggest new measures that do. The insight for management: To appropriately model consumer choice, it may be advisable to reconsider intertemporal effects in consumer choice. Conditional Coskewness in Stock and Bond Markets: Time-Series Evidence (p. 2031) Jian Yang, Yinggang Zhou, Zijun Wang How are risks of stock related to the returns of bonds, and vice versa? Coskewness is the return of one asset relative to the volatility of the other. The authors evaluate U.S. stock coskewness (the relation between stock return and bond volatility) and bond coskewness (the relation between bond return and stock volatility). They find that the relationship is statistically and economically significant and confirm these results with data from the United Kingdom. The insight for management: When evaluating risk and reward of portfolios, coskewness might be a factor to consider.Modifying the Mean-Variance Approach to Avoid Violations of Stochastic Dominance (p. 2050) Pavlo R. Blavatskyy The Nobel-Prize-winning work of Dr. Harry Markowitz in the 1950s on portfolio theory proposes a mean-variance approach to balancing risk and return from a portfolio. The risk measure used, variance, although popular, is unduly subject to outlier observations because errors are squared. The author proposes \u201cmean absolute semideviation,\u201d which weights errors linearly rather than quadratically. The insight for management: Improved risk measures may lead to recommended optimal portfolio strategies that do not exhibit behavioral irregularities.On the Number of State Variables in Options Pricing (p. 2058) Gang Li, Chu Zhang How should options prices be modeled? The authors investigate the methodological issue of determining the number of state variables required for options pricing. They propose a nonparametric regression technique based on the \u201cmoneyness\u201d of the option (the probability of a position having a positive economic value at maturity) and the time to maturity. The methodology is applied to the prices of S&P 500 index options from the period 1996\u20132005. They find that two state variables based on two nonlinear principal components are adequate for pricing the index options and fitting the data in both time series and cross sections. The insight for management: Option pricing errors can be reduced through improved choice on the state variables chosen.Target Age and the Acquisition of Innovation in High-Technology Industries (p. 2076) Sam Ransbotham, Sabyasachi Mitra When should mature technology companies like Microsoft acquire entrepreneurial firms with innovative products? Should organizations wait until more information is available about the target and its markets so that a better valuation can be obtained, or should the target be acquired early to lower acquisition cost and gain early access to key technologies? External acquisition of new technology is a growing trend in the innovation and product development process as firms complement internal research and development efforts with aggressive acquisition programs. In a study of the telecommunications industry from 1995 to 2001, the authors find evidence that supports acquiring early in the face of uncertainty. The insights for management: Early acquisition of innovative technologies may provide more flexible growth options that provide greater opportunities for synergistic fit, and greater valuation uncertainty of young companies may lead to a lower acquisition price.Network-Independent Partner Selection and the Evolution of Innovation Networks (p. 2094) Joel A. C. Baum, Robin Cowan, Nicolas Jonard How do firms select strategic alliances? Most research on strategic alliances has focused on the idea that partners are selected on the basis of social capital considerations; firms tend to build on existing relationships.

The Impact of Manufacturing Offshore on Technology Competitiveness in the Optoelectronics Industry","This paper presents a case study of the impact of manufacturing offshore on technology competitiveness in the optoelectronics industry. It examines a critical design/facility location decision being faced by optoelectronic component manufacturers. This paper uses a combination of simulation modeling and empirical data to demonstrate the economic constraints facing these firms. The results show that production location changes the relative production economics of the two competing designs\u2014one emerging, one prevailing\u2014that are currently perfect substitutes for each other on the telecom market, but not necessarily perfect substitutes in other markets in the long term. Specifically, if optoelectronic component firms shift production from the United States to countries in developing East Asia, the emerging designs that were developed in the United States no longer pay. Production characteristics are different abroad, and the prevailing design can be more cost effective in developing country production environments. The emerging designs, however, have performance characteristics that may be valuable in the long term to the larger computing market and to pushing forward Moore's law. This paper concludes by exploring the dilemma this creates for the optoelectronic component manufacturers and recommending a framework based on which the results may be generalized to other industries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1227","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['offshore', 'developing countries', 'economic constraints']","The article discusses the implications of offshore manufacturing, particularly in developing countries, which touches on economic and ethical considerations.

Our analysis of the integrated system suggests that the base stock list price policy fails to achieve optimality even under deterministic demand. Instead, the optimal policy is characterized by two critical values: a reorder point and a target safety stock. Under this policy, a positive order is issued if and only if the inventory level is below the reorder point. When this happens, the optimal order and price are coordinated to achieve a constant target safety stock, which aims at hedging the demand uncertainty. We further investigate the profit improvement obtained from deploying dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing. Our results indicate that either supply limit or supply uncertainty may induce a significant benefit from dynamic pricing, and the compound effect of supply limit and uncertainty can be much more pronounced than the individual effects. Whether or not the supply capacity is limited has a major implication on the value of dynamic pricing. Under unlimited supply, dynamic pricing is more valuable when procurement cost is high or when demand is more sensitive to price. With limited supply, however, the capacity restriction tends to be relaxed, reducing the value of dynamic pricing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1238","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, innovative performance in firms should also depend heavily on the pecuniary and nonpecuniary motives of the employees actually working in research and development. Using data on more than 1,700 Ph.D. scientists and engineers, we examine the relationships between individuals' motives (e.g., desire for intellectual challenge, income, or responsibility) and their innovative performance. We find that motives matter, but different motives have very different effects: Motives regarding intellectual challenge, independence, and money have a strong positive relationship with innovative output, whereas motives regarding job security and responsibility tend to have a negative relationship. We also explore possible mechanisms underlying the observed relationships between motives and performance. Although hours worked (quantity of effort) have a strong positive effect on performance, motives appear to affect innovative performance primarily via other dimensions of effort (character of effort).

In an environment where all customers agree that one of the two components is of higher quality than the other and that the bundle is of the highest quality, we derive the seller's optimal bundling strategy. We demonstrate that the optimal solution depends on the absolute and relative availabilities of the two resources as well as upon the extent of subadditivity of the quality of the products. The possible strategies that can arise as equilibrium behavior include a pure components strategy, a partial- or full-spectrum mixed bundling strategy, and a pure bundling strategy, where the latter strategy is optimal when capacities are unconstrained. These conclusions are contrary to findings in the prior literature on bundling that demonstrated the unambiguous dominance of the full-spectrum mixed bundling strategy. Thus, our work expands the frontier of bundling to an environment with vertically differentiated components and limited resources. We also explore how the bundling strategies change as we introduce an element of horizontal differentiation wherein different types of customers value the available components differently.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1242","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bundling strategies in a market context without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Upon arrival, each consumer, trying to maximize his own utility, must decide either to buy at the full price and get the item immediately or to place a nonwithdrawable reservation at a discount price and wait until the end of the sales season where the leftover units are allocated according to first-come-first-serve priority. We prove the existence of an equilibrium consumer's strategy in this game and develop a simple and accurate asymptotic approximation for it. Through an extensive numerical study, we find that our proposed mechanism delivers higher revenues than the markdown practice with a preannounced fixed discount. The benefit is more emphasized when the seller is more patient than the consumers and (1) the ratio between the number of units put up for sale and the expected demand is moderate and/or (2) the heterogeneity of the consumers' valuations is moderate to high. In our numerical experiments, the revenue gap can reach more than 12%, which is quite significant for retail businesses that typically operate with narrow margins.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1245","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical revenue management problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of 'wokeness'.

However, this type of transplantation is hindered in the United States by donor scarcity and rapid viability decay. Given these difficulties, the current U.S. liver allocation policy balances allocation likelihood and geographic proximity by allocating cadaveric livers hierarchically. We consider the problem of maximizing the efficiency of intraregional transplants through the redesign of liver allocation regions. We formulate the problem as a set partitioning problem that clusters organ procurement organizations into regions. We develop an estimate of viability-adjusted intraregional transplants to capture the trade-off between large and small regions. We utilize branch and price because the set partitioning formulation includes too many potential regions to handle explicitly. We formulate the pricing problem as a mixed-integer program and design a geographic-decomposition heuristic to generate promising columns quickly. Because the optimal solution depends on the design of geographic decomposition, we develop an iterative procedure that integrates branch and price with local search to alleviate this dependency. Finally, we present computational studies that show the benefit of region redesign and the efficacy of our solution approach. Our carefully calibrated test instances can be solved within a reasonable amount of time, and the resulting region designs yield a noticeable improvement over the current configuration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1249","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of organ allocation efficiency without addressing any social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

Excess demand that is accepted is backlogged and results in a backlog cost whereas demand that is refused results in a lost sales charge. Endogenizing the sales decision is appropriate in the presence of general convex order costs so that the firm is not forced to backlog a unit whose subsequent satisfaction would reduce total profits. In each period, the firm must determine the optimal order and sales strategy. We show that the optimal policy is characterized by an optimal buy-up-to level that increases with the initial inventory level and an order quantity that decreases with the initial inventory level. More importantly, we show the optimal sales strategy is characterized by a critical threshold, a backlog limit, that dictates when to stop selling. This threshold is independent of the initial inventory level and the amount purchased. We investigate various properties of this new policy. As demand stochastically increases, the amount purchased increases but the amount backlogged decreases, reflecting a shift in the way excess demand is managed. We develop two regularity conditions, one that ensures some backlogs are allowed in each period, and another that ensures the amount backlogged is nondecreasing in the length of the planning horizon. We illustrate the buy-up-to levels in our model are bounded above by buy-up-to levels from the pure lost sales and pure backlogging models.

A firm with a portfolio of these and other products\u2014that are often asymmetric in their degree of network externality or marginal cost\u2014may have to look beyond the traditional strategies of pure components, pure bundling, and mixed bundling. One such strategic alternative in a two-product case would be a so-called mixed bundling-1 under which the bundle and product 1 are offered, but the other product can only be purchased in a bundled form. The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast the impact of such asymmetry or symmetry in (direct) network externality and cost on the choice of bundling strategies. We model a monopolist firm that has a product in each of two categories and faces heterogeneous consumers. Results suggest that pure bundling is more profitable when both products have low marginal costs or high network externality whereas pure components or mixed bundling-1 is more profitable when the products diverge in their costs and network externality (e.g., only one product has network externality).

Schaefer, Brady Hunsaker, Mark S. Roberts The 12th-leading cause of death in the United States is liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatitis. The only viable solution to this disease is liver transplantation, but the supply of donors is far lower than the demand for livers. Liver allocation is a tricky business; competing interests of recipient prioritization (who needs it most, the probability of finding a good match), keeping the recipient options open, and expedited transport from donor to recipient (quick delivery of the liver to maintain high viability) must be balanced to allocate this scarce and valuable resource. To help with this allocation, the United Network of Organ Sharing, which operates the organ transplantation system in the United States, developed a local, regional, and national prioritization plan to try to balance these objectives. The authors developed a methodology that reconfigures donor regions to better balance these objectives, and they suggest that their regional configuration could improve liver allocation and save more lives than the current system. The insight for management: Through redesign of liver allocation regions mathematical methods can save lives.The End of the Robinson-Patman Act? Evidence from Legal Case Data (p. 2123) Ryan Luchs, Tansev Geylani, Anthony Dukes, Kannan Srinivasan The Robinson-Patman Act (RP) of 1936 is an antitrust statute aimed at protecting small businesses by limiting price setting in distribution channels.

Employee Motives and Firm Innovation (p. 2134) Henry Sauermann, Wesley M. Cohen What makes innovators more innovative? The authors examine data on more than 1,700 Ph.D. scientists and engineers to address this question. They find that motivation is a strong factor, but not all motivators have similar impact. More aggressive motives regarding intellectual challenge, independence, and money have a strong positive relationship with innovative output, whereas conservative, risk-averse motives regarding job security and responsibility tend to have a negative relationship. The insight for management: Innovators tend to be risk takers; innovation is better induced through more aggressive indicators. Choose incentives for your innovators well and reap the benefits of increased innovation.Integrating Dynamic Pricing and Replenishment Decisions Under Supply Capacity Uncertainty (p. 2154) Qi Feng In the face of uncertain demand and supply, what are the optimal pricing and stocking strategies? The author shows that the optimal stocking policy is characterized by two simple but critical values: a reorder point and a target safety stock. Under this policy, a positive order is issued if the inventory level is below the reorder point. For the pricing question, the author suggests that a simple list price policy fails to achieve optimality even under known demand. The author characterizes the profit improvement obtained from deploying dynamic pricing as opposed to static pricing, and finds that uncertain or constrained supply may induce a significant benefit from dynamic pricing. With excess supply, dynamic pricing is more valuable when procurement cost is high or when demand is more sensitive to price. With limited supply, however, the capacity restriction tends to be relaxed, reducing the value of dynamic pricing. The insight for management: In the face of uncertain supply and demand, dynamic pricing policies can be used to improve profitability.Selling with Binding Reservations in the Presence of Strategic Consumers (p. 2173) Nikolay Osadchiy, Gustavo Vulcano Is there an alternative to markdown pricing in retail, given that customers anticipate that items will eventually be marked down? It is well known that retailers often use price markdowns to discriminate between early buyers, who are price insensitive, and later buyers, who are willing to wait for a discount. But, because buyers can anticipate a markdown, some will wait to purchase, costing the retailer revenue. The authors analyze a binding reservations strategy: Upon arrival, each consumer must decide either to buy at the full price and get the item immediately or to place a binding reservation at a discount price and wait until the end of the sales season. They find that the proposed mechanism delivers 12% higher revenues in their analysis. The insight for management: Revenues may increase markdown strategy through binding reservations.The Firm as a Socialization Device (p. 2191) Abhijit Ramalingam, Michael T. Rauh Why do firms exist? What is their function? What do managers do? What is the role, if any, of social motivation in the market? The authors address these questions with a new theory of the firm, which unites some major themes in management, principal-agent theory, and economic sociology. They show that, although the market is a superior incentive mechanism, the firm has a comparative advantage with respect to social motivation. They then show that the market is efficient in environments that favor the provision of incentives, such as when subjective risk is low and performance is easy to measure. The firm is efficient in other environments where incentives are costly and/or ineffective. The insight for management: Both economic and social incentives are important to behavior; social elements of the organization may drive behaviors in environments where performance is difficult to measure.Bundling Strategies When Products Are Vertically Differentiated and Capacities Are Limited (p. 2207) Mihai Banciu, Esther Gal-Or, Prakash Mirchandani Should a mall space owner, or any owner of multiple capacity-constrained resources, offer space in different malls individually, as a bundled package, or sometimes bundled and sometimes not? Previous research found an unambiguous dominance of the mixed bundling strategy. These authors provide a new answer: all of the above, depending on the availabilities of the two resources. The authors find that the possible strategies that can arise as equilibrium behavior include a pure components strategy, a partial- or full-spectrum mixed bundling strategy, and a pure bundling strategy. The insight for management: Bundling strategies depend on the capacity and differentiation of the products being bundled.Optimal Bundling of Technological Products with Network Externality (p. 2224) Ashutosh Prasad, R. Venkatesh, Vijay Mahajan Facebook is an example of an Internet community that faces a positive network externality: The more people who belong, the more valuable the community becomes, with very little or no incremental cost. On the other hand, a handheld device that delivers Facebook to its members has convenience value (and cost) to the individual user, but not to the community as a whole. To leverage externalities, Facebook might like to bundle its product with a handheld device, but not vice versa. The authors suggest that mixed bundling is most appropriate in this situation; that is, a firm should bundle the network product with the purchase of the product with fewer network externalities, but not vice versa. If both products have low marginal costs and/or high positive network externalities, a pure bundling strategy makes sense. The asymmetry of the two products drives this varied result. The insight for management: The appropriate bundling strategy depends on individual products' network externalities and costs; in many cases, a mixed bundling strategy is appropriate.Imperfect Competition in Financial Markets: An Empirical Study of Island and Nasdaq (p. 2237) Bruno Biais, Christophe Bisi\u00e8re, Chester Spatt How does granularity of asset pricing affect liquidity? The grid is the increments of price acceptable in a trading market; a finer grid ostensibly could create more liquidity. The competition between Island and Nasdaq markets at the beginning of the century offers a natural laboratory to study competition between and within trading platforms and its consequences for liquidity supply. The authors studied the difference between the pricing grids used on Island and Nasdaq markets. Using the finer grid prevailing on the Island market, Island limit order traders undercut Nasdaq quotes much more than they undercut one another. A drop in the Nasdaq tick size triggered a drop in Island spreads despite the Island tick's already being very thin before Nasdaq decimalization. The insight for management: Perfect competition cannot be taken for granted, even on transparent open limit order books with a very thin pricing grid.The Behavior of Risk and Market Prices of Risk Over the Nasdaq Bubble Period (p. 2251) Gurdip Bakshi, Liuren Wu What were the harbingers of the Nasdaq bubble burst in the early 2000s? In their statistical analysis, the authors control for fluctuations in both risk levels and market prices of different sources of risk, and they estimate the model using the time-series returns and option prices on the Nasdaq during the period from March 1999 to March 2001. Their analysis reveals three key variations that may have signaled a burst. First, return volatility increased together with the rising Nasdaq index level, even though the two tend to move in opposite directions. Second, although the market price of diffusion return risk averages approximately 1.82 over the whole sample, the estimates reached negative territory at the end of 1999. The estimates reverted back to highly positive values after the collapse of the Nasdaq market. Third, the market price of jump risk increased with the rising Nasdaq valuation, and this increase in market price coincided with an increased imbalance in open interest between put and call options. The insight for management: Perhaps there are statistical signals that foretold the Nasdaq collapse.A Dynamic Inventory Model with the Right of Refusal (p. 2265) Sreekumar Bhaskaran, Karthik Ramachandran, John Semple When should a firm stop selling? Production and orders tend to lag behind sales, and inventory is used to buffer the difference. When inventory falls short, the firm can backlog demand at some backlog cost or refuse to service it (i.e., stop selling) resulting in a lost sale. When, then, is a backlog cost more than the lost sale? Each period, a firm must determine the optimal order and sales strategy. The authors show that the optimal policy is characterized by an optimal buy-up-to level that increases with the initial inventory level and an order quantity that decreases with the initial inventory level. More importantly, the authors show that the optimal sales strategy is characterized by a critical threshold, a backlog limit, that dictates when to stop selling. They show that, as demand increases, the amount purchased increases but the amount backlogged decreases, reflecting a shift in the way that excess demand is managed toward more refusals. The insight for management: In some cases, refusing an order and losing altogether may be preferable to backlogging it and servicing it later.Bargaining Chains (p. 2282) William S. Lovejoy In most supply chains, each firm negotiates with its immediately upstream and downstream partners to provide a product or service. In each stage, a firm might bargain with its immediate suppliers, who do the same with their suppliers, and so on. How does the structure of such \u201cbargaining chains\u201d affect supply chain performance? The author develops a model to generate chainwide predictions for efficiency and profitability in supply chains that follow such pairwise negotiations. The author further investigates the implications of his results for investments in process improvements or supplier development. The insight for management: Negotiations with suppliers directly affect the entire supply chain performance.An Exact Algorithm for Finding Extreme Supported Nondominated Points of Multiobjective Mixed Integer Programs (p. 2302) \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zpeynirci, Murat K\u00f6ksalan Some classic problems in operations research can be multiobjective, such as the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem. The authors present an algorithm to find all nondominated solution points of such problems. The algorithm finds all the desired points in a finite number of steps by changing the weights of the objective functions in a systematic way. The insight for management: New approaches to traditional problems may expedite their solutions, allowing more complex problems to be more readily solved.Reassessing Data Quality for Information Products (p. 2316) Debabrata Dey, Subodha Kumar How trustworthy is your database, and how reliable are the reports that emanate from it? The direct cost of poor data quality has been estimated to be in the billions of dollars per year for U.S. businesses. Poor data quality leads to several other intangible losses such as customer dissatisfaction, less effective decision making, and the reduced ability to execute business strategies. The authors advance recent theory on database quality and evaluate database accuracy and completeness as they relate to typical queries in their assessment of the impact of database problems on businesses. The insight for management: The report guiding your decisions is only as good as the database it comes from; research on database quality helps to clarify the costs of bad data.Design for Location? The Impact of Manufacturing Offshore on Technology Competitiveness in the Optoelectronics Industry (p. 2323) Erica Fuchs, Randolph Kirchain Today, only 28% of manufacturing value-added production occurs within the United States. Is product design affected by the trend toward offshoring? The authors present a case study of the impact of manufacturing offshore on technology competitiveness in the optoelectronics industry. It examines a critical design/facility location decision being faced by optoelectronic component manufacturers. The authors show that production location changes the relative production economics of the two competing designs\u2014one emerging, one prevailing. Specifically, if optoelectronic component firms shift production from the United States to countries in developing East Asia, the emerging designs that were developed in the United States may not be appropriate. Production characteristics are different abroad, and the prevailing design can be more cost effective in developing country production environments. The insight for management: Product design and production facility location decisions are intertwined and perhaps should not be treated independently.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1291","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['social motivation', 'socialization', 'inequities']","The article discusses the role of social motivation within firms and addresses the comparative advantages of firms in providing social incentives, indicating a moderate focus on social themes.

We develop a structural model to examine user demand for voice service and SMS. Specifically, we measure the own- and cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs and sequential discrete plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed individual consumption data of more than 6,000 customers, we find that SMS and voice service are small substitutes. A 10% increase in the price of voice minutes will induce about a 0.8% increase in the demand for SMS. The own-price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of approximately \u22120.1. Younger users' demand is far more inelastic than that of older users. We then conduct counterfactual policy experiments that fully capture the effects of changes in key parameters on the firm's revenues.

In particular, we consider the following practical strategic questions for the manager of a knowledge-intensive firm: Should her firm develop a formal knowledge system? And if so, how should it be managed, particularly in terms of what information to record? We find that firms benefit more from a knowledge system when they are larger, face the same issues more frequently, have higher turnover, and face problems about which there is less general knowledge. In terms of what information to record, a key insight is that recording moderately successful practices can be counterproductive, because doing so may inefficiently reduce employees' incentives to experiment. This \u201cstrong-form competency trap\u201d forces firms into an exploration\u2013exploitation trade-off. Firms that value a knowledge system most should also be most selective in recording information. We further find that recording successes is more valuable than recording failures, which supports firms' focus on best practice. Beyond these main principles, we also show that it may be optimal to disseminate know-how on a plant level but not on a firm level, and that recording backup solutions is most valuable at medium levels of environmental change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1101","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['knowledge management', 'employee-generated', 'incentives']","The article primarily focuses on knowledge management systems and their strategic implications for firms, with little emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

These collaborations vary in terms of the similarity of the competencies that partnering firms bring to the alliance. In same-function alliances, partnering firms have similar competencies, whereas in cross-function alliances, partners have very different competencies. On examining managers' view of these alliances, we find that, on average, same-function alliances are expected to perform better than cross-function alliances, holding fixed the level of inputs. A game-theoretic analysis shows that this apprehension about cross-function alliances is consistent with a Pareto-inferior equilibrium. A Pareto-superior equilibrium, however, suggests that partners in cross-function alliances may invest more in their alliances than those in same-function alliances. It is also often believed that increasing the number of partnering firms is not conducive for collaborative effort. Our analysis shows that this belief is correct for same-function alliances, but not for cross-function alliances. We test these equilibrium predictions in an experiment where we exogenously vary the type of alliance and the number of partnering firms. The experimental results lend support for the Pareto-superior equilibrium. Partners in cross-function alliances invested more than their counterparts in same-function alliances, and this difference in investment levels increased with the number of partnering firms. We extend our model to consider alliances where firms have an opportunity to learn from their partners and later leverage this knowledge outside the scope of their alliance. Though such learning increases the resources committed by alliance partners in the learning phase, it decreases investment in the subsequent competition and also dampens the overall investment across the two stages. In addition, an increase in interalliance competition decreases investments in the focal alliance but increases investment in the competition outside the scope of the alliance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1103","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['collaboration', 'competencies', 'investment']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of business alliances and performance metrics, with minimal reference to social themes.

We also discuss how to preserve the sample mean vector and sample covariance matrix exactly for any data perturbation method. We investigate the performance of the STDP method by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study and compare it with other existing perturbation methods. Of particular importance is the ability of STDP to reproduce characteristics of the joint tails of the distribution in order for database users to answer higher-level questions.

We perform an economic analysis of this incentive program, called Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), modeling in a game-theoretic framework the strategic interaction between CBP, trading firms, and terrorists. Our equilibrium results highlight the possibility that a properly run program can efficiently shift some of CBP's security burden to private industry.

If marginal and total benefits are negatively correlated, the usage charge should be set below the marginal cost. These results apply whether the seller has market power or is subject to competition. The difference between the profit-maximizing usage charge and marginal cost increases with buyer risk aversion.

Preferences depend on the satiation level and the habitual consumption level. These two state variables, together with the shape of the value function, drive the properties of the model. One unique feature of our model is that it addresses the trade-off between seeking variety and maintaining acquired habits. We examine several properties of our model, such as the nontrivial patterns of desirability (willingness to pay) for an additional unit of consumption, or the effect of abstaining from consumption (craving). We explore the shape of optimal consumption patterns in discrete and continuous choice settings. If subjects underestimate the changes in satiation and habituation levels, as occurs under projection bias, our model explains why people buy more when hungry, or prefer variety in advance of consumption but stay with the same consumption good in actual use.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1113","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical modification of a utility model without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One prominent feature of RFID technology is that once RFID tags are attached on the items at an upstream site, the same tags can be reused at its downstream sites at lower or zero variable cost. This creates an interesting, one-sided \u201cfree-rider\u201d problem, where the downstream would wait to free-ride on the upstream's first move, but not vice versa. Using a stylized game-theoretic model, we characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Compared to the first-best solution, firms in equilibrium tend to adopt too late. We then study the dual benefits of technology coordination between the two firms and find that it would not only save redundant costs of putting tags, but also speed up the downstream's RFID adoption. We also show that the equal-cost-split arrangement shifts the benefit of free-riding to the upstream, thereby mitigating the negative impacts in many cases. But it may distort the market when it operates in the optimal manner. The general message of the model is that technology coordination and cost-split each contribute to the mitigation of the free-rider problem in RFID adoption.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1121","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of RFID adoption and supply chain dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is a foundational problem in the merchant management of assets for the storage of commodities, such as energy sources and natural resources. When the commodity spot price evolves according to an exogenous Markov process, this work shows that the optimal inventory-trading policy of a risk-neutral merchant is characterized by two stage and spot-price dependent basestock targets. Under some assumptions, these targets are monotone in the spot price and partition the available inventory and spot-price space in each stage into three regions, where it is, respectively, optimal to buy and inject, do nothing, and withdraw and sell. In some cases of practical importance, one can easily compute the optimal basestock targets. The structure of the optimal policy is nontrivial because in each stage the merchant's qualification of high (selling) and low (buying) commodity prices in general depends on the merchant's inventory availability. This is a consequence of the interplay between the capacity and space limits of the storage asset and brings to light the nontrivial nature of the interface between trading and operations. A computational analysis based on natural gas data shows that mismanaging this interface can yield significant value losses. Moreover, adapting the merchant's optimal trading policy to the spot-price stochastic evolution has substantial value. This value can be almost entirely generated by reacting to the unfolding of price uncertainty, that is, by sequentially reoptimizing a model that ignores this source of uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1049","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of commodity trading and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The Fed intends to use this fee to induce DIs to effectively recirculate cash so that the societal cost of providing cash to the public is lowered. To examine the efficacy of this mechanism, we first characterize the social optimum and then analyze the response of DIs under a recirculation fee levied on cross-shipped cash. We show that neither a linear recirculation fee, which is the Fed's current practice, nor a more sophisticated nonlinear fee is sufficient to guarantee a socially optimal response from DIs. We then derive a fundamentally different mechanism that induces DIs to self-select the social optimum. Our mechanism incorporates a fairness adjustment that avoids penalizing DIs that recirculate their fair share of cash and rewards DIs that recirculate more than this amount. We demonstrate that the mechanism is easy to implement and tolerates a reasonable amount of imprecision in the problem parameters. We also discuss a concept of welfare-preserving redistribution wherein the Fed allows a group of DIs to reallocate (amongst themselves) their deposits and demand if such a possibility does not increase societal cost. Finally, we analyze the impact of incorporating the custodial inventory program, another component of the Fed's new policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1106","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['societal cost', 'fairness', 'welfare-preserving redistribution']","The article discusses mechanisms aimed at lowering societal costs and incorporates concepts of fairness and welfare-preserving redistribution, indicating a moderate focus on social impact alongside traditional business practices."],["2010","56","3","Sharon BelenzonSharon Belenzonsb135@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author, Tomer BerkovitzTomer Berkovitztb2122@columbia.eduGraduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author","Innovation in Business Groups","Using novel data on European firms, this paper investigates the relationship between business groups and innovation.

Despite this perception, existing work on academic inbreeding is scarce and mostly exploratory. Using data from Mexico, we find evidence that, first, academic inbreeding is associated with lower scholarly output. Second, the academically inbred faculty is relatively more centered on its own institution and less open to the rest of the scientific world. This navel-gazing tendency is a critical driver of its reduced scientific output when compared with noninbred faculties. Third, we reveal that academic inbreeding could be the result of an institutional practice, such that these faculty members contribute disproportionately more to teaching and outreach activities, which allows noninbred faculty members to dedicate themselves to the research endeavor. Thus, a limited presence of inbreds can benefit the research output of noninbreds and potentially the whole university, but a dominantly inbred environment will stifle productivity, even for noninbreds. Overall, our analysis suggests that administrators and policy makers in developing nations who aim to develop a thriving research environment should consider mechanisms to limit this practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1109","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['academic inbreeding', 'scholarly output', 'institutional practice']","The article discusses the negative impacts of academic inbreeding on scholarly productivity, which touches on institutional practices but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

However, such moves may also make imitation by local competitors easier. As a consequence, technology transfer may create competition in the local market. We introduce component-based technology transfer for the global firm as a means to deter or accommodate the imitators' entry, recognizing that components may differ in technological complexity. By choosing a subset of components to transfer, the global firm's decision has an impact not only on the imitators' fixed entry costs, but also on postentry competition based on variable costs. Our research identifies two different types of deterrence strategies\u2014the barrier-erecting strategy and the market-grabbing strategy. In the former deterrence strategy, the global firm retains enough component technology in the home country to make the potential imitator's fixed entry costs so high that it is not worthwhile entering. In the latter deterrence strategy, the global firm transfers enough component technology to the emerging market, reducing the global firm's variable cost to make the potential imitator's revenues so low that it is not worthwhile entering. Which deterrence strategy the global firm should employ depends on the degree to which geographical proximity reduces imitation costs and the degree of differentiation between the local firm's and the global firm's products. Some other interesting and counterintuitive results arise. For example, it may benefit a global firm to transfer less technology for products with a higher emerging market potential.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1111","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical strategies for technology transfer and competition without addressing social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus exhibiting no evidence of woke themes."],["2010","56","3","Eric DananEric Dananeric.danan@u-cergy.frUniversit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, THEMA, 95000 Cergy-Pontoise, FranceSearch for more papers by this author","Randomization vs. Selection: How to Choose in the Absence of Preference?","Decision makers sometimes have to choose between alternative options about which they have no preference: either they judge the options equally valuable (indifference) or they have no judgment about their relative value (noncomparability).

Specifically, we study the vehicle development process of a major auto company and use vehicle quality (warranty repairs) as our NPD performance metric. Our empirical results indicate that centrality in a product architecture network is related to quality according to an inverted-U relationship, which suggests that vehicle subsystems of intermediate complexity exhibit abnormally high levels of quality problems. To identify specific subsystems in danger of excessive quality problems, we characterize mismatches between product architecture and organizational structure by defining a new metric, called coordination deficit, and show that it is positively associated with quality problems.

Our model considers four factors: (1) the usable life of the product, (2) the rates at which consumers use the product, (3) the relation between package size and the variable cost of the product, and (4) the minimum quantities consumers seek to consume for each dollar they spend (we call these reservation quantities). We allow heterogeneity in the usage rates and reservation quantities for the consumers. We show that when the cost increases as a linear or convex function of the package size, the firm should make packages of the smallest possible size. Smaller packages reduce waste and allow consumers to more closely match their purchases with desired consumption. This in turn allows the firm to charge a higher unit price and also sell more unit volume. The results imply that in a market with multiple package sizes (produced by the same or competing firms), at least one of the packages must have the smallest possible size, provided the fixed cost of making the product is sufficiently low. For concave cost functions, the firm may find it optimal to make larger than smallest-size packages.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1119","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['waste', 'consumers', 'sustainability']","The article discusses reducing waste and aligning consumer purchases with desired consumption, which touches on sustainability themes.

This work relaxes that assumption in the context of charity auctions. Because understanding charitable motives has important implications for auction design and charities' fundraising strategies, this study investigates bidders' specific types of charitable motives and the strength of these motives. We carry out three controlled field experiments consisting of real-life auctions conducted on a local Internet auction site. We use a novel design in which we simultaneously run charity and noncharity auctions for identical products and vary the percentage donated to charity. Results show that auctions with proceeds donated to charity lead to significantly higher selling prices, a result due to a higher bidding by bidders with charitable motives rather than to increased bidder entry. We also find that increased prices only occur when the charitable donation is a percentage of the auction revenue, and that a fixed charitable donation associated with each auction has no effect on prices. Furthermore, we find that prices are increasing in the percentage donated to charity. We find considerable support for a model of voluntary shill-like bidding, where charitable bidders try to increase proceeds in charity auctions. We also find that auctions with 25% of revenue donated to charity had higher net revenue than noncharity auctions. Hence, companies may be able to use charity auctions as part of a corporate social responsibility strategy and at the same time increase profitability even though they donate part of the proceeds to charity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1120","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['charitable motives', 'charity', 'corporate social responsibility']","The article discusses charitable motives in the context of auctions and highlights the implications for corporate social responsibility, indicating a moderate focus on social impact alongside traditional business metrics.

How then should the firms manage their contract negotiations? The supply chain coordination literature focuses either on a single manufacturer selling to a single retailer or one manufacturer selling to many (possibly competing) retailers. We find that some key conclusions from those market structures do not apply in our setting, where multiple manufacturers sell through a single retailer. We allow the manufacturers to compete for the retailer's business using one of three types of contracts: a wholesale-price contract, a quantity-discount contract, or a two-part tariff. It is well known that the latter two, more sophisticated contracts enable the manufacturer to coordinate the supply chain, thereby maximizing the profits available to the firms. More importantly, they allow the manufacturer to extract rents from the retailer, in theory allowing the manufacturer to leave the retailer with only her reservation profit. However, we show that in our market structure these two sophisticated contracts force the manufacturers to compete more aggressively relative to when they only offer wholesale-price contracts, and this may leave them worse off and the retailer substantially better off. In other words, although in a serial supply chain a retailer may have just cause to fear quantity discounts and two-part tariffs, a retailer may actually prefer those contracts when offered by competing manufacturers. We conclude that the properties a contractual form exhibits in a one-manufacturer supply chain may not carry over to the realistic setting in which multiple manufacturers must compete to sell their goods through the same retailer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1122","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract negotiations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although this may generate incremental revenues in the short term, the long-term consequences of such a strategy are not immediately obvious: More discounted last-minute tickets may lead to more consumers anticipating the discount and delaying the purchase rather than buying at the regular (higher) prices, hence potentially reducing revenues for the company. To mitigate such behavior, many service providers have turned to opaque intermediaries, such as Hotwire.com, that hide many descriptive attributes of the service (e.g., departure times for airline tickets) so that the buyer cannot fully predict the ultimate service provider. Using a stylized economic model, this paper attempts to explain and compare the benefits of last-minute sales directly to consumers versus through an opaque intermediary. We utilize the notion of rational expectations to model consumer purchasing decisions: Consumers make early purchase decisions based on expectations regarding future availability, and these expectations are correct in equilibrium. We show that direct last-minute sales are preferred over selling through an opaque intermediary when consumer valuations for travel are high or there is little service differentiation between competing service providers, or both; otherwise, opaque selling dominates. Moreover, contrary to the usual belief that such sales are purely mechanisms for disposal of unused capacity, we show that opaque selling becomes more preferred over direct last-minute selling as the probability of having high demand increases. When firms randomize between opaque selling and last-minute selling strategies, they are increasingly likely to choose the opaque selling strategy as the probability of high demand increases. When firms with unequal capacities use the opaque selling strategy, consumers know more clearly where the opaque ticket is from and the efficacy of opaque selling decreases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1125","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on economic modeling and strategies for revenue management without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

Under the assumptions that margins are the same regardless of flexibility location, capacity investment costs are the same within and across stages, and flexibility is limited to a single stage of logistics (process) flexibility accompanied with necessary process (logistics) flexibility, we show that both types of flexibility are most effective when positioned directly at the source of variability. However, although expected profit increases as logistics flexibility is positioned closer to the source of variability (i.e., downstream for demand variability and upstream for supply variability), locating process flexibility anywhere except at the stage with variability leads to the same decrease in expected profit.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1127","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain flexibility without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We fill this gap by integrating research from human\u2013computer interaction, motivation, and technology-supported group work to theoretically derive mechanisms for increasing each individual's motivation within a collective setting. Specifically, we manipulate the interface of a computer-mediated idea generation system (a widely used collaboration tool) to enhance the system's motivational affordance, i.e., the system's properties that fulfill users' motivational needs. Results from two studies demonstrate that by embedding the theoretically derived mechanisms \u201cproviding feedback\u201d and \u201cdesigning for optimal challenge\u201d into the collaboration environment, significant performance gains were realized.

We find that preference sorting does play a role in generating the small firm effect: small firms attract those with prior preferences for autonomy who are similarly drawn into entrepreneurship. Similarly, ability sorting plays a role: those who ultimately become entrepreneurs may be drawn first to small firms because they offer tighter pay-for-performance links and can subsequently improve their expected earnings by becoming entrepreneurs, or because the skills required for success in small firms are also valuable in entrepreneurship. Evidence suggests that although those with the very least to lose do enter entrepreneurship with greater frequency, opportunity cost has at best a modest role to play in explaining the small firm effect.

Researchers have found that reference groups shape consumer evaluations of these product categories.

Indeed, in a field setting it is quite a challenge to isolate reference group effects from contextual effects and correlated effects. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious model that allows us to study how reference groups influence firm behavior and that lends itself to experimental analysis. With the aid of the model, we investigate the behavior of consumers in a laboratory setting where we can focus on the reference group effects after controlling for the contextual and correlated effects. The experimental results show that in the presence of strong reference group effects, limited editions and multiple products can help improve firms' profits. Furthermore, the trends in the purchase decisions of our participants point to the possibility that they are capable of introspecting close to two steps of thinking at the outset of the game and then learning through reinforcement mechanisms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1133","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product line decisions without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We define the performance of a group as the quality of the best ideas identified. Prior research has defined performance as the average quality of ideas or the number of ideas generated, ignoring what most organizations seek, a few great ideas. We build a theory that relates organizational phenomena to four different variables that govern the quality of the best ideas identified: (1) the average quality of ideas generated, (2) the number of ideas generated, (3) the variance in the quality of ideas generated, and (4) the ability of the group to discern the quality of the ideas. We test this theory with an experiment. We find that groups organized in the hybrid structure are able to generate more ideas, to generate better ideas, and to better discern the quality of the ideas they generate. Moreover, we find that the frequently recommended brainstorming technique of building on others' ideas is counterproductive; teams exhibiting such buildup neither create more ideas, nor are the ideas that build on previous ideas better.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1144","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational performance and idea generation without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Choice experiments allow the researcher to estimate preferences for product features that do not yet exist in the market. However, parameters estimated from experimental data often show marked inconsistencies with those inferred from the market, reducing their usefulness in forecasting and decision making. We propose an approach for combining choice-based conjoint data with individual-level purchase data to produce estimates that are more consistent with the market. Unlike prior approaches for calibrating conjoint models so that they correctly predict aggregate market shares for a \u201cbaseline\u201d market, the proposed approach is designed to produce parameters that are more consistent with those that can be inferred from individual-level market data. The proposed method relies on a new general framework for combining two or more sources of individual-level choice data to estimate a hierarchical discrete choice model. Past approaches to combining choice data assume that the population mean for the parameters is the same across both data sets and require that data sets are sampled from the same population. In contrast, we incorporate in the model individual characteristic variables, and assert only that the mapping between individuals' characteristics and their preferences is the same across the data sets. This allows the model to be applied even if the sample of individuals observed in each data set is not representative of the population as a whole, so long as appropriate product-use variables are collected that can explain the systematic deviations between them. The framework also explicitly incorporates a model for the individual characteristics, which allows us to use Bayesian missing-data techniques to handle the situation where each data set contains different demographic variables. This makes the method useful in practice for a wide range of existing market and conjoint data sets. We apply the method to a set of conjoint and market data for minivan choice and find that the proposed method predicts holdout market choices better than a model estimated from conjoint data alone or a model that does not include demographic variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1136","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['demographic variables', 'individual characteristics', 'preferences']","The article discusses the incorporation of demographic variables and individual characteristics in market data analysis, which suggests a recognition of diversity in consumer preferences.

We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior, investigate their potential drivers, and thereby devise a method to improve automated replenishment systems. Using orders, shipments, and point-of-sale data for 19,417 item\u2013store combinations over five stores, we show that (i) store managers consistently modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to nonpeak days, and (ii) this behavior is explained significantly by product characteristics such as case pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our regression results suggest that store managers improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. Based on these results, we construct a method to modify automated order advices by learning from the behavior of store managers. Motivated by the management coefficients theory, our method is efficient to implement and outperforms store managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1141","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and automated systems without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Monetary gambles, as it turns out, may be processed and evaluated differently than gambles with nonmonetary outcomes. Whereas monetary gambles involve numeric amounts that can be straightforwardly combined with probabilities to yield at least an approximate \u201cexpectation\u201d of value, nonmonetary outcomes are typically not numeric and do not lend themselves to easy combination with the associated probabilities. Compared with monetary gambles, the evaluation of nonmonetary prospects typically proves less sensitive to changes in the probability range (inside the extremes of certainty and impossibility), which, among other things, can yield preference reversals.

Money, kisses, and electric shocks: An affective psychology of risk. Psych.

U.S. Visa Policies and Compensation of Information Technology Professionals","The use of H-1B and other work visas to hire foreign information technology (IT) professionals in the United States has attracted significant controversy and policy debates. On one hand, hiring high-skill foreign IT professionals on work visas can be advantageous for U.S. firms and the overall economy. On the other hand, high-skill immigration can adversely impact the wages of foreign and American IT professionals. This study uses data on skills and compensation of more than 50,000 IT professionals in the United States over the period 2000\u20132005 to study patterns in compensation of foreign and American IT professionals to inform these debates. Contrary to the popular belief that foreign workers are a cheap source of labor for U.S. firms, we find that after controlling for their human capital attributes, foreign IT professionals (those without U.S. citizenship and those with H-1B or other work visas) earn a salary premium when compared with IT professionals with U.S. citizenship. The salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and for those on work visas fluctuate in response to supply shocks created by the annual caps on new H-1B visas. Setting lower and fully utilized annual caps results in higher salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and those with work visas. We discuss implications of this study for crafting informed visa- and immigration-related policies by the U.S. government, for staffing practices of firms, and for human capital investments by IT professionals.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1149","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['visa policies', 'immigration', 'compensation', 'wages', 'human capital']","The article discusses the implications of U.S. visa policies and their impact on compensation for foreign IT professionals, highlighting themes of immigration and labor market dynamics.

To evaluate the profitability of a design, a number of mathematical programming approaches have been proposed in the last three decades\u2014typically nonlinear integer optimization problems that can only be tackled heuristically for real-world instances. Recently, Chen and Hausman (2000) efficiently exploited the fractional programming properties of a stylized model for product line and price selection with the objective to maximize contribution given homogeneous customer behavior by an aggregate multinomial logit choice model. We extend the approach of Chen and Hausman (Chen, K. D., W. H. Hausman. 2000. Technical note: Mathematical properties of the optimal product line selection problem using choice-based conjoint analysis. Management Sci.46(2) 327\u2013332) to determine an optimal product line under a personalized or group pricing strategy in markets with multiple heterogeneous consumers such that total profit (including fixed costs) is maximized. Personalized/group pricing is a growing discrimination strategy that more and more businesses are realizing is not only very profitable, but also often implementable in the era of e-business. Our problem formulation allows to incorporate commonly applied attraction choice models including the multinomial logit, the Bradley\u2013Terry\u2013Luce, and approximately the first choice model. Though the problem is generally nonlinear, we show that the fractional substructure resulting from attraction choice models can still be exploited to globally solve real-world instances in reasonable time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1160","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product line design and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper highlights a potentially damaging impact of QR on retailer effort. By lowering downstream inventories, QR may compromise retailer incentives to exert sales effort on a manufacturer's product and may lead instead to greater sales effort on a competing product. Manufacturer-initiated quick response can therefore backfire, leading to lower sales of the manufacturer's product and, in some cases, to higher sales of a competing product. Evidence from case studies and interviews shows that some manufacturers view high retailer inventory as a means of increasing retailer commitment (\u201ca loaded customer is a loyal customer\u201d). By implication, manufacturers should recognize the effect we highlight in this paper: the potential of QR to lessen retailer sales effort. We show that relatively simple distribution contracts such as minimum-take contracts, advance-purchase discounts, and exclusive dealing, when adopted in conjunction with QR, can remedy the distortionary impact of QR on retailers' incentives. In two recent antitrust cases we find evidence that, consistent with our theory, manufacturers adopted exclusive dealing at almost the same time that they were making QR-type supply chain improvements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1154","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['supply chain', 'retailer effort', 'manufacturer', 'incentives', 'antitrust']","The article primarily focuses on supply chain innovations and their impact on retailer incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Therefore, the CAPM cannot be consistent with efficient frontiers for which every frontier portfolio has at least one negative weight or short position. We call such efficient frontiers \u201cimpossible,\u201d and show that impossible frontiers are difficult to avoid. In particular, as the number of assets, n, grows, we prove that the probability that a generically chosen frontier is impossible tends to one at a geometric rate. In fact, for one natural class of distributions, nearly one-eighth of all assets on a frontier is expected to have negative weights for every portfolio on the frontier. We also show that the expected minimum amount of short selling across frontier portfolios grows linearly with n, and even when short sales are constrained to some finite level, an impossible frontier remains impossible. Using daily and monthly U.S. stock returns, we document the impossibility of efficient frontiers in the data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1157","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of the capital asset pricing model and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Variety seeking behavior is modeled as a decrease in the willingness to pay for the product purchased on the previous purchase occasion. Using a three-stage Hotelling-type model, we show that the presence of variety seeking consumers reduces product differentiation offered in equilibrium, thereby explaining some otherwise counterintuitive findings in empirical research. We find that firms charge higher prices in Period 1 and lower prices in Period 2. The lower price in Period 2 represents the price incentive that firms need to offer to prevent the variety seeking consumers from switching. Furthermore, we find that the observed switching in a market may not fully capture the true magnitude of the underlying variety seeking tendencies among consumers. Finally, we show that the presence of variety seeking consumers leads to lower firm profits and a higher consumer surplus. Surplus increases for variety seeking consumers as well as regular consumers.

Prior theory has argued that quality certification is important in markets characterized by information asymmetry. However, there is limited understanding of the contingent factors that influence the efficacy of the quality signal. We focus on capability maturity model (CMM) certification, which is granted on the basis of a rigorous audit of software vendor's internal quality-oriented software construction practices, as a signal of unobservable quality. Drawing upon prior research in strategy and economics, we theorize that the impacts of CMM certification on a vendor's export performance are conditional on factors reflecting the vendor's strategy (diversification and location) and its competitive environment (the extent of CMM penetration in the vendor's competition). Analysis of panel data supports our predictions related to the contingent value of CMM certification, and shows that a software service provider gains more from certification in terms of its software exports when its service offerings are diversified, when it chooses to locate away from a cluster of other software service firms, and when the extent of CMM penetration in the competition is low. This study extends prior research in the information value of a quality signal on a firm's demand side that has, for the most part, focused solely on direct effects. We discuss the implications of our findings for the strategic trade-offs that managers of software service firms need to make.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1162","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['quality signaling', 'information asymmetry', 'CMM certification']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of quality signaling and market dynamics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper shows that the connection between director liability and board behavior is more subtle, because directors have multiple means to respond to an increase in liability exposure: They can increase oversight to prevent accounting manipulation and/or reduce performance-based CEO pay to mitigate the CEO's ex ante incentive to engage in manipulation. These two decisions are interrelated, implying that the effects of director liability on board oversight and CEO incentive pay are ambiguous. In particular, the model predicts that, for firms in which board oversight is difficult and costly (e.g., large firms with complex business operations), a stricter legal environment for directors leads to a lower level of board oversight, lower CEO incentive pay, and lower shareholder value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1165","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['litigation risk', 'board oversight', 'CEO incentive pay']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of board oversight and CEO compensation in relation to litigation risk, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Regarding reputation as the sole motivator for the auditor, we illustrate how reputational concerns induce an auditing firm to misreport. We investigate the reasons and circumstances under which such misreporting takes place.

In contrast to this intuition, this paper analyzes models with biased investors and finds that biases often have a significant impact on the equilibrium even if they are independent across investors. First, independent biases affect the equilibrium asset price if investor demand for the asset is a nonlinear function of the bias. Second, even if the demand function is linear in the bias, it may still have a significant impact on the equilibrium because of the fluctuation of the wealth distribution. An initial run-up of the stock price makes optimistic investors richer, which then further pushes the stock price up and leads to lower future returns. This effect can lead to price overshooting, i.e., a negative expected future return. Similarly, an initial drop of the stock price leads to higher future returns.

We argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand products.

We contrast this chance-constrained formulation with the average-performance constraints that have been used so far in the literature. We then propose a two-step solution for the staffing problem under chance constraints. In the first step, we introduce a random static planning problem (RSPP) and discuss how it can be solved using two different methods. The RSPP provides us with a first-order (or fluid) approximation for the true optimal staffing levels and a staffing frontier. In the second step, we solve a finite number of staffing problems with known arrival rates\u2014the arrival rates on the optimal staffing frontier.

A kernel specific to the domain of finance is developed. This financial kernel constructs features shown in prior research to be helpful in detecting management fraud. A large empirical data set was collected, which included quantitative financial attributes for fraudulent and nonfraudulent public companies. Support vector machines using the financial kernel correctly labeled 80% of the fraudulent cases and 90.6% of the nonfraudulent cases on a holdout set. Furthermore, we replicate other leading fraud research studies using our data and find that our method has the highest accuracy on fraudulent cases and competitive accuracy on nonfraudulent cases. The results validate the financial kernel together with support vector machines as a useful method for discriminating between fraudulent and nonfraudulent companies using only publicly available quantitative financial attributes.

Vertical differentiation can arise from differences in item quality, item value certainty, seller reliability, or a combination of these factors. We characterize the form of the bidding equilibria and derive expressions for the corresponding allocative efficiency and expected seller revenue. When bidders are restricted to submit at most one bid, our theory predicts the existence of a unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium that resembles a form of probabilistic \u201cmating-of-likes.\u201d Allowing unit-demand bidders to place an arbitrary number of bids induces complex strategy profiles where bidders place positive bids in all available auctions. Higher bidder types tend to follow more targeted strategies, focusing their \u201cserious\u201d bids on fewer and, generally, higher quality auctions. The nature of the bidding equilibria introduces allocative inefficiencies that arise from the lack of coordination in auction selection among bidders. We test our theoretical propositions in a controlled laboratory experiment while also utilizing a domain specific risk score to help assess how the bidders' risk type affects their bidding behavior. In support of our theory we find evidence of a probabilistic assortative matching between bidder and auction types. We also find that low risk type bidders tend to crowd on the highest auction and will pay a premium for the certainty it offers, whereas high risk type bidders fail to appropriately adjust for risk associated with the lowest auction, leading to overbidding. These lead to an interesting focal anomaly whereby bids are concentrated on the highest and lowest auctions, bypassing intermediate auctions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1176","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auction theory and bidding behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Dr. Yan finds the opposite; biases often have a significant impact on the equilibrium even if they are independent across investors. Across a number of different assumptions on the form of investor bias, Dr. Yan shows that a modest amount of bias can have a large impact on the equilibrium. Investor bias can cause an initial run-up of the stock price and make optimistic investors richer in the short term, which then further pushes the stock price up and leads to lower future returns in the longer term. This effect can lead to such a level of price overshooting that a stock might have a negative expected future return. Conversely, an initial drop of the stock price leads to higher future returns. The insight for management: Knowing the market psychology as well as the market fundamentals can be important for earning superior returns.eBay's Crowded Evenings: Competition Neglect in Market Entry Decisions (p. 1060) Uri Simonsohn A Smashburger and a Five Guys Burgers and Fries open on the same block next to the University of Dayton in the same month. Do firms such as these neglect competition when making entry decisions? Dr. Simonsohn examines this question by analyzing the time of day at which eBay sellers set their auctions to end for nearly 15,000 auctions of DVDs. Conventional wisdom (and the advice of many ``how to sell on eBay'' books) is to set auction ending times consistent with peak bidding times, but on eBay the strategy is more conventional than wise. Dr. Simonsohn shows that the peak for sellers is actually more pronounced than the peak for buyers; a disproportionate share of auctions end during peak bidding hours. Worse still for sellers: Peak hours exhibit lower selling rates and prices. This overcrowding of sellers at peak times appears to be by choice and not by chance; peak listing is more prevalent among sellers likely to have chosen ending time strategically as demonstrated by their willingness to pay a premium for their auction to close during peak hours. This result suggests that assessing rather than assuming the rationality of firm behavior may be wise. The insight for management: A seller must know the competition as well as the customer.Vertically Differentiated Simultaneous Vickrey Auctions: Theory and Experimental Evidence (p. 1074) Ravi Bapna, Chrysanthos Dellarocas, Sarah Rice Vickrey auctions are commonplace: They are used on eBay, for procurement of services by major organizations, and even for oil and mineral rights. Vertical differentiation can arise from differences in item quality, seller reliability, etc. Drs. Bapna, Dellarocas, and Rice study settings where a number of sellers simultaneously offer vertically differentiated Vickrey auctions for imperfect substitute goods. They find that low bidders will tend to place positive bids in all available auctions whereas higher bidders tend to follow more targeted strategies, focusing their \"serious\" bids on fewer and, generally, higher-quality auctions. The lack of coordination in auction selection among bidders might lead to high bidding in one auction and no bidding in another. They test the theory in a controlled laboratory experiment and find that low-risk-type bidders tend to crowd on the highest auction and will pay a premium for the certainty that it offers, whereas high-risk-type bidders fail to appropriately adjust for risk associated with the lowest auction, leading to overbidding. These behaviors lead to an interesting result whereby bids are concentrated on the highest and lowest auctions, bypassing intermediate auctions. The insight for management: Although auctions are touted for extracting surplus and driving higher revenues, the ``price of anarchy'' in a multiple-auction setting is the loss of efficiency arising from uncoordinated buyer behavior.Staffing Call Centers with Uncertain Demand Forecasts: A Chance-Constrained Optimization Approach (p. 1093) Itai Gurvich, James Luedtke, Tolga Tezcan Call centers often must staff for multiple customer and agent types while trying to achieve high-quality service in the face of high call volume uncertainty. Drs. Gurvich, Luedtke, and Tezcan introduce a formulation of the staffing problem that requires that the minimum service levels are met with high probability rather than meeting some average level of performance over time. Despite uncertain demand rates, their two-step solution allows them to approach the problem as if arrival rates are known. The result is a solution that is feasible with respect to the uncertain demand constraint and nearly optimal for large call centers. The insight for management: Clever approaches to a problem with high demand uncertainty and dedicated resource types can be used to reduce errors due to demand forecast and thereby improve staffing and customer service.Workplace Peers and Entrepreneurship (p. 1116) Ramana Nanda, Jesper B. S\u00f8rensen How much do entrepreneurial tendencies transfer between coworkers? Is an individual more likely to become an entrepreneur if his or her coworkers have been entrepreneurs before? Drs. Nanda and S\u00f8rensen examine whether the likelihood of entrepreneurial activity is related to the prior career experiences of an individual's coworkers. They test their theory with a unique panel data set from Denmark covering more than a quarter of a million coworkers over an 18-year span. They find that coworkers can increase the likelihood that an individual will perceive entrepreneurial opportunities and can increase his or her motivation to pursue those opportunities. Furthermore, they find that peer influences are strongest for those who have less exposure to entrepreneurship in other aspects of their lives. The insight for management: A more entrepreneurial environment might be fostered through the juxtaposition of experienced entrepreneurs and employees with a less entrepreneurial background.Efficient Structures for Innovative Social Networks (p. 1127) William S. Lovejoy,  Amitabh Sinha What lines of communication among members of an organization are most productive in the early, idea-generation phase of innovation? Drs. Lovejoy and Sinha investigate this question with a model of knowledge transfer operating through a social network. They find that idea generation is accelerated when people in the organization dynamically churn through a large set of conversational partners over time, which reduces information bottlenecks. They suggest that group meetings, in which the content of conversations is available to all for consideration, are another way to learn in parallel and accelerate the ideation process, although for complex problems they may not offer significant advantages over the best decentralized networks. The insight for management: Water cooler conversations and staff meetings might seem unproductive, but they may be an important ingredient of innovation in an organization.Detecting Management Fraud in Public Companies (p. 1146) Mark Cecchini, Haldun Aytug, Gary J. Koehler, Praveen Pathak How can auditors and government regulators better allocate their time investigating companies to avoid corporate disasters like Enron? Drs. Cecchini, Aytug, Koehler, and Pathak provide a data mining methodology for detecting management fraud using basic financial data. They collected a large data set of quantitative financial attributes for 205 fraudulent and 6,427 nonfraudulent public companies. Their approach correctly labeled 80% of the fraudulent cases and 90% of the nonfraudulent cases. The results show that the methodology has predictive value because, using only historical data, it was able to distinguish fraudulent from nonfraudulent companies in subsequent years. The insight for management: Auditing firms and government regulators can better target their efforts through identifying the most likely fraudulent companies before planning their detailed investigations.Why Are Bad Products So Hard to Kill? (p. 1161) Duncan Simester, Juanjuan Zhang RCA's SelectaVision was a disk-based format for home movies at the advent of the VCR, and it was a monumental market failure. Yet RCA continued to invest in marketing and development of that product until it was acquired by General Electric in 1986. Products will fail (as evidenced by the DeLorean and New Coke in the 1980s alone), but it is puzzling that firms often continue to invest in product development projects when they should know that demand will be low. Drs. Simester and Zhang argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand products. The insight for management: To avoid throwing good money after bad, a check-and-balance system should be in place to temper the unbridled optimism typically embodied in product managers.Structural Estimation of the Effect of Out-of-Stocks (p. 1180) Andr\u00e9s Musalem, Marcelo Olivares, Eric T. Bradlow, Christian Terwiesch, Daniel Corsten What is the cost of a stockout? At its simplest, it is a lost or deferred sale, coupled with some less-quantified customer dissatisfaction. However, in many cases, the purchaser may just purchase a near substitute. Drs. Musalem, Olivares, Bradlow, Terwiesch, and Corsten look at the impact of substitute products on the cost of a stockout. Their estimation method uses store-level data on sales and partial information on product availability. The model allows for flexible substitution patterns and can be applied to data from multiple markets in categories with a relatively large number of alternatives. It also applies to slow-moving products as well as frequent out-of-stocks. They illustrate how the model can be used to assist the decisions of a store manager in two ways. First, they show how to quantify the lost sales induced by out-of-stock products. Second, they provide insights on the financial consequences of out-of-stocks and suggest price-promotion policies that can be used to help mitigate their negative economic impact, which run counter to simple commonly used methods. The insight for management: An accurate estimate of the cost of a stockout is essential for making inventory-carrying decisions and depends on a number of product-family-related factors.Is Regime Switching in Stock Returns Important in Portfolio Decisions? (p. 1198) Jun Tu How should your portfolio change during bull and bear markets? Statistical analysis of historical data might lead to a portfolio decision, but, given that bull markets have both higher mean return and lower variance in returns than bear markets, parameters based on those historical data may be misleading if the market regime turns to a bear market. Dr. Tu shows that accounting for whether you are in a bull or bear market is critical: Ignoring regime switching might cost your portfolio more than 2% per year and as much as 10%. These results suggest that the more realistic regime-switching model is fundamentally different from the commonly used single-state model and hence should be employed instead in portfolio decisions irrespective of concerns about model or parameter uncertainty. The insight for management: To increase returns and reduce the risk of misestimating portfolio parameters, portfolios based on historical performance data should be evaluated whether the current market dynamic matches that over which the portfolios were evaluated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1218","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of market behavior and investor psychology without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We conceptualize complementarities between the hardware and software platforms, software platform and applications, and applications and services. The complementarities are theorized to influence migration intention, with current generation of the consumer's platform being a key moderator.

A variety of widely used NPD project management approaches, including heavyweight project management, may allow or even encourage engineers to introduce late design changes and exhibit weak cost compliance, reducing the product's profit or competitiveness. Providing specifically designed incentives for individuals can eliminate such encouragement, and thus improve cost compliance and project timeliness. This paper discusses several practical incentive schemes, including profit-sharing contracts and component-level target costing. For many industrial projects, component-level target costing makes the most efficient use of available information to optimize project outcomes and reduce development times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1175","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and project management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with liquidity constraints, we find a positive relation between founder prior wealth and start-up size. The relationship between prior wealth and start-up performance, as measured by profitability on assets, increases in the first three wealth quartiles. In the top wealth quartile, however, profitability drops sharply in wealth.

Motivated by these revenue management initiatives in industry, we consider a dynamic pricing problem facing a firm that sells given initial inventories of multiple substitutable and perishable products over a finite selling horizon. Because the products are substitutable, individual product demands are linked through consumer choice processes. Hence, the seller must formulate a joint dynamic pricing strategy while explicitly incorporating consumer behavior. For an integrative model of consumer choice based on linear random consumer utilities, we model this multiproduct dynamic pricing problem as a stochastic dynamic program and analyze its optimal prices. The consumer choice model allows us to capture the linkage between product differentiation and consumer choice, and readily specializes to the cases of vertically and horizontally differentiated assortments. When products are vertically differentiated, our results show monotonicity properties (with respect to quality, inventory, and time) of the optimal prices and reveal that the optimal price of a product depends on higher quality product inventories only through their aggregate inventory rather than individual availabilities. Furthermore, we show that the price of a product can be decomposed into the price of its adjacent lower quality product and a markup over this price, with the markup depending solely on the aggregate inventory. We exploit these properties to develop a polynomial-time, exact algorithm for determining the optimal prices and the profit. For a horizontally differentiated assortment, we show that the profit function is unimodal in prices. We also show that individual, rather than aggregate, product inventory availability drives pricing. However, we find that monotonicity properties observed in vertically differentiated assortments do not hold.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1178","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and consumer choice without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Social contagion acknowledges the mutual influence among organizations within an institutional field and implicates information transmission through direct contact and observation as the mechanisms underlying influence transfer. We propose hypotheses predicting a hospital's likelihood of adopting electronic medical records as a function of its susceptibility to the influence of prior adopters, the infectiousness or potency of influence exerted by adopting hospitals, and its social and spatial proximity to prior adopters. Results obtained by fitting a heterogeneous diffusion model to data from a sample drawn from an annual survey, spanning 1975 to 2005, of almost 4,000 U.S. hospitals suggest that diffusion can be accelerated if specific attention is given to increasing social contagion effects. In particular, with respect to susceptibility to influence, greater hospital size and age are positively related to the likelihood of adoption for nonadopters, whereas younger hospitals are associated with greater infectiousness for adopters. A hospital's \u201ccelebrity\u201d status also contributes to its infectiousness. We further find strong effects for social proximity and significant regional effects for spatial proximity and hospital size, suggesting that geographical covariates should be included in diffusion studies. Results also reinforce the importance of theorizing about and including interactions in examinations of social contagion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1183","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['social contagion', 'influence', 'adoption', 'hospital size', 'geographical covariates']","The article discusses the diffusion of electronic medical records through social contagion, which implies some awareness of social dynamics in organizational behavior.

The resources differ by their level of flexibility, where \u201clevel-k flexibility\u201d refers to the ability to process k different product types. We present an exact set-theoretic methodology to analyze newsvendor networks with multiple products and parallel resources. This simple approach is sufficiently powerful to prove that (i) flexibility exhibits decreasing returns and (ii) the optimal portfolio will invest in at most two, adjacent levels of flexibility in symmetric systems, and to characterize (iii) the optimal flexibility configuration for asymmetric systems as well. The optimal flexibility configuration can serve as a theoretical performance benchmark for other configurations suggested in the literature. For example, although chaining is not optimal in our setting, the gap is small and the inclusion of scale economies quickly favors chaining over pairing. We also demonstrate how this methodology can be applied to other settings such as product substitution and queuing systems with parameter uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1184","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity and flexibility in resource management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or DEI.

Furthermore, they are consistent with observed violations of the independence axiom, such as the preference reversal in the Allais paradox, and predict that the decision maker takes on less risk compared to an expected utility maximizer.

We first examine an individual firm controlling production and two stages of inventory under uncertain input and output prices and operating costs.

We characterize the dynamics of inventory, market price, and gross margin based on theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical evidence from the petroleum industry. We find that inventory fluctuations lag behind price variations, and the length of the lags depend on how far the inventory is from the source of the supply or demand shocks.

This paper shows that the ability of early entry to deter future competitors' entry leads firms to enter the market at a rate faster than demand is expanding. If there is the potential for many firms to enter the market, firms may be less likely to enter because of future competitor entry to correct any market opportunities.

Angst, Ritu Agarwal, V. Sambamurthy, Ken Kelley On February 17, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law HR 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which allocates $19.2 billion in funding to support the adoption and use of health information technology to reduce clerical errors and costs in health care. This leads to the important question: What mechanisms influence the swift and successful diffusion of technological innovations at hospitals? The authors use a \u201csocial contagion\u201d model to study the diffusion of electronic medical records in the population of U.S. hospitals; hospitals have mutual influence on each other for information technology adoption. The authors look at 20 years of data from almost 4,000 U.S. hospitals and suggest that diffusion can be accelerated if specific attention is given to increasing adoption among well-known, larger, older hospitals in densely populated geographic regions. The insight for management: Targeting specific influential institutions for a new technology may vastly increase its rate of adoption.Lean and Hungry or Fat and Content?

Miguel Villas-Boas Is the presence of Toyota's Prius hindering the entrance of other hybrid automobiles in the marketplace? In developing industries like satellite radio and hybrid automobiles, firms have to decide whether and when to enter the market depending on the state of demand, existing firms in the industry, and the firm's capabilities. The authors investigate a model of increasing demand in which firms decide when to enter the market, anticipating the strategic behavior of other potential entrants and the effects of entry on future potential entrants. They show that, because early entry by a firm can deter future competitors' entry, firms may strategically enter the market at a rate faster than demand is expanding. With low barriers to entry, firms may be less likely to strategically enter ahead of demand because future competitor entry may limit future profit opportunity. The insight for management: In markets with barriers to entry, the first-mover advantage might include not only an established position in the market, but also greater market share in the long run because of fewer subsequent entrants.Optimal Choice and Beliefs with Ex Ante Savoring and Ex Post Disappointment (p. 1272) Christian Gollier, Alexander Muermann Don't worry\u2014no matter what you decide, you'll regret it. \u2014Author Unknown Formerly, decision makers were treated as stonemen when modeling how decisions are made; outcomes were evaluated on their merit only, not for the feelings of the decision makers up to the time the decision is made and after the outcome is realized. The authors propose a new decision criterion under risk in which individuals experience both anxiety before the decision and regret after. The decision maker may be an optimist, but this optimism increases both anxiety and regret at the time the outcome is recognized. The authors show that these feelings yield a preference for early resolution of uncertainty, and they predict that the decision maker takes on less risk compared with an expected utility maximizer. For example, such a decision maker is more likely to purchase an overpriced insurance contract with a low deductible; there is less anxiety at the time of decision as one awaits an outcome and less regret should the contract be enforced. The insight for management: People can exhibit behaviors consistent with reducing both anxiety and regret, structuring products that satisfy both of these desires and may perform admirably in the market.Optimal Flexibility Configurations in Newsvendor Networks: Going Beyond Chaining and Pairing (p. 1285) Achal Bassamboo, Ramandeep S. Randhawa, Jan A. Van Mieghem When a firm produces several different products, should the products share resources, or should the firm establish dedicated resources for some of them? Resource pooling improves utilization but may require that more employee training or less-efficient multipurpose capital resources be used in both processes. Dedicated resources reduce scheduling complexity and allow for more specialization. The authors suggest a way to find the optimal blend of specialized and shared resources. They find that increasing flexibility eventually exhibits decreasing returns, and they characterize the optimal flexibility configuration in a variety of situations. They evaluate \u201cchaining\u201d and \u201cpairing\u201d of similar resources to various tasks to strike a desirable flexibility/specialization blend; each resource might be assigned to at most two similar tasks, but more varied assignments can be detrimental. The insight for management: Resource flexibility to a limited degree can improve throughput and resource utilization but, if overused, can result in lost productivity.Model of Migration and Use of Platforms: Role of Hierarchy, Current Generation, and Complementarities in Consumer Settings (p. 1304) Xin Xu, Viswanath Venkatesh, Kar Yan Tam, Se-Joon Hong When I upgraded to third-generation (3G) wireless phone services, I considered a number of features and their interaction\u2014not only coverage and cost, but also issues from operating system and user interface to available applications and e-mail provider interconnectivity. How do these complex interconnected advances in hardware and software capabilities affect consumer migration to new platforms and subsequent platform success? The authors develop and test a model of platform migration to explain consumers' reactions to the newest generation of an information and communication technology platform. They test the model with survey data from more than 4,000 consumers before and after the introduction of the 3G mobile data services platform in Hong Kong. The authors find that user perceptions of technology and social influences play a role but that technology complementarity and the extent of change in platform play a strong role in adoption decisions. The insight for management: Technological advances in complex products depend heavily on complementary advances in other areas for successful consumer migration; careful consideration to the timing and nature of advances must be given to encourage consumer migration.Incentives in New Product Development Projects and the Role of Target Costing (p. 1324) J\u00fcrgen Mihm The complexity of many products forces organizations to specialize in their new product development; an automobile, for example, has interior designers, exterior designers, and engine designers who work somewhat autonomously in their efforts to develop a new model. How do the incentives of these individual groups affect profitability and development time? What can management do to curtail overdesign and project delays in new product development? The author suggests that popular project management approaches may allow or even encourage engineers to introduce late design changes and exhibit weak cost compliance, reducing the product's profitability or competitiveness. The \u201cheavyweight\u201d project manager may be perceived as an inspector rather than a collaborator and may receive active or passive resistance rather than cooperation; engineers in various departments will work to maximize their own satisfaction rather than the product as a whole. The author proposes practical incentive schemes, including profit-sharing contracts and component-level target costing, which are shown to improve cost compliance and project timeliness. The insight for management: Appropriate incentive schemes and organizations can directly contribute to the successful new product development project.Joint Dynamic Pricing of Multiple Perishable Products Under Consumer Choice (p. 1345) Yal\u00e7\u0131n Ak\u00e7ay, Harihara Prasad Natarajan, Susan H. Xu Firms are increasingly adopting revenue management methods to improve profits. The problem gets harder when there are multiple classes of substitutable products, such as standard and deluxe rental cars or hotel rooms. Because the products are substitutable, individual product demands are linked through consumer choice processes. Hence, the seller must formulate a joint dynamic pricing strategy while explicitly incorporating consumer behavior. The authors show that pricing policy must be based on the form of product differentiation: If one product is superior to the other across all consumers (e.g., a deluxe room), optimal pricing can be based solely on aggregate inventory rather than individual inventories of each product, and the inventory of higher-quality product determines the price difference between the two substitute products. For products without a uniformly clear customer preferences (such as early or late flight departure times), the authors show that individual, rather than aggregate, product inventory availability drives pricing for each product. The insight for management: Optimal yield management strategies of substitute products depend directly on the clarity of consumer preferences between them.Optimal Control and Equilibrium Behavior of Production-Inventory Systems (p. 1362) Owen Q. Wu, Hong Chen The relationship between commodity inventory and short-term price variations is crucial to industries such as petroleum. The authors investigate the inventory\u2013price relationship in two dimensions: across time and across production stages. They characterize the dynamics of inventory, market price, and gross margin based on theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical evidence from the petroleum industry. They find that inventory fluctuations lag behind price variations and that the length of the lags depends on how far the inventory is from the source of the supply or demand shocks. They also find that shocks are both dampened and delayed when propagating through the production stages and that shocks have a prolonged effect on inventories and prices at both stages. The insight for management: The spot and futures markets for commodities such as oil depend heavily on the total inventory of oil throughout the supply chain.Improving Supply Chain Performance and Managing Risk Under Weather-Related Demand Uncertainty (p. 1380) Frank Youhua Chen, Candace Arai Yano Weather is a great metaphor for life\u2014sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, and there's nothing much you can do about it but carry an umbrella. \u2014Pepper Giardino The U.S. National Research Council has estimated that 46% of U.S. gross domestic product is affected by weather. The authors consider a manufacturer\u2013retailer supply chain for a seasonal product whose demand is weather sensitive. They examine how a manufacturer can structure his umbrella: a weather-linked rebate to improve his expected profit. Their proposed rebate contract offers advantages: It requires no verification of leftover inventory and/or markdown amounts, it has no adverse effect on sales effort by the retailer, it is flexible, and it offers opportunities for both manufacturer and retailer to limit their weather-related risk. The insight for management: Mutually beneficial weather-related hedging can improve supply chain performance and reduce risk.Management Economics in a Large Retail Company (p. 1398) W. Stanley Siebert, Nikolay Zubanov Is your middle management worth what you pay them? The authors use unique data from 245 stores of a UK retailer to study links among middle (store) manager skills, sales, and manager pay. After controlling for a number of variables, they find that the best middle managers can produce 13.9% higher sales per worker than the worst. In this retail environment, \u201ccommercial awareness\u201d\u2014knowing the products, traffic patterns, and external perception of the store\u2014is a key contributor to the success of the store manager. At this retailer, incentive-based contracts allow managers to share approximately 20% of the benefit (or loss) that they produce, but this does not match the benefits that they generate. Abler managers do not extract the full surplus that they produce, implying that their skills are company specific, producing a sort of competitive advantage in the marketplace. The insight for management: Your middle management can matter. Develop their skills in-house to create firm-specific human capital as a source of competitive advantage, and create incentive pay structures for middle management to keep them paid above market but below their marginal contribution to your company.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1231","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['health information technology', 'clerical errors', 'costs', 'adoption']","The article discusses the adoption of health information technology in hospitals, focusing on reducing clerical errors and costs.

Our approach is motivated by the increasing evidence that size (SMB), book-to-market (HML), and momentum (MOM) factors, along with the market factor, adequately describe international stock returns, and by the direct link between investors' portfolio choice problems and international asset pricing theories and tests. Using data from 10 developed countries during the period 1981\u20132008, we show that the \u201caugmented\u201d optimal portfolio involving local factor funds substantially outperforms the \u201cbenchmark\u201d optimal portfolio comprising country market indices only as measured by their portfolio Sharpe ratios. This strongly rejects the intersection hypothesis which posits that the local factor funds do not span investment opportunities beyond what country market indices do. Among the three classes of factor funds, HML funds contribute most to the efficiency gains. In addition, the local version of factor funds outperforms the global factor funds. The added gains from local factor diversification are significant for both in-sample and out-of-sample periods, and for a realistic range of additional investment costs for factor funds, and remain robust over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1191","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical investment strategy and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To minimize the impact of disruptions, a proper incentive mechanism has to be in place so that the suppliers provide prompt restoration and recovery services to the customer. A widely adopted incentive mechanism is performance-based contracting (PBC), in which suppliers receive compensation based on realized system uptime. A key obstacle is that disruptions occur infrequently, making it very expensive for a supplier to commit the necessary resources for recovery because they will be idle most of the time. In this paper, we show that designing a successful PBC creates nontrivial challenges that are unique to this environment. Namely, because of the infrequent and random nature of disruptions, a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in counterintuitive optimal behavior. We compare the efficiencies of two widely used contracts, one based on sample-average downtime and the other based on cumulative downtime, and identify the supplier's ability to influence the frequency of disruptions as an important factor in determining which contract performs better. We also show that implementing PBC may create high agency cost when equipment is very reliable. This counterintuitive situation arises because the realized downtimes from which the customer might intuit about the supplier's capacity investment are highly uncertain when there are not many samples of downtimes, i.e., when disruptions occur rarely.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1193","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of performance-based contracting and operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The supplier and the retailers all try to minimize their own inventory-related costs. In contrast to the retailers' newsvendor-type ordering behavior (under which retailers may place orders freely in every period), we propose two scheduled ordering policies: the scheduled balanced ordering policy (SBOP) and the scheduled synchronized ordering policy (SSOP). Under both the SBOP and SSOP, retailers are allowed to order freely only in one period of an ordering cycle, and receive fixed shipments in other periods. Retailers take turns to order freely under the SBOP, while under the SSOP all retailers order freely in the same period. With the average supply chain cost per period as the performance measure, we identify mathematical conditions under which scheduled ordering policies outperform the newsvendor-type ordering. Through a large-scale numerical study, we find that scheduled ordering policies are most effective when (i) the supplier's holding and expediting costs are high and the retailer's backorder cost is small, (ii) the end-customer demand variance and correlation are high, and (iii) the supplier's capacity is high. In addition, we observe that the behavior of the SSOP often complements that of the SBOP. Whereas the SBOP is better than SSOP when the supplier's capacity is low and when the end-customer demand correlation level is high, the SSOP is better when the opposite conditions prevail.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1196","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain performance and cost minimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that the optimal response to an ad-sponsored rival often entails business model reconfigurations. We also find that when there is an ad-sponsored entrant, the incumbent is more likely to prefer to compete through the subscription-based or the ad-sponsored model, rather than the mixed or the dual model, because of cannibalization and endogenous vertical differentiation concerns.

The \u201csmall-world\u201d argument in social network theory emphasizes that people are, on average, only a few connections away from the information they seek. However, we argue that such a network structure does not benefit everyone: some employees may have longer search paths in locating knowledge in an organization\u2014their world may be large. We theorize that this disadvantage is the result of more than just an inferior network position. Instead, two mechanisms\u2014periphery status and homophily\u2014jointly operate to aggravate the inefficiency of search for knowledge. Employees who belong to the periphery of an organization because of their minority gender status, lower tenure, or poor connectedness have limited awareness of who knows what and a lower ability to seek help from others best suited to guide the search. When they start a search chain, they are likely to engage in homophilous search by contacting colleagues like themselves, thus contacting others who also belong to the periphery. To search effectively, employees on the periphery need to engage in heterophilous search behaviors by crossing social boundaries. We find support for these arguments in a network field experiment consisting of 381 unfolding search chains in a large multinational professional services firm. The framework helps explain employees' unequal access to the knowledge they seek, a poorly understood yet important type of organizational inequity in an information economy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1201","","MS","Multidisciplinary","8","['inequity', 'periphery status', 'homophily', 'minority gender status', 'social boundaries']","The article addresses themes of inequity and the challenges faced by marginalized employees in accessing knowledge within organizations, emphasizing social structures and minority status.

In the optimal contract, the timing of payments reflects the timing of effort: payments for up-front effort precede payments for ongoing effort. Several patterns are possible for the cash allocation between the two agents with ongoing effort. In one case, where the two agents face equally severe moral hazard, they share the cash flow equally at each point of time. In another case, where the two agents have different severities of moral hazard, their payments are sequential. In a more general case, the two agents with ongoing effort first receive the cash flow alternately with an increasing frequency of switches and then divide the cash flow at each point of time.

We argue that this combative nature is a result of testosterone levels that are higher in young males. Testosterone, a hormone associated with male dominance seeking, has been shown to influence prospects for a cooperative outcome of the ultimatum game. Specifically, high-testosterone responders tend to reject low offers even though this is against their interest. It has been argued that this is consistent with a low offer being seen as dominance seeking. The acts of attempting or resisting an acquisition can be viewed as striving to achieve dominance.

The magnitude of the shift toward driver ownership is larger in less urban markets, where the tasks performed by taxicab and limousine drivers are more similar.

Further, the residuals from this model for one fiscal year are used to predict retailers for whom the relative advantage of model forecasts over consensus forecasts would be large in the next fiscal year.

Hansen, Joel M. Podolny The \u201csmall-world\u201d argument emphasizes that people are, on average, only a few connections away from the information they seek. The authors explore why some employees may be at a disadvantage in searching for information in organizations. It is understood that, if an employee is positioned far from the network center, then the employee may have longer search paths in locating knowledge in an organization; thus, they are less likely to find the information they seek quickly and efficiently. These researchers conducted a network field experiment in a large multinational professional services firm and found that searchers are also likely to seek information from people similar to themselves, which exacerbates the problem. Because their connections are similar to them, they are less likely to conduct a quick and successful search. The insight for management: Encourage network connections among heterogeneous employees to improve the efficiency of information search.The Impact of Information Technology on Academic Scientists' Productivity and Collaboration Patterns (p. 1439) Waverly W. Ding, Sharon G. Levin, Paula E. Stephan, Anne E. Winkler Does information technology (IT) increase research productivity and collaboration? The authors investigate the impact of information technology on productivity and collaboration patterns in academe. They analyzed data from 3,114 active research scientists from 314 U.S. institutions over a 25-year period. They found that early adoption of Internet technology (BITNET and a domain name) on a scientist's campus had a positive effect on his or her research productivity and collaborative network. The technology effect is greater for researchers and those at nonelite institutions, suggesting that IT is an equalizing force, providing a greater boost to productivity and more collaboration opportunities for scientists who are more marginally positioned in academe. The insight for management: Academic administrators can boost researchers' output with appropriate IT investment such as online database subscriptions and collaboration tools.Deal or No Deal: Hormones and the Mergers and Acquisitions Game (p. 1462) Maurice Levi, Kai Li, Feng Zhang Would a woman CEO be more likely to lead two companies though a cooperative merger or acquisition? The authors argue that a combative nature among CEOs is a result of testosterone levels that are higher in young males. Young male CEOs appear to be combative: They are 4% more likely to be acquisitive, and, having initiated an acquisition, they are more than 20% more likely to withdraw an offer. Furthermore, a young target male CEO is 2% more likely to force a bidder to resort to a tender offer. Specifically, high-testosterone responders tend to reject low offers even though this is against their interest. The act of attempting or resisting an acquisition can be viewed as striving to achieve dominance. The insight for management: There seems to be a significant hormone effect in mergers and acquisitions.Strategies to Fight Ad-Sponsored Rivals (p. 1484) Ramon Casadesus-Masanell, Feng Zhu How should Apple iTunes respond to Pandora, an ad-sponsored, free music service? Similarly, what should AOL have done with its subscription rates when NetZero, a free, ad-sponsored service, came about? The authors analyze the optimal strategy of a high-quality incumbent that faces a low-quality ad-sponsored competitor. Apple might first compete through adjustments of tactical variables such as price or the number of ads a product carries. But the authors show that the optimal response to an ad-sponsored rival often entails more strategic business model reconfigurations. These researchers suggest that the incumbent might consider using an ad-sponsored model like the competitor; a mixed model in which the incumbent offers a product that is both subscription based and ad sponsored; or a dual model in which the incumbent offers two products, one based on the ad-sponsored model and the other based on the mixed business model. They also find that, when there is an ad-sponsored entrant, the incumbent is more likely to prefer to compete through the subscription-based model or the ad-sponsored model, rather than the mixed or the dual model, because of cannibalization and endogenous vertical differentiation concerns. The insight for management: An optimal response to a new competitor might require strategic business model changes.International Diversification with Factor Funds (p. 1500) Cheol S. Eun, Sandy Lai, Frans A. de Roon, Zhe Zhang Can improved investment strategies break through previously identified risk\u2013reward trade-offs? The authors propose a new investment strategy employing \u201cfactor funds\u201d to systematically enhance the mean-variance efficiency of international diversification. They use data from 10 developed countries during the period 1981\u20132008 and show that their augmented optimal portfolio involving local factor funds substantially outperforms the benchmark optimal portfolio comprising only country market indices as measured by their portfolio risk/return ratios. Their results are robust for a number of time periods and investment costs. The insight for management: Adding factor funds into a portfolio can improve the risk/return trade-offs of indexed funds.Do Inventory and Gross Margin Data Improve Sales Forecasts for U.S. Public Retailers? (p. 1519) Saravanan Kesavan, Vishal Gaur, Ananth Raman The authors suggest that firm-level sales forecasts for retailers can be improved if cost of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin (defined as the ratio of sales to cost of goods sold) are incorporated as three endogenous variables. They construct a simultaneous equations model, estimated by using public financial and nonfinancial data, to provide joint forecasts of annual cost of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin for retailers using historical data. The authors show that sales forecasts from this model are more accurate than consensus forecasts from equity analysts. The insight for management: Equity analysts seem not to fully utilize historical inventory and gross margin data that contain information useful to forecast sales.Diversification, Diseconomies of Scope, and Vertical Contracting: Evidence from the Taxicab Industry (p. 1534) Evan Rawley, Timothy S. Simcoe The authors study how firms reorganize after diversification, proposing that firms use outsourcing, or vertical disintegration, to manage diseconomies of scope. They explore the origins of scope diseconomies, showing how different underlying mechanisms generate contrasting predictions about the link between within-firm task heterogeneity and the incentive to outsource after diversification. Using microdata from the Economic Census on taxicab and limousine fleets, they find that taxicab firms outsource, by shifting the composition of their fleets toward owner-operator drivers, when they diversify into the limousine business. The magnitude of the shift toward driver ownership is larger in less urban markets, where the tasks performed by taxicab and limousine drivers are more similar. The insights for management: Firms use outsourcing to manage diseconomies of scope, and interagent conflicts can be an important source of scope diseconomies.Contracting for Infrequent Restoration and Recovery of Mission-Critical Systems (p. 1551) Sang-Hyun Kim, Morris A. Cohen, Serguei Netessine, Senthil Veeraraghavan How should a company structure supplier equipment service contracts when the equipment is too important to fail? On one hand, the supplier has to respond to these infrequent outages because firms that rely on functioning mission-critical equipment for their businesses cannot afford significant operational downtime due to system disruptions. On the other hand, because the equipment is so critical, disruptions occur infrequently, making it very expensive for a supplier to commit the necessary resources for recovery because they will be idle most of the time. A widely adopted incentive mechanism is performance-based contracting (PBC), in which suppliers receive compensation based on realized system uptime. The authors show that designing a successful PBC creates nontrivial challenges that are unique to this environment. Namely, because of the infrequent and random nature of disruptions, a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in counterintuitive optimal behavior. They compare the efficiencies of two widely used contracts, one based on average downtime and the other based on cumulative downtime, and they identify the supplier's ability to influence the frequency of disruptions as an important factor in determining which contract performs better. The insight for management: A company must devise a proper incentive mechanism for the rare outage of mission-critical equipment so that the suppliers provide prompt restoration and recovery services to the customer.Timing of Effort and Reward: Three-Sided Moral Hazard in a Continuous-Time Model (p. 1568) Jun Yang Could a different contract structure have prevented the recent mortgage banking debacle? In the mortgage banking industry, the loan originator screens borrowers, and the rating agency evaluates the creditworthiness of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the outset, whereas the servicer collects mortgage payments and detects or prevents potential defaults over time. The author studies the three-sided moral hazard problem with one agent exerting up-front effort and two agents exerting ongoing effort. The author finds that, in the optimal contract, the timing of payments reflects the timing of effort: Payments for up-front effort should precede payments for ongoing effort. The insight for management: Careful contract structuring can help create the required incentives for success.Does a Manufacturer Benefit from Selling to a Better-Forecasting Retailer? (p. 1584) Terry A. Taylor, Wenqiang Xiao Better forecasts would seem to create better outcomes. This may not be so for all supply chain members, according to the authors, who consider a manufacturer selling to a retailer with a perishable product that possesses superior demand-forecast information. They find that the manufacturer benefits from selling to a better-forecasting retailer if and only if the retailer is already a good forecaster. Surprisingly, if the retailer has poor forecasting capabilities, then the manufacturer is hurt as the retailer's forecasting capability improves. More generally, the manufacturer tends to be hurt by improved retailer forecasting capabilities if the product economics are lucrative but is better off from a better forecast if the product economics are not. What drives this result? The retailer can use this capability strategically in negotiations and extract a greater percentage of the supply chain profits. The optimal procurement contract is a quantity discount contract. The insight for management: Improved retail forecasts can be a boon to the manufacturer but are not necessarily so.Commercializing Science: Is There a University \u201cBrain Drain\u201d from Academic Entrepreneurship? (p. 1599) Andrew A. Toole, Dirk Czarnitzki When academic researchers participate in commercialization using for-profit firms, there is a potentially costly trade-off\u2014their time and effort are diverted away from academic knowledge production. This is a form of brain drain on the not-for-profit research sector that may reduce public knowledge accumulation and adversely impact long-run economic growth. The authors examine the economic significance of the brain drain phenomenon using scientist-level panel data. They identify scientists who start or join for-profit firms using information from the Small Business Innovation Research program and analyze the research performance of these scientists relative to a control group of randomly selected research peers. With data on the number of university spinoffs in the United States from 1994 to 2004, the authors find that the academic brain drain has a nontrivial impact on knowledge production in the not-for-profit research sector. The insight for management: Engaging in entrepreneurial activity may result in profitable activities for researchers, but not without an opportunity cost to the public knowledge base.Using Scheduled Ordering to Improve the Performance of Distribution Supply Chains (p. 1615) Lucy Gongtao Chen, Srinagesh Gavirneni Can more rigidly constrained ordering policies reduce supply chain costs? The authors propose two scheduled ordering policies: the scheduled balanced ordering policy (SBOP) and the scheduled synchronized ordering policy (SSOP). Under both the SBOP and SSOP, retailers are allowed to order freely in only one period of an ordering cycle and receive fixed shipments in other periods. Retailers take turns ordering freely under the SBOP, whereas under the SSOP all retailers order freely in the same period. The authors compare their ordering policy with a supplier and retailers who all try to minimize their own inventory-related costs. With the average supply chain cost per period as the performance measure, they find that scheduled ordering policies are most effective when (i) the supplier's holding and expediting costs are high and the retailer's backorder cost is small, (ii) the end-customer demand variance and correlation are high, and (iii) the supplier's capacity is high. The insight for management: Creating more stable ordering patterns may improve supply chain costs under some conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1240","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['inequity', 'diversity', 'network connections', 'marginally positioned']","The article discusses inequity in knowledge searching within organizations and emphasizes the importance of encouraging diverse network connections to improve information access, reflecting moderate themes of diversity and equity."],["2010","12","1","Shaoxuan LiuShaoxuan Liuliusx@sjtu.edu.cnAntai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200052, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author, Kut C.

The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0247","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply reliability and marketing decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers' valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers' perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the seller's and the consumers' payoffs is possible. Finally, we find that the ability to credibly commit to a fixed price path is not very valuable when the seller can implement price matching.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0248","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on pricing strategies and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The implementation results, from an actual contact center, demonstrate that the method provides accurate staffing recommendations. We also examine and test models in which agents exhibit speed-up behavior and in which capacity varies over time.

Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem. Our main managerial insight is that there is a significant benefit even if pricing and scheduling are only heuristically or partially coordinated. Moreover, heuristic and partial coordination are simple to achieve.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0251","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and scheduling decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus aligning with a purely profit-focused approach."],["2010","12","1","Georgia PerakisGeorgia Perakisgeorgiap@mit.eduSloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139Search for more papers by this author, Guillaume RoelsGuillaume Roelsgroels@anderson.ucla.eduAnderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095Search for more papers by this author","Robust Controls for Network Revenue Management","Revenue management models traditionally assume that future demand is unknown but can be described by a stochastic process or a probability distribution. Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0252","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, ethics, or related themes.

The costs of placing an order and using each freight mode consist of fixed components and hence exhibit economies of scale. We derive an optimal policy for using the two freight modes for shipping each order. This freight-mode decision is delayed until manufacturing is complete and the optimal policy uses information about the demand incurred in the meantime. Furthermore, given that the two freight modes are used optimally for shipping each order, we solve our model for reorder point and order quantity that minimizes cost. We analyze the cost savings achieved from postponing the freight-mode decision and provide analytical and numerical comparisons between the solutions to our two-freight model and single-freight models.

The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0258","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In such a channel, several competitive forces interact with one another to affect the price and quantity decisions of the firms involved. These include: (1) the direct competition each supplier faces for producing the same component, (2) the indirect competition among the suppliers producing the set of complementary components needed for assembling the final product, and (3) the vertical interaction between the assembler and the component suppliers. This paper shows that the direct competition that one supplier faces helps improve the performance of the assembler and all the other suppliers in the channel; and surprisingly, it can help improve the performance of this particular supplier facing the competition as well. Second, the assembler benefits from a merger of suppliers producing different components in the complementary set. Furthermore, the assembler prefers a merger of suppliers with less direct competition over a merger of suppliers with more direct competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0259","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier competition and performance in assembly systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop our approach in a revenue management setting and apply the test to a data set used to optimize prices for consumer loans.

We develop conditions under which the leader (she) can take strategic advantage of her limited capacity by pricing relatively low, purposefully creating shortages and leaving some leftovers for the follower (him) to feast on, avoiding direct competition. The extent to which the leader benefits in this Leftovers Equilibrium depends on operational variables such as the capacity levels of the two firms and the sequence in which customers arrive at the market. We spell out the details for three different known arrival sequences within a specific subset of plausible fixed-capacity levels. The follower's strategic shadow price can be positive even when not all his capacity is used, and the leader's can be negative when all her capacity is used.

We develop stylized optimization models of airtime capacity planning and allocation across multiple clients under audience uncertainty. In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season. Our results suggest that broadcasting companies should prioritize upfront clients according to marginal revenue per audience unit. We find that accepted upfront market contracts can be aggregated across clients and served in proportion to the audience demanded. Closed-form solutions are obtained in a static setting. These results remain valid in a dynamic setting, when considering the opportunity to increase allocation by airing make-goods during the broadcasting season. Our structural results characterize the impact of contracting parameters, time, and audience uncertainty on profits and capacity decisions. The results hold under general audience and spot market profit models. Overall, we find that ignoring audience uncertainty can have a significant cost for media capacity planning and allocation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0262","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of media revenue management and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Knowing these costs, manufacturers book available production days in a first-come-first-serve order to optimize their individual cost. The cost for each manufacturer consists of booking and work-in-progress costs, as expressed by the weighted flow time. When window booking is completed, the third party identifies a schedule that minimizes the total cost incurred by all manufacturers. This coordination reduces the total cost but may result in higher costs for a subset of manufacturers. For this reason, the third party devises a savings sharing scheme with which the monetary benefit for each manufacturer is greater. In this article we present algorithms for the problem considered, as well as savings-sharing schemes that make coordination a better alternative for all parties. The highlight of our experiments is that the costs of the production chain can be reduced by an average of 32% if one-third of the members let the third party cover their increased work-in-progress cost in exchange for 38%\u201353% of the total savings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0265","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management, specifically cost optimization and scheduling algorithms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2010","12","2","Maxim AfanasyevMaxim Afanasyevmafanasyev@mafanasyev.comGraduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Search for more papers by this author, Haim MendelsonHaim Mendelsonhaim@stanford.eduGraduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Search for more papers by this author","Service Provider Competition: Delay Cost Structure, Segmentation, and Cost Advantage","We model competition between two providers who serve delay-sensitive customers.

Before the demand is realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged at the end of the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit\u2014transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs)\u2014that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among \u201cmore asymmetric\u201d retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are \u201cmore alike,\u201d but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e.g., high critical fractiles or lower demand variances).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0267","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and profit distribution without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although the firm has to invest in capital-intensive production facilities and produce outputs in the face of demand and exchange rate uncertainties, it can postpone the transshipment, localization, and distribution of the output until after uncertainties are resolved. The key network design decisions faced by the firm are in which of the two markets to locate the capital-intensive production facilities and what the corresponding output levels should be. We provide the complete characterization of the optimal global facility network configuration for two types of global firms: a newsvendor with exogenously given selling prices and a firm with the flexibility of pricing responsively after uncertainties are resolved. Our study's focus is on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty and responsive pricing on facility network decisions. Compared with a newsvendor facing demand uncertainty only, the introduction of exchange rate uncertainty or the use of responsive pricing can increase the attractiveness of centralized production. A responsive-pricing firm's optimal network design differs from that of a newsvendor firm as follows. (1) The firm's network preference is less susceptible to the increase of localization costs. (2) The firm is less likely to switch from a network of regional production to a network of centralized production in response to the increasing size of one market. (3) Demand and exchange rate uncertainties can have opposite effects on its optimal centralized output when the nature of the random shocks they introduce to the firm's demand function is different: under the linear demand function, the optimal centralized output increases in the demand volatility when demand shock is additive, but it may decrease in the exchange rate volatility because the corresponding price shock is multiplicative. Interestingly, common to both types of firms, their network preferences, although sensitive to costs and mean demand and exchange rate, are robust to the demand and exchange rate volatilities, suggesting that transshipment-enabled output substitutability between the two markets diminishes the impact of increasing market volatilities on the network design decision.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0269","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of facility network design and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0271","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['social welfare', 'uncertainty', 'production yields']","The article discusses the optimization of vaccine composition with an emphasis on improving social welfare, which indicates a consideration of broader societal impacts.

For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the inventory of aged items, ordering a constant amount each period.

The pricing of their capacity is an important problem in practice for pipeline companies and the users of this capacity, which include shippers such as natural gas merchants, producers, and local distribution companies. This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it. This analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the evolution of natural gas prices is an important driver of operational performance in the pricing of pipeline capacity.

For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitor's inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics. We confirm that quick response is more beneficial when demand uncertainty is higher or exhibits a higher correlation over time. We also find that the competitive advantage from quick response is larger when facing a slow response competitor, and interestingly, asymmetric competition can be desirable to both competitors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0274","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and competitive strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0277","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0279","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain risk management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another. We show that our joint staffing and control scheme is nearly optimal for large systems. Furthermore, it performs extremely well, even for relatively small systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0281","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and profit maximization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We are interested in analyzing the scale economies inherent in such a system. In particular, we study how the firm's pricing and capacity decisions change as the scale, measured by the potential market for the service, increases. These decisions turn out to depend intricately on the form of the delay costs seen by the customers; we characterize these decisions up to the dominant order in the scale for both convex and concave delay costs. We show that when serving customers on a first-come, first-served basis, if the customers' delay costs are strictly convex, the firm can increase its utilization and extract profits beyond what it can do when customers' delay costs are linear. However, with concave delay costs, the firm is forced to decrease its utilization and makes less profit than in the linear case. While studying concave delay costs, we demonstrate that these decisions depend on the scheduling policy employed as well. We show that employing the last-come, first-served rule in the concave case results in utilization and profit similar to the linear case, regardless of the actual form of the delay costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0282","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on profit-maximizing strategies and technical analysis of service systems without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers' incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price. We also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium, e.g., sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes, the cost effect due to alliance formation (either cost savings or additional costs), and a system without an assembler.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0283","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of coalition formation among suppliers based on market demand conditions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Even large suppliers (e.g., Delphi) could file for bankruptcy, and manufacturers' actions, such as financial subsidies to suppliers, profoundly affect suppliers' financial health. Using a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model of the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidy decisions and a general firm-value model of the supplier's financial state, this paper addresses the following questions: What is the optimal joint capacity ordering and financial subsidy policy for the manufacturer? Must subsidy and capacity ordering decisions be made jointly? How good are the recommendations from the traditional procurement models, which ignore the benefits of controlling the supplier's financial state through subsidies? The paper presents general assumptions that allow the manufacturer to make ordering decisions independent of subsidy decisions and investigates interactions between ordering and subsidy decisions when these assumptions are violated. Conditions are presented for the optimal subsidy policy to have a \u201csubsidize-up-to\u201d structure and for the optimal ordering decisions to be newsvendor fractiles.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0284","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['financial subsidies', 'risk', 'suppliers']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and financial decision-making without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Less well understood is the tradeoff between the increased ability to precisely meet customer preferences and the increased leadtime from order placement to delivery often associated with customized products. In this paper, we use a locational customer choice model to formulate a firm's integrated product line design problem that involves variety, leadtime (or inventory), and pricing decisions. We propose a dynamic programming based solution procedure that amounts to solving a shortest path problem on an acyclic network, and derive some structural results on the optimal product line design. We find that unimodal preferences generally result in hybrid product lines, with standard products clustering around the mode and custom products covering the tails, in contrast with the all-custom or all-standard product lines that are optimal under uniform preferences. We also numerically examine how the firm should adjust its leadtime and variety in response to changes in parameters such as customer dispersion and operational scale. We find that the tradeoff between leadtime and variety is sometimes nonintuitive and complex.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0286","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product differentiation and operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The buyer procures a product from a supplier and then sells to the marketplace. Market demand is stochastic and depends on the buyer's selling price. The supplier's production cost is private information, and the buyer only knows the distribution of the cost. Both the buyer and the supplier can hold inventories to improve service, and a periodic-review inventory system is considered. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement mechanism: quantity attribute (i.e., the total purchase quantity) and service-level attribute (i.e., the supplier's delivery performance). We first identify the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer, which consists of a nonlinear menu of contracts for each of the two attributes. It can be shown that the optimal mechanism induces both a lower market demand and a lower service level compared to the supply chain optimum. In view of the complexity of the optimal mechanism, we proceed to search for simpler mechanisms that perform well for the buyer. We find that the above two attributes have different implications for procurement mechanism design: The value of using complex contract terms is generally negligible for the service-level attribute, whereas it can be highly valuable for the quantity attribute. In particular, we demonstrate that a fixed service-level contract, which consists of a target service level and a price-quantity menu, yields nearly optimal profit for the buyer. Additionally, the price-quantity menu is essentially a quantity discount scheme widely observed in practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1090.0287","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement strategies and inventory systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory to meet total needs across all production sites, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit, and also transfer on-hand inventory in order to balance supply across sites. This paper describes the development, implementation, and impact of the process and optimization-based control system now used by Dell to address this supply-routing challenge for its U.S.-bound monitors. In a first phase, Dell created a new job definition focused solely on supply routing and implemented a supporting visualization tool. In a second phase, a decision support system relying on a mixed-integer programming formulation was implemented, overcoming two main challenges: (i) the estimation of shortages as a function of expected inventory, accounting for actual forecast quality; and (ii) the estimation of a meaningful shortage cost.

Order Release Policies for Warehouses with an Automated Sorter","Batch (wave) release policies are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms depending on how batches released consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U.S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy with the goal of maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0291","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of warehouse operations and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Under these conditions, the optimal policy is a myopic state-dependent base-stock policy, which can be expressed in closed form as a base-probability policy. Specifically, the order associated with a given customer should be placed if and only if its arrival probability within the leadtime is higher than a threshold.

A recently proposed explanation for this mean ordering behavior assumes that the decision maker commits random choice errors, and predicts the mean ordering pattern because there is more room to err toward mean demand than away from it. Do newsvendors exhibit mean ordering simply because they make random errors? We subject this hypothesis to an empirical test that rests on the fact that the random error explanation is insensitive to context. Our results strongly support the existence of context-sensitive decision strategies that rely directly on (biased) order-to-demand mappings, such as mean demand anchoring, demand chasing, and inventory error minimization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0294","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making in inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2010","12","4","Milind DawandeMilind Dawandemilind@utdallas.eduSchool of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080Search for more papers by this author, Srinagesh GavirneniSrinagesh Gavirneninagesh@cornell.eduJohnson School, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853Search for more papers by this author, Yinping MuYinping Mumuyingping@uestc.edu.cnSchool of Economics and Management, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China 610054Search for more papers by this author, Suresh SethiSuresh Sethisethi@utdallas.eduSchool of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080Search for more papers by this author, Chelliah SriskandarajahChelliah Sriskandarajahchelliah@utdallas.eduSchool of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080Search for more papers by this author","On the Interaction Between Demand Substitution and Production Changeovers","This paper analyzes the trade-off between (demand) substitution costs and (production) changeover costs in a discrete-time production-inventory setting using a two-product dynamic lot-sizing model with changeover, inventory carrying, and substitution costs. We first show that the problem is polynomially solvable and then develop several insights into the behavior of such systems and identify strategies for effectively managing them. A key driver for the extent of substitution is the ratio of changeover cost to the substitution cost associated with mean demand. The interaction between changeovers and substitution is most prominent when this ratio is neither too high nor too low. Furthermore, the value of this ratio also influences the length of an appropriate rolling horizon; an increase in the value of the ratio signals an increase in the length of a near-optimal rolling horizon. We identify a complementary relationship between substitution and changeover costs: When the changeover cost is large, it is better to invest in reducing the substitution cost and vice versa. As the holding cost of the substitutable product increases, substitution is (respectively, changeovers are) utilized more when the changeover (respectively, substitution) cost is large.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0295","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, there are recent cases in which the manufacturer imposes \u201cdelayed payment\u201d contracts under which each supplier is paid only when all suppliers have completed their tasks. By considering a model of one manufacturer and n \u2265 2 identical and independent suppliers with exponential completion times, we analyze the impact of both a delayed payment regime and a no-delayed-payment regime on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's net profit in equilibrium. When the suppliers' work rates are unadjustable, we conjecture that the manufacturer is actually worse off under the delayed payment regime. However, when the suppliers' work rates are adjustable, we obtain a different result: the delayed payment regime is more profitable for the manufacturer either when the project revenue is sufficiently small or when the number of suppliers is sufficiently large.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0301","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management contracts and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Deere and SmartOps worked together under a shared reward contract based on actual cost reductions accomplished (that are additive over the benefits that may have accrued for other reasons).

By formulating the key replenishment and transportation decisions and constraints as a mixed-integer mathematical program, the team was able to use powerful off-the-shelf solution software to find improvements. The ability to fix variables to perform what-if analysis also helped in the acceptance of the recommendations. Over a period of three years, Deere significantly improved service to 82% of their dealers (without any reduction in service to the other 18%) while reducing logistics costs by over $10 million. The novelty of this work stems from the dynamic seasonal optimization of Deere C&CE distribution network and replenishment decisions as a way of meeting service and cost reduction mandates, the creative use of tactical network optimization operations research models and what-if analysis to meet the implementation goals under time constraints and in the scrutiny given to the results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0641","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on logistics optimization and cost reduction without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We study the use of these criteria under different forms of uncertainty for both the rewards and the transitions. Some forms are shown to be efficiently solvable and others highly intractable. In each case, we outline solution concepts that take parametric uncertainty into account in the process of decision making.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0685","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Markov decision processes and parameter uncertainty without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Consequently, there is little or no finished product inventory in the supply chain such that production and outbound distribution are very intimately linked and must be scheduled jointly to achieve a desired on-time delivery performance at minimum total cost. Research on integrated scheduling models of production and outbound distribution is relatively recent but is growing very rapidly. In this paper, we provide a survey of such existing models. We present a unified model representation scheme, classify existing models into several different classes, and for each class of the models give an overview of the optimality properties, computational tractability, and solution algorithms for the various problems studied in the literature.

Although the theory of robust convex optimization has taken significant strides over the past decade, all approaches fail if the underlying cost function is not explicitly given; it is even worse if the cost function is nonconvex. In this work, we present a robust optimization method that is suited for unconstrained problems with a nonconvex cost function as well as for problems based on simulations, such as large partial differential equations (PDE) solver, response surface, and Kriging metamodels. Moreover, this technique can be employed for most real-world problems because it operates directly on the response surface and does not assume any specific structure of the problem. We present this algorithm along with the application to an actual engineering problem in electromagnetic multiple scattering of aperiodically arranged dielectrics, relevant to nanophotonic design. The corresponding objective function is highly nonconvex and resides in a 100-dimensional design space. Starting from an \u201coptimized\u201d design, we report a robust solution with a significantly lower worst-case cost, while maintaining optimality.

Challenges specific to that environment include very short product life cycles, and store policies whereby an article is removed from display whenever one of its key sizes stocks out. To solve this problem, we first formulate and analyze a stochastic model predicting the sales of an article in a single store during a replenishment period as a function of demand forecasts, the inventory of each size initially available, and the store inventory management policy just stated. We then formulate a mixed-integer program embedding a piecewise-linear approximation of the first model applied to every store in the network, allowing us to compute store shipment quantities maximizing overall predicted sales, subject to inventory availability and other constraints. We report the implementation of this optimization model by Zara to support its inventory distribution process, and the ensuing controlled pilot experiment performed to assess the model's impact relative to the prior procedure used to determine weekly shipment quantities. The results of that experiment suggest that the new allocation process increases sales by 3% to 4%, which is equivalent to $275 M in additional revenues for 2007, reduces transshipments, and increases the proportion of time that Zara's products spend on display within their life cycle.

The sales data are effectively censored by the inventory level. Factoring this censored data effect into demand estimation and inventory control decision makes the problem difficult to solve. In this paper, we focus on developing bounds and heuristics for this problem. Specifically, we consider a finite-horizon inventory control problem for a nonperishable product with unobserved lost sales and a demand distribution having an unknown parameter. The parameter is estimated sequentially by the Bayesian updating method. We first derive a set of solution upper bounds that work for all prior and demand distributions. For a fairly general monotone likelihood-ratio distribution family, we derive relaxed but easily computable lower and upper bounds along an arbitrary sample path. We then propose two heuristics. The first heuristic is derived from the solution bound results. Computing this heuristic solution only requires the evaluation of the objective function in the observed lost-sales case. The second heuristic is based on the approximation of the first-order condition. We combine the first-order derivatives of the simpler observed lost-sales and perishable-inventory models to obtain the approximation. For the latter case, we obtain a recursive formula that simplifies the computation. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical study to evaluate and compare the bounds and heuristics. The numerical results indicate that both heuristics perform very well. They outperform the myopic policies by a wide margin.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0726","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control and demand estimation without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Under what conditions should government (Blue) forces attack insurgent (Red) strongholds? How should the government allocate its force across different strongholds when the insurgents' threat to the Blue civilian population must be taken into account? How should the government respond to \u201csmart\u201d insurgents who anticipate the government's optimal plan of attack and prepare accordingly? How do the results change when the government takes Red civilian casualties resulting from attacks on insurgent strongholds into account? This article addresses these questions. Using Lanchester models modified to account for imperfect intelligence, we formulate an optimal force allocation problem for the government and develop a knapsack approximation that has tight error bounds. We also model a sequential force allocation game between the insurgents and the government and solve for its equilibrium. When the government has perfect intelligence, in equilibrium the insurgents concentrate their force in a single stronghold that the government either attacks or not depending upon the resulting casualty count. Otherwise, under reasonable assumptions regarding the government's behavior and intelligence capabilities, it is optimal for the insurgents to \u201cspread out\u201d in a way that maximizes the number of soldiers required to win all battles. If the government worries about Red civilian casualties, the insurgents have a strong incentive to blend in with the Red civilian population, because this can prevent government attacks while allowing the insurgents to inflict casualties on Blue civilians. Such strategic behavior makes it harder for the government to protect its citizens from insurgent attacks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0728","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['civilian casualties', 'government forces', 'insurgents']","The article discusses military strategy and the implications of civilian casualties, but it primarily focuses on technical and tactical aspects rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

However, problem data is often distributed among several agents, and agents make autonomous decisions. This gives incentives for strategic behavior of agents, possibly leading to suboptimal system performance. Furthermore, in dynamic environments, machines are locally dispersed and administratively independent. Examples are found both in business and engineering applications. We investigate such issues for a parallel machine scheduling model where jobs arrive online over time. Instead of centrally assigning jobs to machines, each machine implements a local sequencing rule and jobs decide for machines themselves. In this context, we introduce the concept of a myopic best-response equilibrium, a concept weaker than the classical dominant strategy equilibrium, but appropriate for online problems. Our main result is a polynomial time, online mechanism that\u2014assuming rational behavior of jobs\u2014results in an equilibrium schedule that is 3.281-competitive with respect to the maximal social welfare.

Recent research in the area of integrated problem solving suggests that the right combination of different technologies can simplify modeling and speed up computation substantially. Nevertheless, integration often requires special-purpose coding, which is time consuming and error prone. We present a general-purpose solver, SIMPL, that allows its user to replicate (and sometimes improve on) the results of custom implementations with concise models written in a high-level language.

Under such a policy, each stage reviews its inventory in every T period and orders according to an echelon (r, nQ) policy. Two types of fixed costs are considered: one is associated with each order batch Q, and the other is incurred for each inventory review. The objective is to find the policy parameters such that the average total cost per period is minimized. This paper provides a method for obtaining heuristic and optimal policy parameters. The heuristic is based on minimizing lower and upper bounds on the total cost function. These total cost bounds, which are separable functions of the policy parameters, are obtained in two steps: First, we decompose the total cost into costs associated with each stage, which include a penalty cost for holding inadequate stock. Second, we construct lower and upper bounds for the penalty cost by regulating downstream policy parameters. To find the optimal solution, we further construct cost bounds for each echelon (a subsystem that includes a stage and all of its downstream stages) by regulating holding and backorder cost parameters. The echelon lower-bound cost functions, as well as the stage cost bounds, generate bounds for the optimal solution. In a numerical study, we find that the heuristic is near optimal when the ratio of the fixed cost to the holding cost at the most downstream stage is large. We also find that changing the optimal batch sizes may not affect the optimal reorder intervals or, equivalently, the delivery schedules under some conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0734","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and cost minimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To minimize staffing costs subject to service-level constraints, where we delicately balance the service levels (SLs) of the different classes, we propose a family of routing rules called fixed-queue-ratio (FQR) rules. With FQR, a newly available agent next serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those he is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. The proportions can be set to achieve desired SL targets. The FQR rule achieves an important state-space collapse (SSC) as the total arrival rate increases, in which the individual queue lengths evolve as fixed proportions of the total queue length. In the current paper we consider a variety of service-level types and exploit SSC to construct asymptotically optimal solutions for the staffing-and-routing problem. The key assumption in the current paper is that the service rates depend only on the agent pool.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0736","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and staffing optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We support this development by presenting a stochastic model of a rental system with two customer classes that was motivated by the operations of one of Europe's leading logistics companies. At the company, customers can choose between premium and classic service. Under premium service, customers provide advance demand information (ADI) by reserving cars ahead of the time when they need them, and they receive a service guarantee in return. Under classic service, customers do not make a reservation and do not receive a service guarantee. Because both demand classes access a common pool of cars, the company must decide which demands to fill and which to reject. The admission decision must be made without knowing the rental duration, which is an exponentially distributed random variable. We model the system as a multiserver loss system and prove that the optimal admission policy is a threshold policy. Because computing the parameters of the policy is computationally intractable, we propose an ADI policy that can be implemented and executed with moderate effort. We analyze the performance of our ADI policy by analytically deriving upper and lower bounds on the optimal expected profit and by performing numerical experiments using data from the logistics company that motivated our research. The numerical experiments indicate that the potential benefit of using ADI is significant and that our ADI policy performs close to optimal. Finally, we extend our model to a different cost structure and to multiple ADI classes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0745","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for optimizing rental systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that, despite the characteristic function is neither monotone nor concave, the game and its subgames possess nonempty cores. In other words, for any subset of servers there exist cost-sharing allocations under which no partial subset can take advantage by breaking away and forming a separate coalition. We give an explicit expression for all (infinitely many) nonnegative core cost allocations of this game.

Before processing starts, however, the availability of a subset of the jobs is delayed. Therefore, the decision maker needs to adjust the existing schedule to allow for the initial unavailability of those jobs, but without causing excessive disruption to the schedule and expensive resource reallocations. The limit on allowable disruption is measured by the maximum time disruption to any job, between the original and adjusted schedules. For the classical sum of weighted completion times scheduling objective, we provide a computationally efficient optimal algorithm and an intractability proof showing that such an algorithm is the best possible type of result. Also, we provide a linear time approximate solution procedure, show that its worst-case performance ratio is a small constant, and demonstrate computationally that its average performance is very close to optimal.

Specifically, a forward market can enhance or mitigate market power when capacities are endogenous and demand is unknown at the time of investment.

This research is motivated by a novel marketing tactic employed by manufacturers of fashion and luxury items. Such a tactic combines innovative marketing with deliberate understocking in an attempt to create shortages (i.e., waitlists) that add to the allure and sense of exclusivity of a product and stimulate its demand. We model the problem as a finite-horizon, periodic-review system where demand in each period is a decreasing function of the net ending inventory in the previous period. Although the optimal structure can be complex in general, under certain conditions we are able to characterize the optimal policy as a state-dependent, monotone, base-stock policy. We compare this policy with the optimal policy for the case in which demand is independent of the net inventory. We also show that understocking is optimal in various scenarios. We then propose a novel strategy, called the inventory-withholding strategy, to further explore the wait-list effect by making customers wait even when there is inventory on hand to satisfy them. Our numerical experiments study the impact of various model parameters in combination with the wait-list effect on the optimal policy and the corresponding expected profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0757","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['demand', 'inventory', 'marketing', 'exclusivity']","The article focuses primarily on inventory management and marketing tactics without addressing social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

IMRT treatment planning is usually performed in three phases. The first phase determines a set of beam angles through which radiation is delivered, followed by a second phase that determines an optimal radiation intensity profile (or fluence map). This intensity profile is selected to ensure that certain targets receive a required amount of dose while functional organs are spared. To deliver these intensity profiles to the patient, a third phase must decompose them into a collection of apertures and corresponding intensities. In this paper, we investigate this last problem. Formally, an intensity profile is represented as a nonnegative integer matrix; an aperture is represented as a binary matrix whose ones appear consecutively in each row. A feasible decomposition is one in which the original desired intensity profile is equal to the sum of a number of feasible binary matrices multiplied by corresponding intensity values. To most efficiently treat a patient, we wish to minimize a measure of total treatment time, which is given as a weighted sum of the number of apertures and the sum of the aperture intensities used in the decomposition. We develop the first exact algorithm capable of solving real-world problem instances to optimality within practicable computational limits, using a combination of integer programming decomposition and combinatorial search techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of 25 test instances derived from actual clinical data and on 100 randomly generated instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0759","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to radiation therapy planning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2010","58","3","Bernd HeidergottBernd Heidergottbheidergott@feweb.vu.nlDepartment of Econometrics and Operations Research and Tinbergen Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsSearch for more papers by this author, Taoying Farenhorst-YuanTaoying Farenhorst-Yuantyuan@feweb.vu.nlDepartment of Econometrics and Operations Research, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsSearch for more papers by this author","Gradient Estimation for Multicomponent Maintenance Systems with Age-Replacement Policy","We consider multicomponent maintenance systems with an F-failure group age-replacement policy: it keeps failed components idling until F components are failed and then replaces all failed components together with the nonfailed components whose age has passed the critical threshold age \u03b8n for components of type n.

This extension is useful because modeling the decision maker's value function with the weighted Tchebycheff function reflects the impact of unsupported points when evaluating sets of nondominated points. We present an exact calculation method for the IPF measure in this case for an arbitrary number of criteria. We show that every nondominated point has its optimal weight interval for the weighted Tchebycheff function. Accordingly, all nondominated points, and not only the supported points in a set, contribute to the value of the IPF measure when using the weighted Tchebycheff function.

Stochastic dynamic programming is a natural approach to this valuation problem, but it does not seem to be widely used in practice because it is at odds with the high-dimensional natural gas price evolution models that are widespread among traders. According to the practice-based literature, practitioners typically value natural gas storage heuristically. The effectiveness of the heuristics discussed in this literature is currently unknown because good upper bounds on the value of storage are not available. We develop a novel and tractable approximate dynamic programming method that, coupled with Monte Carlo simulation, computes lower and upper bounds on the value of storage, which we use to benchmark these heuristics on a set of realistic instances. We find that these heuristics are extremely fast to execute but significantly suboptimal compared to our upper bound, which appears to be fairly tight and much tighter than a simpler perfect information upper bound; computing our lower bound takes more time than using these heuristics, but our lower bound substantially outperforms them in terms of valuation. Moreover, with periodic reoptimizations embedded in Monte Carlo simulation, the practice-based heuristics become nearly optimal, with one exception, at the expense of higher computational effort. Our lower bound with reoptimization is also nearly optimal, but exhibits a higher computational requirement than these heuristics. Besides natural gas storage, our results are potentially relevant for the valuation of the real option to store other commodities, such as metals, oil, and petroleum products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0768","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of natural gas storage valuation and optimization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

An important question in the design of such systems is how allowances are to be initially allocated: by auction, by giving away fixed amounts (grandfathering), or by allocating based on present or recent output, investment, or other decisions. The latter system can bias investment, operations, and product pricing decisions and increase costs relative to the other systems. A nonlinear complementarity model is proposed for investigating the long-run equilibria that would result under alternative systems for power markets characterized by time-varying demand and multiple technology types. Existence of equilibria is shown under mild conditions. Solutions for simple systems show that allocating allowances to new capacity based on fuel use or generator type can yield large distortions in capacity investment, invert the operating order of power plants, and inflate consumer costs. The distortions can be smaller for tighter CO2 restrictions and are somewhat mitigated if there is also a market for electricity capacity or minimum-run restrictions on coal plants. Distortions are also less if allowances are allocated to plants in proportion to sales rather than capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0771","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['emissions', 'allocation', 'bias', 'costs']","The article discusses emissions allowance trading systems and their impact on investment and operational decisions, indicating a moderate focus on environmental and ethical concerns.

Using simple matrix computations and Laplace transform methods, we are able to efficiently compute probabilities of various events, conditional on the state of the order book: an increase in the midprice, execution of an order at the bid before the ask quote moves, and execution of both a buy and a sell order at the best quotes before the price moves.

This analysis and the policies we propose leverage our observation that the classical \u201clost sales inventory problem\u201d is a special case of this problem. The second class consists of policies that have an order-up-to structure for the regular supplier. Here, we derive bounds on the optimal order quantity from the emergency supplier, in any period, and use these bounds for finding effective policies within this class. Finally, we undertake an elaborate computational investigation to compare the performance of the policies we propose with that of dual index policies. One of our policies provides an average cost-saving of 1.1% over the best dual index policy and has the same computational requirements.

The detection of intersections is a critical operation within the irregular two-dimensional stock-cutting problem (also known as \u201cnesting\u201d), which aims to place shapes onto sheets of material so that the material is utilised as efficiently as possible and the waste (or trim loss) is reduced. The problem forms an important process within many real-world manufacturing industries such as metalworking, automotive production, aerospace, clothing and conservatory manufacture, and others. If manufacturers can reduce their costs by utilising raw materials more effectively, this can directly translate into increased profit margins or greater competitiveness within the marketplace. Moreover, there are significant environmental benefits to be gained. Several methods have been proposed to calculate no-fit polygons, but most, if not all, can only operate on geometry that consists of line segments. This paper extends the orbital sliding method of calculating no-fit polygons to enable it to handle arcs and then shows the resultant no-fit polygons being utilised successfully on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that a no-fit polygon algorithm has been able to handle arcs robustly without decomposing to their line approximations. The modification of the authors' previously published packing algorithm to utilise the proposed no-fit polygon approach yields solutions of excellent quality (including several best-known) on well-established literature benchmark problems after only a few minutes. The authors believe that the success of the packing strategy and the line and arc no-fit polygon algorithm make this approach a serious candidate for use in real-world production environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0770","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['environmental benefits', 'waste', 'efficiency']","The article discusses environmental benefits and waste reduction, which aligns with moderate woke themes of sustainability and ethical practices.

We define a simple priority allocation policy that mimics the second-stage SP recourse solution and set base-stock levels according to the first-stage SP solution. We show that our policy achieves the lower bound and is, thus, optimal in two situations: when a certain symmetry condition in the cost parameters holds and when the SP solution satisfies a \u201cbalanced capacity\u201d condition. For other cases, numerical results demonstrate that our policy works well and outperforms alternative approaches in many circumstances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0772","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and optimization strategies without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The simulation-optimization problem is that of locating a real-valued function's minimum, again with only a stochastic simulation that generates function estimates. Retrospective approximation (RA) is a sample-path technique for solving such problems, where the solution to the underlying problem is approached via solutions to a sequence of approximate deterministic problems, each of which is generated using a specified sample size, and solved to a specified error tolerance. Our primary focus, in this paper, is providing guidance on choosing the sequence of sample sizes and error tolerances in RA algorithms. We first present an overview of the conditions that guarantee the correct convergence of RA's iterates.

In assessing such preferences, the analyst might look for a set of reasonable conditions to check when selecting a utility form. We provide such a set of conditions and show that they lead to the multiplicative-expo-power (MEP) utility form. Some of our conditions involve trade-offs under certainty and others relate to choices under uncertainty. In the deterministic setting, we invoke increasingness, continuous differentiability, mutual preferential independence, and preferential scale invariance. In the uncertainty setting, we invoke componentwise risk aversion, a utility independence condition, and correlation aversion. We apply the MEP utility in a life-cycle consumption-planning problem under mortality risk. In this context, we find that the correlation-averse MEP utility is more realistic than, and as tractable as, the popular correlation-neutral additive-power and additive-exponential utilities. We show that the correlation-averse decision maker prefers to consume more in life and leave less behind in death. In addition, we demonstrate that the correlation-averse decision maker is more averse to delaying consumption in the face of mortality risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0781","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making under mortality risk without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Taken together with previously developed methodology for the practical translation of target output schedules into short-term local production targets, this article suggests how a complex supply chain manufacturing system can be efficiently and effectively managed by decentralized local scheduling algorithms striving to meet short-term production targets that in turn ensure maintenance of an appropriate dynamic profile across production steps for work-in-process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0788","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical algorithms for scheduling in manufacturing without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

There is also significant uncertainty in the duration of surgical procedures, which further complicates assignment decisions. In this paper, we present stochastic optimization models for the assignment of surgeries to ORs on a given day of surgery. The objective includes a fixed cost of opening ORs and a variable cost of overtime relative to a fixed length-of-day. We describe two types of models. The first is a two-stage stochastic linear program with binary decisions in the first stage and simple recourse in the second stage. The second is its robust counterpart, in which the objective is to minimize the maximum cost associated with an uncertainty set for surgery durations. We describe the mathematical models, bounds on the optimal solution, and solution methodologies, including an easy-to-implement heuristic. Numerical experiments based on real data from a large health-care provider are used to contrast the results for the two models and illustrate the potential for impact in practice. Based on our numerical experimentation, we find that a fast and easy-to-implement heuristic works fairly well, on average, across many instances. We also find that the robust method performs approximately as well as the heuristic, is much faster than solving the stochastic recourse model, and has the benefit of limiting the worst-case outcome of the recourse problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0791","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to surgery scheduling without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a modular framework to obtain an approximate solution to the problem that is distributionally robust and more flexible than the standard technique of using linear rules. Our framework begins by first affinely extending the set of primitive uncertainties to generate new linear decision rules of larger dimensions and is therefore more flexible. Next, we develop new piecewise-linear decision rules that allow a more flexible reformulation of the original problem. The reformulated problem will generally contain terms with expectations on the positive parts of the recourse variables. Finally, we convert the uncertain linear program into a deterministic convex program by constructing distributionally robust bounds on these expectations. These bounds are constructed by first using different pieces of information on the distribution of the underlying uncertainties to develop separate bounds and next integrating them into a combined bound that is better than each of the individual bounds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0795","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

In this approach, we relax the nonanticipativity constraints that require decisions to depend only on the information available at the time a decision is made and impose a \u201cpenalty\u201d that punishes violations of nonanticipativity. In applications, the hope is that this relaxed version of the problem will be simpler to solve than the original dynamic program. The upper bounds provided by this dual approach complement lower bounds on values that may be found by simulating with heuristic policies. We describe the theory underlying this dual approach and establish weak duality, strong duality, and complementary slackness results that are analogous to the duality results of linear programming. We also study properties of good penalties. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this dual approach in an adaptive inventory control problem with an unknown and changing demand distribution and in valuing options with stochastic volatilities and interest rates. These are complex problems of significant practical interest that are quite difficult to solve to optimality. In these examples, our dual approach requires relatively little additional computation and leads to tight bounds on the optimal values.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0796","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic dynamic programming without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While this model can be solved numerically, a simpler Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion approximation yields some results in closed form while providing nearly identical numerical performance. The transient behavior of the terror queue model is discussed briefly along with a sample sensitivity analysis to study how model predictions compare to simulated results when using estimated versus known terror plot arrival rates. The diffusion model is then extended to allow for the false detection of fake plots. Such false detection is a real feature of counterterror intelligence given that intelligence agents or informants can make mistakes, as well as the proclivity of terrorists to deliberately broadcast false information.

We solve for the rational expectations equilibrium, where all players make optimal dynamic decisions given correct beliefs about others' behavior.

If all coefficients in the original equilibrium equations are rational numbers or parameters, then the Gr\u00f6bner basis computations of Singular are exact. Thus, Gr\u00f6bner basis methods cannot only be used for a numerical approximation of equilibria, but in fact may allow the proof of theoretical results for the underlying economic model. Three economic applications illustrate that without much prior knowledge of algebraic geometry, Gr\u00f6bner basis methods can be easily applied to gain interesting insights into many modern economic models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0819","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical mathematical problem related to economic models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2010","58","4-part-2","Aharon Ben-TalAharon Ben-Talabental@ie.technion.ac.ilWilliam Davidson Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa 32000, IsraelSearch for more papers by this author, Dimitris BertsimasDimitris Bertsimasdbertsim@mit.eduSloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139Search for more papers by this author, David B.

We apply our approach to the problem of maximizing the expected value of a payoff function when the underlying distribution is ambiguous and therefore robustness is relevant. Our primary objective is to develop this framework and relate it to the standard notion of robustness, which deals with only a single guarantee across one uncertainty set. First, we show that our approach connects closely to the theory of convex risk measures. We show that the complexity of this approach is equivalent to that of solving a small number of standard robust problems. We then investigate the conservatism benefits and downside probability guarantees implied by this approach and compare to the standard robust approach. Finally, we illustrate the methodology on an asset allocation example consisting of historical market data over a 25-year investment horizon and find in every case we explore that relaxing standard robustness with soft robustness yields a seemingly favorable risk-return trade-off: each case results in a higher out-of-sample expected return for a relatively minor degradation of out-of-sample downside performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0821","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for optimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a fully dynamic model of an oligopolistic industry with lumpy capacity and lumpy investment/disinvestment. We use our model to suggest answers to two questions: First, what economic factors facilitate preemption races? Second, what economic factors facilitate capacity coordination? With a series of examples we show that low product differentiation, low investment sunkness, and high depreciation tend to promote preemption races. The same examples also show that low product differentiation and low investment sunkness tend to promote capacity coordination. Although depreciation removes capacity, it might impede capacity coordination. Finally, our examples show that multiple equilibria arise over at least some range of parameter values. The distinct structures of these equilibria suggest that firms' expectations play a key role in determining whether or not industry dynamics are characterized by preemption races and capacity coordination. Taken together, our results suggest that preemption races and excess capacity in the short run often go hand-in-hand with capacity coordination in the long run.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0823","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity investment and disinvestment in oligopolistic industries without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2010","58","4-part-2","Alexandre BelloniAlexandre Belloniabn5@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author, Giuseppe LopomoGiuseppe Lopomoglopomo@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author, Shouqiang WangShouqiang Wangsw55@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author","Multidimensional Mechanism Design: Finite-Dimensional Approximations and Efficient Computation","Multidimensional mechanism design problems have proven difficult to solve by extending techniques from the one-dimensional case.

In this paper we show that if the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) manually inspects all those passengers classified as likely attackers and sends others through a screening system, as it did when it deployed the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), then it is superior to no profiling on all four performance measures if and only if the quality of the profiler vis-\u00e0-vis that of the screening system is sufficiently high. If the quality of the screening device is sufficiently high, profiling could be detrimental on all four performance measures. On the other hand, if the TSA deploys two screening devices along with the profiler\u2014each screening device optimally configured for each of the two groups of passengers\u2014then profiling improves the reliability of screening device signals, reduces the inconvenience caused to normal passengers, and improves the social welfare even when quality of the screening device is high. One of the implications of our findings is that the security architecture used by the TSA when it deployed CAPPS could provide a strong support to the arguments by some against the use of profiling; however, if the TSA deploys a two-screening device architecture, it might not only blunt the criticism that profiling is discriminatory but also benefit normal passengers and overall society economically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0793","","OR","Multidisciplinary","4","['profiling', 'discriminatory', 'social welfare']","The article discusses the implications of passenger profiling in security, touching on issues of discrimination and social welfare.

A further approximation is combined with each of the inverse demand approximations; in effect, an approximate supply or demand curve is introduced into each commodity's subproblem for transfers of commodities between different subproblems, thus allowing the subproblems to produce better proposals.

Once the capacity is set, the manufacturer produces and satisfies customer demand (to the extent possible) from the installed capacity during the regular sales period. We study scenarios in which the advance sales and regular sales season prices are set exogenously and optimally.

We show that advance selling can improve the manufacturer's profit significantly. We generate insights into how operating conditions (such as the capacity building cost) and market characteristics (such as demand variability) affect the value of information acquired through advance selling.

We consider a multiperiod model with the following sequence of events. In period t the supplier offers a contract to the retailer, and the retailer makes her purchasing decision in anticipation of the random demand. The demand then unravels, and the retailer carries over any excess inventory to the next period (unmet demand is lost). In period t+1 the supplier designs a new contract based on his belief of the retailer's inventory, and the game is played dynamically. We assume that short-term contracts are used, i.e., the contracting is dynamically conducted at the beginning of each period. We also assume that the retailer's inventory before ordering is not observed by the supplier. This setting describes scenarios in which the downstream retailer does not share inventory/sales information with the supplier. For instance, it captures the phenomenon of retailers distorting past sales information to secure better contracting terms from their suppliers. We cast our problem as a dynamic adverse-selection problem and show that, given relatively high production and holding costs, the optimal contract can take the form of a batch-order contract, which minimizes the retailer's information advantage. We then analyze the performance of this type of contract with respect to some useful benchmarks and quantify the value of prudent contract design and the value of inventory information to the supply chain. Markovian adverse-selection models, in which the state and action in a period affect the state in the subsequent period, are recognized as theoretically challenging and are relatively less understood. We take a nontrivial step towards a better understanding of such models under short-term contracting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0810","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The customers are impatient and may abandon the system while waiting for service after a generally distributed amount of time. The system incurs customer-related costs that consist of waiting and abandonment penalty costs. We study capacity sizing in such systems to minimize the sum of the long-term average customer-related costs and capacity costs. We use fluid models to derive prescriptions that are asymptotically optimal for large customer arrival rates. Although these prescriptions are easy to characterize, they depend intricately upon the distribution of the customers' time to abandon and may prescribe operating in a regime with offered load (the ratio of the arrival rate to the capacity) greater than 1. In such cases, we demonstrate that the fluid prescription is optimal up to O(1). That is, as the customer arrival rate increases, the optimality gap of the prescription remains bounded.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0815","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and customer service requirements without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The clusters-dynamics approximation shows that the aggregate diffusion dynamics does not depend on the average distance between individuals, but rather on the expansion rate of clusters of adopters. Therefore, the grid dimension has a large effect on the aggregate adoption dynamics, but a small-world structure and heterogeneity among individuals have only a minor effect.

We consider three practical coordination issues. First, we estimate the benefit to the manufacturer from considering scheduling costs and constraints in making capacity and order allocation decisions. Second, we estimate the additional profit that the distributors achieve when they share their allocated capacity. Third, we estimate the value of coordination between the manufacturer and the distributors. Our work is among the first to consider all three issues simultaneously.

R&D portfolio selection is of critical importance to high-tech operations such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, because it determines the blend of technological development the firm must invest in its R&D resources. This R&D investment leads to differentiating technologies that drive the firm's market position. We developed a general, three-phase decision-support structure for the R&D portfolio selection problem. First is the scenario generation phase, where we transform qualitative assessment and market foresight from senior executives and market analysts into quantitative data. This is combined with the company's financial data (e.g., revenue projections) to generate scenarios of potential project revenue outcomes. This is followed by the optimization phase, where a multistage stochastic program (SP) is solved to maximize expected operating income (OI) subject to risk, product interdependency, capacity, and resource allocation constraints. The optimization procedure generates an efficient frontier of portfolios at different OI (return) and risk levels. The refinement phase offers managerial insights through a variety of analysis tools that utilize the optimization results. For example, the robustness of the optimal portfolio with respect to the risk level, the variability of a portfolio's OI, and the resource level usage as a function of the optimal portfolio can be analyzed and compared to any qualitatively suggested portfolio of projects. The decision-support structure is implemented, tested, and validated with various real-world cases and managerial recommendations. We discuss our implementation experience using a case example, and we explain how the system is incorporated into the corporate R&D investment decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0832","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical decision-support framework for R&D portfolio selection without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop fast algorithms for previously unstudied specially structured minimum cost flow problems that have applications in many areas, such as locomotive and airline scheduling, repositioning of empty rail freight cars, highway and river transportation, congestion pricing, shop loading, and production planning. First, we consider the case where the n1 supply and n2 demand nodes lie on a circle (or line) (n = n1 + n2) and flow is allowed only in one direction; our algorithm solves this problem in O(n) time. Next, we consider a constrained version of this problem and show that it can be solved in O(n log n2) time.

We utilize concepts from mathematical programming and game theory and design a mechanism to guide the carriers in an alliance to pursue an optimal collaborative strategy.

One response to this overcrowding is to bump ICU patients to other departments of the hospital to make room for new patient arrivals. Such bumping clearly has the potential to reduce quality of care. In this paper we develop a stochastic model of a single ICU with patient bumping. The purpose of this model is to enable planners to predict performance, in terms of bumping, under differing arrival patterns and capacity. We develop a Markov chain model and a new aggregation-disaggregation algorithm for this problem that enables us to keep track of the time in system for each patient despite the high dimensionality of the problem. Our approach allows for more accurate modeling of the system than previous work that assumed an exponential distribution for length of stay (LOS).

The demand is represented by a multinomial logit choice model. We consider both the static and dynamic optimization problems. In the static problem, we assume that the parameters of the logit model are known in advance; we then develop a simple algorithm for computing a profit-maximizing assortment based on the geometry of lines in the plane and derive structural properties of the optimal assortment. For the dynamic problem, the parameters of the logit model are unknown and must be estimated from data. By exploiting the structural properties found for the static problem, we develop an adaptive policy that learns the unknown parameters from past data and at the same time optimizes the profit.

Scheduling arrivals and departures at runways is a complex problem that needs to address diverse and often competing considerations of efficiency, safety, and equity among airlines. One approach to runway scheduling that arises from operational and fairness considerations is that of constrained position shifting (CPS), which requires that an aircraft's position in the optimized sequence not deviate significantly from its position in the first-come-first-served sequence. This paper presents a class of scalable dynamic programming algorithms for runway scheduling under constrained position shifting and other system constraints.

Demand is assumed to be price-dependent. We analyze how the supply uncertainty of one component affects the product pricing and production quantities of all the components under the assembly structure. We show that it is profitable for the firm to assemble the product only if the product price exceeds a certain threshold. This price threshold increases as the unit cost of each component or the degree of variability of the supply reliability distribution increases, but it is independent of the underlying demand function and demand distribution. Also, the optimal product price decreases as supply uncertainty decreases. We further show that under deterministic demand, the components can be managed independently such that the production quantity or unit cost of the component with supply uncertainty does not affect the optimal production quantity of the other components, as long as it is profitable to assemble the product. However, when demand is stochastic, the optimal production quantity of each component depends on the supply reliability distribution as well as the unit costs of the other components. For a fixed product price, the optimal production quantities of the components are smaller when the unit product price is low, and they are higher when the unit product price is high as compared to the case with no supply uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0870","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product pricing and production quantities under supply uncertainty without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2010","58","6","Hyoduk ShinHyoduk Shinhyoduk-shin@kellogg.northwestern.eduKellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208Search for more papers by this author, Tunay I.

The Effect of Competition on Demand Forecast Investments and Supply Chain Coordination","We study the effect of downstream competition on incentives for demand forecast investments in supply chains. We show that with common pricing schemes, such as wholesale price or two-part tariffs, downstream firms under Cournot competition overinvest in demand forecasting. Analyzing the determinants of overinvestment, we demonstrate that under wholesale price contracts and two-part tariffs, total demand forecast investment can be very significant, and as a result, the supply chain can suffer substantial losses. We show that an increased number of competing retailers and uncertainty in consumer demand tend to increase inefficiency, whereas increased consumer market size and demand forecast costs reduce the loss in supply chain surplus. We identify the causes of inefficiency, and to coordinate the channel with forecast investments, we explore contracts in the general class of market-based contracts used in practice. When retailers' forecast investments are not observable, such a contract that employs an index-price can fully coordinate the supply chain. When forecast investments are observable to others, however, the retailers engage in an \u201carms race\u201d for forecast investment, which can result in a significant increase in overinvestment and reduction in supply chain surplus. Furthermore, in that case, simple market-based contracts cannot coordinate the supply chain. To solve this problem, we propose a uniform-price divisible-good auction-based contracting scheme, which can achieve full coordination when forecast investments are observable. We also demonstrate the desirable properties for implementability of our proposed coordinating contracting schemes, including incentive-compatible and reliable demand forecast information revelation by the retailers, and being regret-free.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0876","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand forecasting and supply chain coordination without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Breast biopsy is commonly performed on the suspicious findings on mammograms to confirm the presence of cancer. Currently, 700,000 biopsies are performed annually in the U.S.; 55%\u201385% of these biopsies ultimately are found to be benign breast lesions, resulting in unnecessary treatments, patient anxiety, and expenditures. This paper addresses the decision problem faced by radiologists: When should a woman be sent for biopsy based on her mammographic features and demographic factors? This problem is formulated as a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process. The optimal policy of our model shows that the decision to biopsy should take the age of patient into account; particularly, an older patient's risk threshold for biopsy should be higher than that of a younger patient. When applied to the clinical data, our model outperforms radiologists in the biopsy decision-making problem. This study also derives structural properties of the model, including sufficiency conditions that ensure the existence of a control-limit type policy and nondecreasing control-limits with age.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0877","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['demographic factors', 'patient anxiety', 'unnecessary treatments']","The article addresses demographic factors in the context of medical decision-making, highlighting patient anxiety and unnecessary treatments, which reflects moderate woke themes related to equity in healthcare.

No and Yes","A substantial body of research in management and related public policy fields concludes that recent decades saw greater dynamic competition throughout technology-intensive (TI) industries, with widespread steady increase in TI industry and business performance instability as key implications. We set this conclusion within a broader framework of purportedly increasing dynamic competition among TI industry businesses, and then test for evidence of its performance implications in a large sample of U.S. businesses operating from 1978 to 1997 in 31 industries, with high average research and development expenditure-to-sales ratios. In the full sample, we find no evidence of sustained increase in TI industry and business performance instability, nor any evidence of significant cross-sectional differences in performance instability between TI and non-TI industry businesses over these 20 years. For a small segment of very high-performing businesses from TI industries, however, we do uncover evidence of declining performance stability and cross-sectional differences in performance stability. We conclude that assumptions of widespread long-term increase in dynamic competition lack robust evidentiary support. It is premature to embrace and apply broadly new theoretical perspectives, management practices, and public policies to TI industry competitive dynamics that may be slightly changed since the late 1970s. Yet, there may be increasing dynamic competition among very high-performing TI industry businesses. In that small realm, careful application of new perspectives, practices, and policies may lead to deeper insight on business behavior and performance in TI industries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0392","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics in technology-intensive industries without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Building on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view, I argue that, because JVs often involve incomplete contracts, differences in wealth gains arise due to resource appropriation and private benefits. As a result, two factors become important in understanding whether a firm earns higher/lower wealth gains than its partner: (1) its potential for earning private benefits and (2) its ability to extract private benefits. As a test of the impact of the first factor, I propose that when a JV is formed, the partner that possesses more valuable resources is likely to earn lower wealth gains whereas the partner that possesses less valuable resources is likely to earn higher wealth gains because its potential for earning private benefits over the course of the venture is also higher. I then argue that the partner with less valuable resources is likely to extract higher private benefits and gain more when it has greater bargaining power and absorptive capacity. Conversely, the partner with more valuable resources is likely to protect itself better from appropriation when it has JV capabilities. I find support for these arguments in a sample of 344 ventures. The implications are that private benefits significantly influence value creation in JVs, and that a broad array of contingencies and factors affect these benefits which need to be considered when entering into a cooperation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0393","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['resource appropriation', 'private benefits', 'wealth gains']","The article primarily focuses on economic factors related to joint ventures and resource allocation, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that a better understanding of postmerger organizational dynamics calls for conceptualization of discursive legitimation as an inherent part of unfolding merger processes. In particular, we focus on the recursive relationship between legitimation and organizational action. We have two objectives: to outline a theoretical model that helps one to understand the dynamics of discursive legitimation and organizational action in postmerger organizations, and to examine a revealing case to distinguish the inherent risks and problems in discursive legitimation. Our case analysis focuses on the merger between the French pharmaceutical companies BioM\u00e9rieux and Pierre Fabre. We adopt a critical multimethod approach and distinguish specific discursive dynamics and pathological tendencies in this case. The analysis highlights the unintended consequences of discursive legitimation, the central role of sensegiving and sensehiding in discursive legitimation, the inherently political nature of legitimation and the risks associated with politicization, the special problems associated with fashionable discourses and the role of the media, the use of specific discursive strategies for legitimation and delegitimation, and the crucial role of actual integration results. This analysis adds to the existing research on mergers and acquisitions by treating discursive legitimation as part of the merger dynamics. In particular, our case analysis provides a new explanation for merger failure. We also believe that the recursive model connecting discursive legitimation and delegitimation strategies to concrete organizational action makes a more general contribution to our understanding of organizational legitimation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0394","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['discursive legitimation', 'political nature', 'sensegiving', 'organizational action']","The article discusses the inherently political nature of legitimation and the risks associated with politicization, indicating a moderate engagement with social themes.

While it is widely acknowledged that managers face pressures from financial markets to choose strategies that maximize shareholder value, little work in the technological change literature has considered the possible influences of public equity markets and the securities analysts who mediate them on incumbent firms challenged with technological change. In this paper, I begin to address the topic by empirically exploring how securities analysts react to the different strategies undertaken by incumbent firms faced with radical technological change. I study the question in two settings: the shift to digital technology in photography and the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology in wireline telecommunications. I find evidence that analysts are more attentive and positive toward incumbents' strategies that extend and preserve the existing technology than toward strategies that respond directly to the new technology. In these settings, analysts largely ignore incumbents' strategies that directly incorporate the new technology for several years following the discontinuity. This study provides insights into the nature and direction of analysts' reactions to firms' strategies in the context of technological change, and is a first step toward better understanding of the potential role of analysts' and financial markets in incumbent adaptation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0395","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical and financial aspects of how securities analysts respond to technological changes in established firms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we build on real options theory and develop the argument that the visibility of firms having an initial public offering (IPO) can shape investors' recognition of the embedded growth opportunities and therefore channel their alliance activities. The evidence shows that firms are more likely to partner with IPO firms possessing more valuable growth opportunities.

New-technology development projects are traditionally judged by market success\u2014and most fail. If we examine their impact on existing-technology product development, a different interpretation arises. Drawing on the literature on the influence of social factors on interfirm search and adoption of new technologies, this study argues that similar processes occur intrafirm. Evidence from a field study on new-technology product development in high-technology firms shows that internal competition influences existing-technology product development groups to integrate the new technology into the next generation of their own products. The reason is twofold. First, these groups shift their search toward the new technology and allocate resources to gain a deeper understanding of it. Second, access to internal information and the mobility of workers across project boundaries benefit the existing-technology groups. The findings provide a model of innovation that illustrates an endogenous process of internal competition. This often political and contentious process can have a strong influence on technology adoption and integration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0399","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['internal competition', 'technology adoption', 'social factors']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of technology adoption and internal competition within firms, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We conducted 89 interviews in a high-tech multinational corporation with employees at multiple levels in two manufacturing and two R&D units that differed significantly on \u201cspeak up\u201d-related items on a company-wide employee survey. Systematic analysis of the interview data led us to conclude that a broad spectrum of leaders from supervisors to senior managers influences individual employee voice perceptions in both direct and indirect ways. For example, informants referred to \u201cskip-level leaders,\u201d those leaders two to five levels above themselves, as reasons to view voice as risky or futile nearly as often as they referred to immediate bosses. We present evidence related to \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d these patterns of influence occur by reviewing the direct and indirect modes of influence identified and by outlining the managerial functions that provide occasions for skip-level leaders to have direct influences on employee voice perceptions. We also point to differences in the specific echelons of leadership that were most influential across the units studied. We propose that multilevel, multileader influences on voice perceptions result naturally from modern workflows, the essential functions performed by skip-level leaders, and deep-seated employee attitudes about authority in hierarchical organizations. We propose further that differences in which levels of skip-level leadership are most critical to employee voice perceptions in different units depend on which leaders have the power to handle strategic contingencies and to resolve key uncertainties within particular work environments. Finally, we delve into the theoretical implications of our findings to offer a set of research propositions that can be tested in future research. Collectively, our findings point to a complex and nuanced picture of multilevel leader influences on employee voice perceptions with important practical implications for management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0405","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['employee voice', 'leadership', 'influence', 'authority', 'perceptions']","The article discusses the influence of leadership on employee voice perceptions, which touches on themes of organizational ethics and employee empowerment.

It proposes and tests a model that consists of two sets of external learning activities: those that allow a team to learn from external experienced others about its task (vicarious learning activities) and those that allow a team to learn from external sources about its context (contextual learning activities). Qualitative data from six teams in one pharmaceutical firm are used to develop measures. Survey data from 62 additional teams in six other pharmaceutical firms are used, first to test the measurement model using structural equation modeling and second to test the relationships between external learning activities and team performance using random-effects regression models. Results show that vicarious learning activities are more strongly associated with performance when teams engage in more internal learning activities. Furthermore, vicarious learning activities in the absence of sufficient amounts of internal learning activities can hurt performance. The positive performance associated with contextual learning activities, by contrast, is unaffected by the level of internal learning activities. The paper contributes by distinguishing between two kinds of external learning activities and showing that they put different demands on teams to be effective. This is important because it helps us better understand how teams engage effectively in learning activities across their boundaries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0413","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['learning', 'performance', 'teams']","The article focuses on team performance and learning activities without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In this study, we explore the impact of GDT configuration (i.e., the relative number of team members at different sites, independent of the characteristics of those members or the spatial and temporal distances among them) on individual, subgroup, and team-level dynamics. In a quasi-experimental setting, we examine the effects of configuration using a sample of 62 six-person teams in four different one- and two-site configurations. As predicted based on social categorization, we find that configuration significantly affects team dynamics\u2014independent of spatio-temporal distance and socio-demographic factors. More specifically, we find that the social categorization in teams with geographically based subgroups (defined as two or more members per site) triggers significantly weaker identification with the team, less effective transactive memory, more conflict, and more coordination problems. Furthermore, imbalance in the size of subgroups (i.e., the uneven distribution of members across sites) invokes a competitive, coalitional mentality that exacerbates these effects; subgroups with a numerical minority of team members report significantly poorer scores on identification, transactive memory, conflict, and coordination problems. In contrast, teams with geographically isolated members (i.e., members who have no teammates at their site) have better scores on these same four outcomes than both balanced and imbalanced configurations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0434","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['subgroups', 'imbalance', 'team dynamics', 'social categorization']","The article discusses the effects of geographic configuration on team dynamics, highlighting issues of social categorization and subgroup imbalance, which relate to themes of diversity and inclusion within organizational contexts.

As a consequence, environmental conditions at founding cannot explain organizational founding. Future levels of resource availability may be estimated, but not directly observed by potential entrepreneurs at the time at which they decide to enter preproduction. In this paper, we take these considerations as our starting point to build a dynamic feedback model of organization founding. According to the model, organizational founding is driven by expectations that entrepreneurs form about future levels of resources and, only indirectly, by current levels of population density. We explore the behavior of the model under a variety of experimental conditions. We show that the qualitative behavior of the model is consistent with studies that have linked the duration of preproduction stage with fluctuations in density during population maturity. Our simulation analyses sustains three main conclusions. First, historical trajectories of organizational populations that are consistent with empirical observations may be produced by mechanisms that are not directly dependent on density. Second, alternative hypotheses about how expectations are formed produce qualitatively different historical trajectories of density. Third, fluctuations in numbers of organizations are linked to specific aspects of individual organization-building decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0437","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of organizational founding and resource availability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specialists usually gain access to new clients through referrals from generalists. To ensure a continuing stream of engagements, specialists often form referral alliances with multiple generalists. Engaging the right generalist partners and allocating resources to the resulting referral relationships are among the most important challenges facing these specialist firms. In this study, we examine how competition affects the management of referral alliances over time. Because of the high level of inseparability of the professional service engagement, the nature of competition among specialists is complex. Building on the ecological view of competition, we model the degree of niche overlap in the specialist's home markets and the generalists' markets as well as the potential overlap due to the proximity of rivals vis-\u00e0-vis generalists. Using data on visiting consultant clinics involving cardiology specialty practices and rural hospitals from a Midwestern state over a 13-year period, we find that the various aspects of niche overlap influence the involvement of these specialist professional service firms in referral alliances as well as resources they allocate to these relationships. In addition to expanding our understanding of vertical, bilateral alliances between professional service firms, this study enhances our general understanding of strategic alliances by demonstrating how partner attractiveness and the actions of rivals affect the resource allocation decisions of firms managing multiple strategic alliances over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0448","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competition and resource allocation in professional service firms without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The first type deals with the degree to which the capabilities of an actor can be inferred over time based on known performance dimensions. We label this technical uncertainty. The second type deals with assessing whether the perceived capabilities of the actor meet the standard of desirability, which we call performance standard uncertainty. We propose and test that certifications will positively influence the long-term reputation of actors in situations that involve minimal technical uncertainty, and that, across levels of technical performance, certifications will have an inverted U-shaped relationship with assessments of actors such that certifications will have the greatest impact on assessments of actors who are close to the uncertain standard of desirability. We test our hypotheses in the context of the voting for Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame, an environment where comprehensive technical performance measures leave little technical uncertainty. Our results support our hypotheses and suggest that certifications can influence an actor's reputation by reducing performance standard uncertainty rather than just technical uncertainty, as previously presumed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0400","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['certifications', 'reputation', 'uncertainty']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of certifications and their impact on reputation, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the \u201crewards\u201d of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the variability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models. From an empirical point of view, results are confirmed using both patent-based and skill mobility-based measures of knowledge spillovers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0449","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['organizational characteristics', 'knowledge clusters', 'rewards']","The article discusses organizational characteristics and their impact on regional economic outcomes, but it does not explicitly address social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Achieving transaction alignment requires firms to balance multiple goals. Drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm, I note that firms often assign different goals to different organizational units. As a consequence, simple problems about whether to make or buy can be affected by multiple decisions taken by multiple, locally rational units. I use a case study of the management of IT consultants in a financial services firm to explore how make-or-buy decisions are made. I find that senior managers at the firm focused on cost and organizational flexibility, whereas frontline managers concentrated on exploiting workers' existing knowledge. The narrow focus of these two groups interacted with the complex demands of transaction alignment to create three problems: separation of related decisions about internal capacity and project staffing, incomplete information when deciding on organizational capacity, and incentive misalignment in staffing consultants. These problems led the firm to become dependent on its consultants. I build on the case study to develop theoretical propositions about the characteristics of decisions and organizational structure that are most likely to lead boundary decisions to deviate from existing predictions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0457","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['decision making', 'organizational units', 'transaction alignment']","The article discusses decision-making structures and organizational goals, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Teams comprised of individuals with diverse skills and expertise may be well suited to perform such work. However, as teams become more prevalent, organizations may struggle with ways to exercise control. Formal controls, with their focus on prespecified rules, performance targets, and hierarchical relationships, may be less effective in a teamwork environment than clan control, in which work-related behavior is motivated by shared norms and values, as well as a common vision, and individuals attempt to be accepted or \u201cregular\u201d members of a team. However, little is known about the antecedents of clan control. Much of the existing empirical research on the antecedents of control has been influenced by Ouchi's (Ouchi, W. G. 1977. The relationship between organizational structure and organizational control. Admin. Sci. Quart.22 95\u2013113) framework, which posits clan control is used when managers lack knowledge of means\u2013ends relationships and are unable to measure outcomes. This paper adopts the view that clan control is a \u201cpeople\u201d or social process and argues that social capital, a construct that reflects connections and relationships among individuals, is a missing, key antecedent of clan control. In particular, we posit that the existence of social capital enables team members, as well as project managers, to facilitate clan control within a team, i.e., team-based clan control. A model is developed and hypotheses are tested using survey data collected from 95 information systems project teams. The results suggest that social capital assets are associated with team-based clan control. Recognizing that the project manager typically has a different level of organizational authority than team members, additional hypotheses are developed relating characteristics of the project manager to team-based clan control. The results of these tests suggest that team-based clan control is also dependent on the manager's knowledge of business processes and the application area, coupled with the extent to which he observes the behaviors of the project team. Thus, our results suggest that there are conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by the project team as a whole (including team members and project managers), as well as conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by project managers in their role as team leaders. Implications and suggestions for future work are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0458","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['social capital', 'team-based', 'diverse skills', 'shared norms', 'values']","The article discusses the importance of social capital and shared norms in team dynamics, which aligns with moderate woke themes of collaboration and diversity.

In this study, we focus on one form of VCE, online customer forums, and propose that the relevance of four distinct theoretical perspectives\u2014social capital theory, social exchange theory, involvement, and social identity theory\u2014to explaining customer participation will be contingent on the nature of the customer contribution context, that is, whether the contributions are to the customer community (through product support) or to the company (through product ideation). We propose a model suggesting that customers' prosocial behavior and expectations of private rewards will shape contributions to the community, whereas their perceived innovation partnership with the company and expectations of private rewards will shape a contribution to the company. We also contend that these effects will be moderated by customers' identification with the community and with the company. Our empirical findings offer support for the model and indicate that online customer forums (and more broadly VCEs) should be tailored to fit the nature of customer contribution sought.

But how do business leaders do that concretely? Organization research shows that managers are more inclined to identify threats than opportunities, but it is still not clear why this is the case. Likewise, research points to several factors that may facilitate the recognition of opportunities. Yet empirical observations have been limited by retrospective biases and other conceptual challenges. As a result, key questions remain not only about what factors facilitate the recognition of opportunities, but also about why these factors play such a role. To further understanding of these issues, we study the reasoning strategies that individuals mobilize for recognizing opportunities. We develop a model of opportunity recognition as a cognitive process of structural alignment, and analyze the think-aloud verbalizations of executive entrepreneurs as they try to recognize opportunities for new technologies. In contrast to prior research, the qualitative and quantitative data do not provide evidence that individuals use prototypes to recognize opportunities. Instead, we find that different kinds of mental connections play different roles in the process of recognizing opportunities, with different consequences. We also document why and how prior knowledge may facilitate this process. By drawing attention to the cognitive underpinnings of opportunity recognition, we cast light on why it constitutes such a challenging task for individuals and organizations. In turn, this provides a useful basis for exploring the factors that explain why some individuals/organizations are able to recognize opportunities that others simply fail to see.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0462","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['opportunity', 'recognition', 'cognitive processes']","The article focuses primarily on cognitive processes related to opportunity recognition within organizations, lacking explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our approach offers opportunities to do precisely this. Moreover, we suggest summary statistics that can be applied to test for the (non)significance of fit linkages at both the disaggregated level of individual bivariate interactions, as well as the aggregated level of groups of multivariate interactions. We systematically compare our approach with extant alternatives using simulations, including the fit-as-mediation alternative. We find that our approach outperforms these established alternatives by including fit-as-moderation and fit-as-deviation as special cases, by being better able to capture the nature of the underlying fit structure in the data and by being relatively robust to mismeasurements, small sample sizes, and collinearity.

We model structural regularities at the dyadic and the extradyadic level by applying a class of multivariate exponential random graph models. Our findings contribute to the existing literature in three ways: (1) Although networks are particularly likely to exhibit some types of structural regularities (e.g., reciprocity and transitivity), there are other relational forms such as cycles that seem to be of limited relevance. (2) Structural regularities are not limited to a single type of relation but may comprise instrumental and affective relational ties simultaneously. (3) An organization's formal cooperation structure has surprisingly limited influence on the structural patterns of cooperation, whereas friendship ties are embedded in managers' regular interaction patterns in many different ways.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0450","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['collaborative networks', 'cooperative relationships', 'structural regularities']","The article primarily focuses on the structural aspects of intraorganizational networks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Despite this attention, however, the question of how firms can better maintain the balance of exploration and exploitation remains unresolved. Drawing on a wide range of research on population and organization structure, we argue that an organization divided into semi-isolated subgroups may help strike this balance. We simulate such an organization, systematically varying the interaction pattern between individuals to explore how the degree of subgroup isolation and intergroup connectivity influences organizational learning. We also test this model with a range of contingency variables highlighted in the management research. We find that moderate levels of cross-group linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across groups without reducing organizational diversity too quickly.

To test the model, an experimental methodology was used in which a member transfers from one group to another, transmitting knowledge in the form of a production routine. As predicted, work groups unlocked the knowledge transfer potential arising from personnel movement more often when they shared a superordinate identity than when they did not share such an identity, and this identity effect was moderated by knowledge demonstrability. When knowledge was less demonstrable with concealed merits, it was more likely to transfer between groups that shared a superordinate identity, compared to groups that did not share such an identity. By contrast, when knowledge was more demonstrable with apparent merits, it was as likely to transfer between groups that shared a superordinate identity compared to groups that did not share such an identity. As predicted, superordinate identity induced knowledge consideration, the focusing of group attention on determining the value of another's knowledge. Mediated moderation analyses revealed that this process underlies knowledge transfer. Superordinate social identity induced thorough knowledge consideration, which was more important for recognizing the value of knowledge when its merits were concealed rather than apparent. Because the merits of many organizational routines and practices are concealed and superordinate identity appears to be a key to unlocking the knowledge transfer potential of less demonstrable knowledge, this study has important implications for managing knowledge resources.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0469","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['superordinate social identity', 'knowledge transfer', 'organizational routines']","The article discusses the concept of 'superordinate social identity,' which relates to group dynamics and identity in organizational contexts, indicating a moderate focus on social aspects within management.

In contrast, we find that the loss of personnel does not affect a firm's social capital or influence over standards directly but that it does have an effect on firm social capital and influence contingent on changes in the firm's business strategy.

We define a technology gap as the space in a workflow between two technologies wherein the output of the first technology is meant to be the input to the second one. Using data from an inductive study of two engineering occupations (hardware engineering and structural engineering), we analyzed engineers' gap encounters (episodes in which a technology gap appeared in the course of action) and found striking differences in how engineers minded the gaps. Hardware engineers minded the gaps by coordinating technologies via \u201cbridges\u201d that automated data transfers between technologies. Structural engineers, in contrast, allowed technology gaps to persist even though traversing gaps consumed significant time and effort. Our findings highlight a difference between task and technology in the degree of coordination necessary for success.

In this paper, we use a simulation model to explore how context and firm similarity, interdependence among practices, context and firm similarity, and time horizon interact in nontrivial ways to determine the payoffs that arise from different breadths of imitation. The results of the model allow us to qualify and refine predictions of the extant literature on imitation. In particular, the results shed light on the conditions under which increases in imitation breadth, and hence investments that facilitate the faithful copying of more practices, are valuable. In addition, the results of the model highlight that imitation can serve two different functions\u2014mimicking high performers, and generating search by dislodging a firm from its current set of practices\u2014each requiring different organizational routines for its successful implementation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0477","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on knowledge transfer and organizational learning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We begin by noting the uncertain conceptual status of the structure concept in the small groups literature and propose a conceptualization of team structure that is grounded in the long tradition of work on formal structure in the sociology and organization theory literatures. We then consider the thesis that, at least in self-managed teams dealing with stable tasks, greater team structure\u2014i.e., higher levels of specialization, formalization, and hierarchy\u2014can promote learning by encouraging information sharing, reducing conflict frequency, and fostering a climate of psychological safety; that is, we examine a mediated model in which the effect of structure on learning and improvement in teams is mediated by psychological safety, information sharing, and conflict frequency. This model was largely supported in a study of self-managed production teams in a Fortune 100 high-technology firm, although the observed pattern of mediation was more complex than anticipated. Higher structure was also associated with actual productivity improvements in a subsample of these teams. The theory and results of this study advance our understanding of team learning and underscore the importance of team structure in research on team processes and performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0483","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['psychological safety', 'team structure', 'information sharing']","The article discusses psychological safety and team structure, which are relevant to organizational behavior and can indirectly relate to DEI themes.

We distinguish between open and closed strategies and posit that these are opposing but complementary in that each fosters one of two processes necessary for team innovation: open action strategies (e.g., delegative leadership) promote knowledge generation, and closed action strategies (e.g., directive leadership) enhance knowledge integration. We argue that each pole of a pair of opposing action strategies both energizes and detracts from elements of innovation. Thus, it could be expected that combining opposing action strategies leads to an impasse, as the negative effects of each strategy might offset the positive effects of the opposite strategy. There is currently no viable explanation in the literature for why this mutual neutralization may not occur. We aim to fill this gap by explicating why and how opposing action strategies, when implemented simultaneously, do not countervail each other's positive effects, but rather yield positive synergies that fuel team innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0485","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['innovation', 'strategies', 'leadership']","The article discusses team innovation and leadership strategies, but it does not explicitly address themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

Micro-process research in organizational studies rests on implicit phenomenological assumptions that vary in the extent to which micro-processes are viewed as parts of larger systems. We suggest that phenomenological assumptions linking micro-processes to organizational contexts highlight the relevance of micro-process research findings to broader organizational questions and therefore increase the likelihood that the findings will disseminate to the larger field of organizational research. We test this assertion by analyzing studies of negotiation published in top peer-reviewed management, psychology, sociology, and industrial relations journals from 1990 to 2005. Our findings reveal a continuum of open systems to closed systems phenomenological assumptions in negotiation research. Analysis of the citation rates of the articles in our data set by non-negotiation organizational research indicates that more open systems assumptions increase the likelihood that a negotiation article will be cited in organizational studies, after controlling for other, previously identified effects on citation rates.

Evidence from International Courier Services","A firm often must ensure that products or services it produces match customer expectations. We define variability as any deviation in a production process yielding products or services whose attributes differ from the firm's stated target specifications. Firms pursuing products marked by low variability are more subject to maladaptation costs if production processes are not adjusted to avoid nonconformities. Furthermore, such adjustments often require idiosyncratic investments (e.g., dedicated information technology systems), thereby creating contractual hazards and potential underinvestment. We hypothesize that ownership of sequential activities in the value chain helps mitigate problems associated with maladaptation as well as suboptimalities in transaction-specific investment, thereby resulting in lower variability. Using data on delivery times from the Japanese international courier and small package services industry, we assess the variability-reducing role of ownership in two complementary ways. The first approach is parametric, allowing us to assess the impact of ownership on the variance associated with delivery time; here we focus on shipments that frequently fail to arrive precisely within the time period initially expected by customers. The second approach is more consistent with the notion of reliability, or the likelihood that shipments will not arrive later than expected: we nonparametrically estimate the distribution of deviations between actual and expected delivery time, and verify how distinct organizational choices change the distribution. Ownership of multiple segments yields a particularly pronounced effect on both variance and reliability. Ownership bestows variability-reducing benefits of ownership, especially when ownership is observed in multiple stages of the value chain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0482","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production variability and ownership without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

GPIs are substantial technical advances in the performance of products within technology regimes. Prior studies of innovation timing in the organizational strategy literature emphasize internally driven strategies of GPI. Although internally driven strategies may predominate when businesses face diffuse competition for their product lines, the literature largely overlooks the point that businesses need to be increasingly responsive to external events as market concentration increases. This study, which examines businesses competing in the U.S. packaged software industry in the 1990s, shows that increasing industry concentration raises the stakes surrounding market positions and leads to greater interdependence of innovation strategies in an industry\u2014including interactions both with competitors and with other players in a larger system of complementary products.

Controlling for past performance significantly weakens the positive relationship between brokering position and innovative performance. Furthermore, when inventor-level heterogeneity is controlled for through inventor fixed effects, the position-performance correlation disappears.

Our case analysis illustrates how a bottom-up process of environmental sensemaking led to the emergence and adoption of a logic of managed care, which provided new organizing principles in the hospitals' organizational field. In addition to theorization, highlighted by prior research, we propose a second mechanism of environmental sensemaking: representation of change through exemplars and environmental features. The interplay between theorization, representation, and ongoing event attention can lead to change in institutional logics over an event's life course. We found that the managed care logic did not emerge in a fully formed fashion, but that actors theorized individual dimensions of the logic consistent with changing representations of hospitals' relationships with other actors in the field. As the event unfolded, the individual dimensions came to be theorized as part of an overall managed care logic. The label \u201cmanaged care,\u201d previously understood as a specific organizational form, took on a new meaning to symbolize the organizing principles for hospitals' relationships with a variety of institutional actors as alternative models not congruent with the changing organizational field were abandoned.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0490","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['environmental sensemaking', 'institutional logics', 'managed care', 'representation', 'cognitive realignment']","The article discusses themes of environmental sensemaking and institutional logics, which touch upon the broader implications of health care reform and representation in organizational contexts.

Twenty years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field is characterized by a wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how \u201cmicro-antecedents\u201d and \u201cmacro-antecedents\u201d influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance.

By theorizing a new concept\u2014the trap of continual change\u2014in the IEJV context, we challenge the adaptive viewpoint assumed in alliance dynamics research. We propose that partners sometimes respond to an initial dissatisfaction with the venture result with a dysfunctional repetition of rearranging the ownership control structure. This continual change locks the organization into bad choices and sends it into a downward spiral. Acknowledging the mixed motive nature of inter-partner relationships, we incorporate cooperative versus competitive dynamics manifested in shared control arrangements. We propose that shared ownership control lends stability to the IEJV until the initial IEJV agreement is renegotiated; this stability is a result of the cooperative forces of mutual interdependence and mutual forbearance between the partners. However, when the power balance breaks down, the potential for inter-partner conflict increases. When the ownership control structure of the IEJV is restructured, especially multiple times, shared control arrangements become increasingly unstable as behavioral, cultural, and managerial differences are amplified.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0489","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['ownership', 'control', 'cooperative', 'conflict']","The article focuses primarily on ownership changes and performance in international equity joint ventures, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This emphasis on similarity to existing institutions stresses conformity and promotes legitimacy. Yet analogies can also have a cognitive effect on institutional design, especially once initial acceptance from the environment has been secured, by directing attention toward incongruences between the emergent institution and its analogical source. Institutional entrepreneurship can spur innovation and departure from existing institutions by highlighting limitations of the analogical source and providing a compelling value-rational argument that underscores the worth of the new institution.

Prior research has focused on \u201cnot-invented-here (NIH)\u201d tendencies, which refer to negative attitudes in organizations toward the acquisition of knowledge from external sources. In this research, we develop the concept of \u201cnot-sold-here (NSH)\u201d tendencies, which result from protective attitudes in firms toward the external exploitation of knowledge, for example, technology licensing. We show conceptually how NSH tendencies develop and how they can influence the extent of outward knowledge transfer. We test five hypotheses regarding antecedents and consequences of NSH tendencies with data from 152 firms spanning multiple industries. The empirical findings show that NSH tendencies exist in organizations and that they constitute a major barrier to the implementation of external knowledge commercialization strategies. The concept of NSH therefore helps explain the varying degrees of activity in external knowledge exploitation, and it contributes to understanding particular microfoundations of dynamic capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0499","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge', 'attitudes', 'external']","The article primarily focuses on organizational behavior and knowledge transfer without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Existing theory says that truces balance cognitive and motivational differences across functions, but there is scant evidence on how truces work. We show both stability and change in routines. For minor price adjustments, routines incorporate truces in stable but separate market interpretations by the sales and marketing groups. Major price changes put truces at risk, as latent conflict over information and interests becomes overt. The ensuing battle shows how interests, information, and truces are intertwined in performing the routine. Routines are not just stable entities, but adaptive performances that include conflict. We illustrate how our approach addresses fundamental problems such as how firms perform economics, how routines incorporate economic theory, and how routines shape macroeconomic dynamics.

The Unintended Signaling Effects of Educational Prestige on External Expectations of Team Performance","In this paper we report the results of two experimental studies designed to test how demographic characteristics affect outsiders' assessments of a firm's top managers. We draw on theories of evaluation and status characteristics to examine the interactive effects of managers' racial characteristics and educational prestige on external perceptions. In the first study, we find that top executives' educational background and race affected analysts' valuation of a firm's stock. Outside analysts made the highest stock price projections for firms led by white executives who had highly prestigious educational backgrounds but made the lowest valuations for firms led by African Americans with the same prestigious education. We posit that the moderating effect of executives' racial characteristics stems from outsiders' assumptions that African American managers received preferential treatment in the admissions process for high prestige universities. In the second study, we find that when we explicitly removed the possibility of preferential selection, analysts gave the same stock valuation to firms led by white and African American executives with high educational prestige.

In particular, we investigate the impact of prior alliance experience on the performance implications of corporate acquisitions. We start with the simple suggestion that such experience spillovers will depend on the similarity among the managerial processes characterizing these activities. The empirical evidence confirms that the more the focal acquisition is managed in ways that are typical of partnerships (e.g., with low integration or with high relational quality levels), the more positive is the effect of past alliance experience on acquisition performance. However, we also find that alliance experience can be detrimental under certain circumstances, such as when the acquisition is managed with more aggressive post-acquisition integration approaches.

We propose that envy and empathy lead employees to discriminate in illicitly helping customers based on customer wealth. We test for this hypothesis in the vehicle emissions testing market, where employees have the opportunity to illegally help customers by passing vehicles that would otherwise fail emissions tests. We find that for a significant number of inspectors, leniency is much higher for those customers with standard vehicles than for those with luxury cars, although a smaller group appears to favor wealthy drivers. We also investigate the psychological mechanisms explaining this wealth-based discriminatory behavior using a laboratory study. Our experiment shows that individuals are more willing to illegally help peers when those peers drive standard rather than luxury cars, and that envy and empathy mediate this effect. Collectively, our results suggest the presence of wealth-based discrimination in employee\u2013customer relations and that envy toward wealthy customers and empathy toward those of similar economic status drive much of this illegal behavior.

However, the results also show that capabilities in the traditional technology and the emerging technology have different effects. Firms with capabilities in the emerging technology are more likely to enter new technological fields and more likely to use internal development in doing so. Complementary capabilities also increase the rate of entry into emerging technological fields. However, capabilities in traditional technology are found to be unrelated to the propensity to enter new fields, and to the choice of entry mode.

An analysis of 287 transactions between buyers and suppliers of information technology supports that partner search and experience facilitate learning and subsequent control design, but that partner experience simultaneously reduces the need for control and the intensity of the partner search process.

We raise two questions. First, what is the relative effect of the gender composition and comparison level of career referents on such expectations? Second, what happens to career expectations when women and men identify career referents at the same comparison level? Current research suggests that women have lower career expectations than men because they compare themselves with women who hold lower-level positions than the career referents identified by men. Thus, if women and men identify with career referents at a similar level, their career expectations should be equal. However, this chain of reasoning has not been tested. Using data collected from a large organization, we identify both the specific individuals that women and men perceive as having similar careers and these referents' career levels, defined as their hierarchical level in the firm. The results show that the level of career referents is more important than their gender composition in explaining individuals' career expectations. In contrast to extant explanations, the results show that even when women identify career referents at the same levels as men do, they still exhibit significantly lower career expectations. Drawing on social comparison theory, we speculate that this occurs because men's expectations are bolstered by extreme upward comparisons, whereas women's expectations are dampened, perhaps because they see high-achieving others as representing a less probable goal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0508","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['gender', 'career expectations', 'social comparison']","The article addresses gender disparities in career expectations, highlighting the impact of gender composition and comparison levels, which aligns with themes of diversity and equity.

Dilemmas of New Organizational Forms","An important new stream of thought stressing the importance of organizational fluidity has emerged in recent years. It represents a reaction to the increasing complexity and environmental turbulence that organizations have to master. The solutions proposed are highly flexible and fluid organizational forms, based on relentlessly changing templates, quick improvisation, and ad hoc responses. This approach is in sharp contrast to other recent organizational research that emphasizes identity, path dependence, economies of specialization, and recursive practices. We juxtapose the idea of organizational fluidity with this latter stream of research. If taken to its final conclusion, then the idea of promoting organizational fluidity would imply losing the very essence of organizing. Nevertheless, achieving organizational flexibility remains imperative in increasingly complex and volatile environments. To deal with this dilemma, an alternative approach is needed. We suggest a conceptualization of this dilemma that emphasizes the complementary dynamics between the two perspectives.

A key premise is that the microfoundational link from organization, strategy, and dynamic capabilities to performance centers on how leaders manage the fundamental tension between efficiency and flexibility. We develop several insights. First, regarding structure, we highlight that organizations often drift toward efficiency, and so balancing efficiency and flexibility comes, counterintuitively, through unbalancing to favor flexibility. Second, we argue that environmental dynamism, rather than being simply stable or dynamic, is a multidimensional construct with dimensions that uniquely influence the importance and ease of balancing efficiency and flexibility. Third, we outline how executives balance efficiency and flexibility through cognitively sophisticated, single solutions rather than by simply holding contradictions. Overall, we go beyond the caricature of new organizational forms as obsessed with fluidity and the simplistic view of routines as the microfoundation of performance. Rather, we contribute a more accurate view of how leaders effectively balance between efficiency and flexibility by emphasizing heuristics-based \u201cstrategies of simple rules,\u201d multiple environmental realities, and higher-order \u201cexpert\u201d cognition.

We study both centralized and decentralized cases and identify the conditions to coordinate the supply chain under implementation of RFID. We show that the incentives of the parties for investing in the technology are not perfectly aligned in the existence of the fixed cost of investment. Based on the relative payments of the parties for the fixed cost of investment, the incentives to adopt RFID can be characterized into regions, where we observe only one party or two parties benefiting from the technology when the tag price falls in a region specified in the paper.

Since the number of such solicitations far exceeds the number of movies that can be feasibly screened at a multiplex (i.e., a theater with multiple screens), the problem of interest for an exhibitor is that of choosing a subset of movies for which to submit bids to the distributors. We consider the problem of the selection and screening of movies for a multiplex to maximize the exhibitor's cumulative revenue over a fixed planning horizon. The release times of the movies that can potentially be selected during the planning horizon are known a priori. If selected for screening, a movie must be scheduled through its obligatory period, after which its run may or may not be extended. The problem involves two primary decisions: (i) the selection of a subset of movies for screening from those that can potentially be screened during the planning horizon and (ii) the determination of the duration of screening for the selected movies. We investigate two basic and popular screening policies: preempt\u2010resume and non\u2010preempt. In the preempt\u2010resume policy, the screening of a movie can be preempted and resumed in its post\u2010obligatory period. In the non\u2010preempt policy, a movie is screened continuously from its release time until the time it is permanently withdrawn from the multiplex. We show that optimizing under the preempt\u2010resume policy is strongly NP\u2010hard while the problem under the non\u2010preempt policy is polynomially solvable. We develop efficient algorithms for the problem under both screening policies and show that the revenue obtained from the preempt\u2010resume policy can be significantly higher as compared with that from the non\u2010preempt policy. Our work provides managers of multiplexes with valuable insights into the selection and screening of movies and offers an easy\u2010to\u2010use computational tool to compare the revenues obtainable from adopting these popular policies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01066.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of revenue maximization in movie screening policies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A firm can manage this variation by acquiring a quantity of used items that exceeds demand, enabling it to remanufacture a subset of the acquired items in the best condition. As more excess items are acquired, the firm can increase its selectivity and lower its remanufacturing costs. In this paper, we examine the tradeoff of acquisition and scrapping costs vs. remanufacturing costs when used product condition is widely varying and uncertain. We derive acquisition quantities that minimize total expected costs for several representations of condition variability and remanufacturing cost structures. We find that, when costs are linear, the optimal acquisition quantity has a closed form and increases with the square root of the degree of condition variability. Our models are based on experience with remanufacturers of cell phones and imaging supplies, and application of our results is illustrated using example data from industry.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01067.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of remanufacturing and cost management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The context is very general: a production process that is characterized by multiple distinct operational states and a failure state. The operational states differ in terms of operational/quality costs and/or the proneness to complete failure. The times of shift from the normal operational state to an inferior one and the times to failure are random variables, not necessarily exponentially distributed. The process is monitored with a control chart with the purpose of quickly detecting shifts to an inferior operational state due to the occurrence of some unobservable assignable cause. At the same time, the information collected from the process may be used to re\u2010schedule the planned PM, if there is evidence that a failure is imminent. The two mechanisms are obviously related, especially if they are based on measurements of the same critical process characteristic. Yet, they are typically treated independently. We develop a fairly general mathematical model for the joint optimization of the control chart parameters and the maintenance times. Numerical investigation using this model shows that ignoring the close relationship between process control and maintenance results in inefficiencies that may be substantial. It also provides practical insights about the effects of some key problem characteristics on the optimal joint design of process control and maintenance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01073.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical process control and maintenance without any reference to social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our analysis indicates that rebates are profitable for manufacturers if consumers are inconsistent in the sense that their rebate valuation when they make purchase decisions is independent of their redemption probabilities when they make redemption decisions. If the manufacturer keeps the wholesale price unchanged, then the rebate increases the retailer's profit by a larger amount than the increase in the manufacturer's profit. If the manufacturer jointly optimizes the wholesale price and rebate, then the increase in the manufacturer's profit is twice the increase in the retailer's profit. The retailer responds to rebates by increasing the retail price, which increases the margin paid by consumers who do not redeem the rebate. On average, consumer surplus decreases when it is optimal for manufacturers to offer rebates. We suggest incentive schemes that make it worthwhile for retailers to limit the price increase. In these incentive schemes, the manufacturer imposes a negative relationship between the rebate value and the retail price.

For products with higher profit margin than the high threshold on profit margin, a retailer should always use DAS. For products with medium profit margin within the two thresholds, a retailer should adopt MAS if consumer's expected valuation is lower than the high threshold and use DAS otherwise. For products with lower profit margin than the low threshold, a retailer should use NAS, DAS, or MAS, respectively, if consumer's expected valuation is lower than the low threshold, higher than the high threshold, or between the two thresholds, respectively.

Motivated by the resource deployment decisions facing a professional service firm in the workplace training industry, we address the dynamic job acceptance and resource assignment problem for systems with general resource flexibility structure, i.e., with multiple resource types that can each perform different overlapping subsets of job types. We first show that, for systems containing specialized resources for individual job types and a versatile resource type that can perform all job types, the exact policy uses a threshold rule. With more general flexibility structures, since the associated stochastic dynamic program is intractable, we develop and test three optimization\u2010based approximate policies. Our extensive computational tests show that one of the methods, which we call the Bottleneck Capacity Reservation policy, is remarkably effective in generating near\u2010optimal solutions over a wide range of problem scenarios. We also consider a model variant that requires dynamic job acceptance decisions but permits deferring resource assignment decisions until the end of the horizon. For this model, we discuss an adaptation of our approximate policy, establish the effectiveness of this policy, and assess the value of postponing assignment decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01095.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational decision-making and resource optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Standard practice is to treat lead time demand as a random sum of random numbers and rely on established probability theory to calculate both reorder point and safety stock levels. A key assumption in these calculations, however, is that lead time and demand are not correlated. In this paper, we first explore situations where this assumption is untrue and then develop equations to determine the reorder point and the safety stock when lead time and demand are correlated. More specifically, we (1) derive formulas for the average and variance of the demand in a lead time, which can then be used to calculate the reorder point and the safety stock, (2) apply these formulas to two distributions for which there is a closed\u2010form solution: normal and Poisson, and (3) examine the effect of correlation on safety stock requirements under the normal distribution.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01109.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without addressing any social or ethical issues.

Finally, the bias in the order quantity was significantly influenced by the specific type of risk (overage or underage) that was identified closer to the decision, alluding to the presence of a recency effect.

A key concern is that earnings misrepresent changes in value in that cash outlays occur upfront but expenses are recognized only over time. While recognized expenses indeed add up to the initial cash outflow, the equality holds only in undiscounted (nominal), not discounted (real), terms. Accordingly, corporate earnings figures suffer from a form of money illusion. In this paper, we demonstrate that such money illusion can have an upside when it is present in vertical relationships subject to self\u2010interest. In particular, a buyer who focuses on earnings has incentives to increase purchases since it does not immediately encounter the full cost of cash outflows. These added incentives can promote more efficient trade. We also show that the increased incentives to buy can also lead to Pareto improvements by spurring the supplier to invest more in developing technology. Finally, we demonstrate that judiciously chosen inventory valuation rules can lead to efficient supply chain outcomes. Thus, efficiency can be achieved when supply chain parties freely trade and regulators specify only the accounting rules under which they operate.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01111.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting metrics and their impact on efficiency without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2010","19","4","Mingming Leng mmleng@ln.edu.hk and Rafael Becerril\u2010Arreola rafael.becerril.2013@anderson.ucla.eduView all authors and affiliations","Joint Pricing and Contingent Free\u2010Shipping Decisions in B2C Transactions","We consider an online retailer's joint pricing and contingent free\u2010shipping (CFS) decisions in both monopoly and duopoly structures, which is an important marketing\u2010operations interface problem.

Our results show that the external demand history of the other supply chain always helps the retailer make better forecasts when demand streams interact; however, the enhanced information alters the retailer's order process, which may produce larger forecasting errors for the supplier.

A traditional manufacturing strategy would be to employ two separate manufacturing facilities: a flexible plant for mass\u2010customized items and an efficient plant for standard items. We contrast this traditional focus strategy with an alternative that better utilizes capacity by combining production of mass\u2010customized and standard items in one of two alternate spackling strategies: (1) a pure\u2010spackling strategy, where the manufacturer produces everything in a (single) flexible plant, first manufacturing custom products as demanded each period, and then filling in the production schedule with make\u2010to\u2010stock output of standard products; or (2) a layered\u2010spackling strategy, which uses an efficient plant to make a portion of its standard items and a separate flexible plant where it spackles. We identify the optimal production strategy considering the tradeoff between the cost premium for flexible (versus efficient) production capacity and the opportunity costs of idle capacity. Spackling amortizes fixed costs of capacity more effectively and thus can increase profits from mass customization vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis a focus strategy, even with higher cost production for the standard goods.

Specifically, we disentangle the distinct effects of satisfaction and switching costs as drivers of retention among self\u2010service customers. Our empirical analysis examines 26,924 multi\u2010channel customers of a nationwide retail bank. We track each customer's channel usage, overall satisfaction, and retention over a 1\u2010year period. We find that, relative to face\u2010to\u2010face service, customers who use self\u2010service channels for a greater proportion of their transactions are either no more satisfied, or less satisfied with the service they receive, depending on the channel. However, we also find that these same customers are predictably less likely to defect to a competitor if they are heavily reliant on self\u2010service channels characterized by high switching costs. Through a mediation model, we demonstrate that, when self\u2010service usage promotes retention, it does so in a way that is consistent with switching costs. As a robustness check, we examine the behavior of channel enthusiasts, who concentrate transactions among specific channels.

The Fed believes that DIs should play a more active role in recirculating fit (i.e., usable) currency so that the societal cost of providing currency to the public is minimized. The Fed characterizes the overuse by the extent of cross shipping, a practice in which the same DI deposits and withdraws currency of the same denomination within five business days in the same geographic region. The Fed's proposal encourages DIs to fit sort and reuse deposited currency through two components: a custodial inventory program and a recirculation fee that would be charged on withdrawals of cross\u2010shipped currency. Given the geographical network of the various branches of a DI, the extent of its participation in the proposed programs depends on a variety of factors: the nature of demand and supply of currency, number and locations of the processing centers, and the resulting fit\u2010sorting, holding, and transportation costs. The interrelated nature of these decisions motivates the need for an integrated model that captures the flow of currency in the entire network of the DI. Based on our work with Brink's Inc., a leading secure\u2010logistics provider, we develop a mixed\u2010integer linear programming (MILP) model to provide managers of DIs with a decision\u2010making tool under the Fed's new guidelines. Broadly, we analyze the following questions: (i) Over all typical practical realizations of the demand for currency that a DI may face, and over all reasonable cost implications, is there a menu of \u201cgood\u201d operating policies? (ii) What is the monetary impact of fit\u2010sorting and custodial inventories on a DI? and (iii) To what extent will the Fed's new guidelines address its main goal, namely, a reduction in the practice of cross shipping by encouraging DIs to recirculate currency?","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01153.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['societal cost', 'recirculation', 'currency']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and the economic implications of currency supply networks, with minimal emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

In the management of call center networks, these partnerships are common and form an integral part of the customer care and marketing strategies in the financial services industry. For a financial services firm, configuring such a call center service network entails determining which partners to select and how to distribute service requests among vendors, while incorporating their capabilities, costs, and revenue\u2010generating abilities. Motivated by a problem facing a Fortune 500 financial services provider, we develop and apply a novel mixed integer programming model for the service network configuration problem. Our tactical decision support model effectively accounts for the firm's costs by capturing the impact of service requirements on vendor staffing levels and seat requirements, and permits imposing call routing preferences and auxiliary service costs. We implemented the model and applied it to data from an industry partner. Results suggest that our approach can generate considerable cost savings and substantial additional revenues, while ensuring high service quality.

These firms have collection centers across the country to collect outstanding balances from delinquent accounts. Their main strategy is to first send reminder notices and, if that does not work, to telephone delinquent customers and request payment. The latter often becomes necessary, resulting in high costs of collection. Automated dialers are used to make the calls, and when the call goes through, it is directed to one of several hundred associates manning computer workstations. In this operation, it is important to contact the account holder in order to discuss payment options. Simply getting someone on the line is not sufficient, because such calls would require follow\u2010up calls. The objective of efficient collections is to maximize dollars collected while minimizing costs, which generally translates to making a \u201cright party contact (RPC)\u201d in the minimum number of attempts. We developed and tested an algorithm that increased the RPC rates by over 10%. This increase translates to annual savings of several million dollars for an average credit card company.

Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of preferred calls, i.e., calls that will always generate a cross\u2010sell attempt. These provide guidelines in segment formation for marketing managers, and lead to a static heuristic policy. Numerical analysis establishes the value of different types of information, and different types of automation available for cross selling. Increased staffing for the same call volume is shown to have a positive and increasing return on revenue generation via cross selling, suggesting the need to staff for lower loads in call centers that aim to be revenue generators.

Transaction stock returns, ex post cash flows, and growth in product descriptions all increase for transactions with similar product market language, especially in competitive product markets. These gains are larger when targets are less similar to acquirer rivals and when targets have unique products. Our findings are consistent with firms merging and buying assets to exploit synergies to create new products that increase product differentiation.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/10/3773/1564619","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of mergers and acquisitions, analyzing product market synergies and financial outcomes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

This article investigates the use of a signing bonus as a tool for firms to signal to prospective employees: when they are uncertain regarding their fit with the firm, the signing bonus can serve as a credible signal of the firm's belief of said fit. The theory suggests that we should expect signing bonuses to be more common and larger when the economy is stronger, when employees are less certain of how well they will fit at the firm, when the quality of fit (known to the firm) is higher, and when performance pay is present. Employees receiving a signing bonus work harder, so the signing bonus also serves as an incentive device. This article also presents the first broad empirical look at the use of the signing bonus across industries and time.

A one-notch-higher DBRS rating corresponds to a 39-basis-point reduction in a firm's debt cost of capital. The impact on yields is driven by cases where the DBRS rating is better than other ratings and is larger among bonds rated near the investment-grade cutoff.

We first document significant stock returns around announcements of proxy vote recommendations. We then develop a multi-equation empirical procedure for disentangling the price impact of prediction effects (changes in contest outcome probabilities) from the price impact of certification effects (changes in outcome-contingent valuations). Both effects are present in the data: Voting advice is both predictive about contest outcomes and informative about the ability of dissidents to add value. Consequently, proxy advice plays a dual informational role.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/12/4419/1601171","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of proxy voting advice and its impact on stock returns, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2010","23","12","Ilan Guttman\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Ilan Guttman\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Graduate School of Business, Stanford University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Ohad Kadan\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Ohad Kadan\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Eugene Kandel\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Eugene Kandel\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        School of Business Administration and Department of Economics, Hebrew University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","Dividend Stickiness and Strategic PoolingGet access","We argue that dividend stickiness, the tendency of managers to keep dividends unchanged, implies that managers use a partially pooling dividend policy. We offer a model that demonstrates how such a policy can evolve endogenously in equilibrium. An informed manager who cares about the firm's intrinsic value as well as short-term stock price allocates earnings between investments and dividends. We show that there is a continuum of equilibria in which the dividend is constant for a range of realized earnings. Compared with the standard separating equilibrium, this partial pooling behavior induces higher firm value and lower underinvestment. We offer new empirical implications relating the pooling nature of dividend stickiness to the information environment of the firm, dividend prediction models, managerial incentives, and investment.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/12/4455/1600489","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dividend policy and managerial incentives without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

The theoretical literature on IPOs has long argued that institutional investors possess private information about IPOs and that underpricing is a mechanism for compensating them to reveal this private information. We study whether institutions indeed have private information about IPOs, retain their information advantage in post-IPO trading, and are able to realize significant profits from their participation in IPOs. We also study institutional IPO allocations and allocation sales to analyze whether institutions play an important role in supporting IPOs in the aftermarket and are rewarded by underwriters for playing such a role. We find that institutions sell 70.2% of their IPO allocations in the first year, fully realize the \u201cmoney left on the table,\u201d and do not dissipate these profits in post-IPO trading. Further, institutions hold allocations in IPOs with weaker post-issue demand for a longer period, and they are rewarded for this by underwriters with more IPO allocations. Finally, institutional trading has predictive power for long-run IPO performance, especially in IPOs in which they received allocations; however, this predictive power decays over time. Overall, our results suggest that institutional investors possess significant private information about IPOs, play an important supportive role in the IPO aftermarket, and receive considerable compensation for their participation in IPOs.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/12/4496/1600864","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of institutional investors and IPOs without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

It argues that attitudes toward ambiguity are heterogeneous across the population, just as attitudes toward risk are heterogeneous across the population, but that heterogeneity of attitudes toward ambiguity has different implications than heterogeneity of attitudes toward risk. In pa rticular, when some state probabilities are not known, agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio. This suggests a different cross section of portfolio choices, a wider range of state price/probability ratios, and different rankings of state price/probability ratios than would be predicted if state probabilities were known. Experiments confirm all of these suggestions. Our findings contradict the claim that investors who have cognitive biases do not affect prices because they are inframarginal: ambiguity-averse investors have an indirect effect on prices because they change the per capita amount of risk that is to be shared among the marginal investors. Our experimental data also suggest a positive correlation between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion that might explain the \u201cvalue effect\u201d in historical data.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/4/1325/1591781","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and investor behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The relative wealth fluctuation amplifies asset price volatility and contributes to the time variation in bond premia. Our model shows that a modest amount of heterogeneous expectations can help explain several puzzling phenomena, including the \u201cexcessive volatility\u201d of bond yields, the failure of the expectations hypothesis, and the ability of a tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates to predict bond returns.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/4/1433/1590288","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of bond markets and does not address any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In our partially revealing dynamic rational expectations equilibrium, portfolio separation fails, and indexing is not optimal. We show how uninformed investors should structure their portfolios, using the information contained in prices to cope with winner\u2019s curse problems. We implement empirically this price- contingent portfolio strategy. Consistent with our theory, the strategy outperforms economically and statistically the index. While momentum can arise in the model, in the data, the momentum strategy does not outperform the price-contingent strategy, as predicted by the theory.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/4/1503/1592566","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and portfolio choice without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

These agents can trade a complete menu of contingent claims, but they cannot commit to honor their promises, and their shares in a Lucas tree serve as collateral to back up their state-contingent promises. The limited-liability option gives rise to a second risk factor, in addition to aggregate consumption growth risk. This liquidity risk is created by binding solvency constraints, and it is measured by the growth rate of one moment of the wealth distribution. The economy is said to experience a negative liquidity shock when this growth rate is high and a large fraction of agents faces severely binding solvency constraints. The adjustment to the Breeden-Lucas stochastic discount factor induces substantial time variation in equity risk-premims that is consistent with the data at business cycle frequencies.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/4/1596/1589975","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on risk factors and wealth distribution without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Evidence from the MSCI Global Index ChangeGet access","Traditional portfolio balance theory derives a downward sloping currency demand function from limited international asset substitutability. Historically, this theory enjoyed little empirical support. We provide direct evidence by examining the exchange rate effect of a major redefinition of the MSCI Global Equity Index in 2001 and 2002. The index redefinition implied large changes in the representation of different countries in the MSCI Global Equity Index and therefore produced strong exogenous equity flows by index funds. Our event study reveals that countries with a relatively increasing equity representation experienced a relative currency appreciation upon announcement of the index change. Moreover, stock markets that are upweighted (downweighted) feature a higher (lower) permanent comovement of their currency with the basket of other MSCI currencies.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/4/1681/1590573","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on traditional finance theories and empirical evidence regarding currency demand without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Because real estate depreciates slowly, firms with high real estate holdings are more vulnerable to bad productivity shocks and hence are riskier and have higher expected returns. This prediction is supported empirically. I find that the returns of firms with a high share of real estate capital exceed that of low real estate firms by 3\u20136% annually, adjusted for exposures to the market return, size, value, and momentum factors. Moreover, conditional beta estimates reveal that these firms indeed have higher market betas, and the spread between the betas of high and low real estate firms is countercyclical.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/6/2268/1567435","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and investment returns without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

We build a model to estimate the expected revenue to managers as a function of their investor contracts, and we test how this estimated revenue varies across the characteristics of our sample funds. Among our sample funds, about two-thirds of expected revenue comes from fixed-revenue components that are not sensitive to performance. We find sharp differences between venture capital (VC) and buyout (BO) funds. BO managers build on their prior experience by increasing the size of their funds faster than VC managers do. This leads to significantly higher revenue per partner and per professional in later BO funds. The results suggest that the BO business is more scalable than the VC business and that past success has a differential impact on the terms of their future funds.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/6/2303/1569783","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the technical aspects of private equity economics without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity and inclusion.

Thus, many conventional market proxies could be perfectly consistent with the CAPM and useful for estimating expected returns.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/6/2464/2964877","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the efficiency of market proxies and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2010","23","6","Darwin Choi\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Darwin Choi\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Mila Getmansky\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Mila Getmansky\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Brian Henderson\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Brian Henderson\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        George Washington University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Heather Tookes\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Heather Tookes\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Yale School of Management\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","Convertible Bond Arbitrageurs as Suppliers of CapitalGet access","This article examines the potential impact of capital supply on security issuance.

We find that issuance is positively and significantly related to increases in all three supply measures. To provide further interpretation, we use the September/October 2008 short-selling ban as a natural experiment to examine the impact of an exogenous shock to the supply of capital from arbitrageurs.

Bankruptcy rules are therefore a necessary part of the overall financing contract, to make claims consistent and to prevent a value-reducing run for the assets of the firm.

Exercising a first-mover advantage, the incumbent increases his share of surplus by issuing public debt that appreciates in the event of merger. Incumbent debt reduces the equilibrium value of entrant assets and thus reduces the return to (likelihood of) entry through two channels: venture capitalists recover less in default and ownership rights provide weaker managerial incentives. High incumbent leverage has a countervailing cost, since the resulting debt overhang prevents ex post efficient mergers if merger surplus is low. Event risk covenants limiting counterparty debt are optimal for the incumbent, further limiting the entrant's share of merger surplus. A poison-put covenant is also optimal for the incumbent, allowing him to extract the same surplus with lower debt face value.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/7/2865/1587944","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial contracts and mergers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The cap rate\u2014that is, the rent-price ratio in commercial real estate\u2014captures fluctuations in expected returns for apartments and retail properties, as well as industrial properties. For offices, by contrast, cap rates do not forecast (in-sample) returns even though expected returns on offices are also time-varying. As implied by the present value relation, cap rates marginally forecast office rent growth but not rent growth of apartments, retail properties, and industrial properties. We link these differences in in-sample predictability to differences in the stochastic properties of the underlying commercial real estate data-generating processes. Also, rent growth predictability is observed mostly in locations characterized by higher population density and stringent land-use restrictions. The opposite is true for return predictability. The dynamic portfolio implications of time-varying commercial real estate returns are also explored in the context of a portfolio manager investing in the aggregate stock market and Treasury bills, as well as commercial real estate.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/9/3469/1673086","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of commercial real estate returns and rent growth without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Empirically, I measure public information using firms' stock returns on news days in the Dow Jones archive. I find four patterns in postnews returns and trading volume that are consistent with the asymmetric information model's predictions. Some evidence is, moreover, inconsistent with alternative theories in which traders interpret news differently for rational or behavioral reasons.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/9/3520/1671631","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial news and asymmetric information without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We find that mortgages that are originated by institutions with large negative stock returns in the quarters prior to the origination date tend to have higher credit spreads and default more than other mortgages with similar observable characteristics. Properties financed with these mortgages also exhibit weaker post-securitization operating performance. In addition, stock price loser institutions are anxious to securitize mortgages they originate more quickly. Finally we find that credit rating agencies require higher levels of subordination for CMBS pools (i.e., view these pools as riskier) that include more mortgages originated by underperforming originators. This evidence is consistent with reputation models in which poorly performing originators have less incentive to carefully evaluate the credit quality of prospective borrowers, thereby letting relatively riskier mortgages pass through their weaker screening standards.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/23/9/3558/1672043","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of commercial mortgages and their performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, a large market overlap with the arch incumbent combined with an aggressive inaugural market entry or a different market positioning reduces the probability of retaliation by the arch incumbent (and subsequently other incumbents as well), and hence increases the probability of survival for a de novo entrant.

We hypothesize that investors conjecture about the future based on information about a firm's capabilities. Each successive deal carries intrinsic value, creates experience, generates feedback, and yields information about the firm's underlying capabilities. We evaluate whether stock prices impute expectations that firms will capably pursue particular programs of acquisitions and alliances. The analysis covers how investor responses change across successive deals on the theory that firms with a concentrated program of deals may develop capabilities more intensively than those with programs that involve both acquisitions and alliances. The dataset covers the population of firms that went through an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States between 1988 and 1999. It contains information on all of their post-IPO acquisitions and alliances, and on how their stock prices changed in response to the announcement of each deal. The results suggest that within the first year after IPO, investors expect firms to execute particular streams of alliances and acquisitions that reflect their unique histories of demonstrated capabilities. We also find evidence that investors cannot fully anticipate deal programs. The findings support a capabilities-based view of the firm and also show that accurate inference using event-study methods may require digging deep into the early histories of firms.

In this article we develop a theoretical framework to understand the causal relationships among (1) sustainable competitive advantage, (2) configuration, (3) dynamic capability, and (4) sustainable superior performance. We propose that a firm's competitive advantage, resource bundle configuration, and dynamic learning capability cannot be comprehended by outsiders. Its operational performance, however, can be captured by financial indicators. We promote an inductive Bayesian interpretation of the sustainable competitive advantage proposition. From this viewpoint, the presence or absence of competitive advantage may be reflected in the causal relationship between resource configuration, dynamic capability, and observable financial performance. We apply this theoretical framework to an example drawn from the global semiconductor industry, an area in which resource configuration and dynamic capability are essential to performance. The paper concludes with a summary of the proposed model and suggestions for future theoretical development of strategic management.

Additionally, despite calls from the upper-echelon literature, CEO personality research has been hobbled by the absence of a unifying construct that captures core dimensions of personality, and by the difficulty in obtaining such intimate assessments from executives. Building on recent advances in personality research, in particular the identification and validation of the core self-evaluation construct that captures the core facets of an executive's sense of self-potency, we develop and test a model of the impact of CEO core self-evaluation on entrepreneurial orientation. Then, consistent with upper echelons and personality theory, we specify the contingent role of environmental dynamism. Using multisource data from a sample of CEOs and their top management teams from 129 firms, including a time-lagged assessment of the firm's entrepreneurial orientation, we find evidence to suggest that CEOs whose personalities reflect higher core self-evaluations have a stronger positive influence on their firms' entrepreneurial orientation. In addition, we find that this influence is particularly strong in firms facing dynamic environments, but negligible in stable environments.

We explain why this sort of behavior unlocks additional potential for value creation, as well as the conditions that either facilitate or disrupt the value-creation process. Firms that manage for stakeholders develop trusting relationships with them based on principles of distributional, procedural, and interactional justice. Under these conditions, stakeholders are more likely to share nuanced information regarding their utility functions, thereby increasing the ability of the firm to allocate its resources to areas that will best satisfy them (thus increasing demand for business transactions with the firm). In addition, this information can spur innovation, as well as allow the firm to deal better with changes in the environment. Competitive advantages stemming from a managing-for-stakeholders approach are argued to be sustainable because they are associated with path dependence and causal ambiguity. These explanations provide a strong rationale for including stakeholder theory in the discussion of firm competitiveness and performance.

Because service intermediaries sit at the intersection of many firms, organizations and industries, they maintain extensive networks in a cluster. We propose that new ventures' ties with service intermediaries enable the ventures to plug into these networks and contribute to the ventures' product innovation by broadening the scope of their external innovation search and reducing their search cost. Moreover, we argue that the positive relationships between new ventures' ties with service intermediaries and their product innovation will become stronger when search in the networks in the cluster is more important to the ventures' product innovation.

We find that when an organization with an advantageous set of routines loses a key employee to a competitor, the advantaged organization's competitive position is reduced vis-\u00e0-vis the hiring competitor. What is more interesting is that we also show that the diffusion of an advantageous set of routines through the mobility of key employees may affect competitive advantage in at least two additional ways. Our findings result from an analysis of 412 competitive events between the San Francisco 49ers and all other teams in the National Football League during the 24-year period when the San Francisco 49ers perfected the routines of a strategic innovation that has become known as the West Coast Offense. First, we find that there is a loss of advantage for the organization when competitors increasingly compete against additional organizations that hired key employees from it. Second, we find that there is a loss of advantage for the organization when competitors expect future competition against additional organizations that hired key employees from it. Our results challenge the traditional argument that socially complex routines create sustainable competitive advantages because they are not easily imitated and do not rely on any single individual. Instead, we show that routines are stable to the loss of key employees, but the advantages derived from them are not.

Results from a sample of large public firms indicate that when members of this elite group were similar on a variety of dimensions, and thus likely to compare their pay, the board allowed less dispersion. In addition, pay dispersion was negatively related to company performance, particularly when it exceeded what could be justified by characteristics of the industry, firm, or team. But the strength of that relationship depended on how uniformly members of the team would benefit from subsequent performance gains. Specifically, the negative effect was particularly strong in firms where major differences in compensation\u2014that is, some executives were given significantly more stock options\u2014combined with a volatile stock price to provide only a few team members with the opportunity to realize very large financial gains in the future.

A possible agency problem arises with regard to monitoring implications as managers may be able to take advantage of compromised monitoring because overlapping owners may focus on the aggregate value for both the acquiring and the target firms and nonoverlapping owners may be interested only in the acquirer's side of the deal. The results suggest that when more owners overlap in their ownership of both the acquiring and target firms, the acquiring firms are more likely to experience decreased shareholder value through merger and acquisition deals.

One perspective intimates that technologically lagging firms stand to benefit more from exporting because exposure to technological knowledge in foreign markets allows these firms to close the gap with their more technologically endowed counterparts. A contrasting perspective posits that technologically superior firms benefit more from exporting since these firms are better equipped to translate knowledge acquired in foreign markets into innovation. Using a sample of 1,744 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990\u20131997, this study empirically investigates how exporting differentially influences the patent output of technologically leading versus technologically lagging firms. We find that exporting is associated with the ex post increase in innovative productivity for both technologically leading and lagging firms. However, subsequent to exporting, technologically leading firms apply for more patents than technologically lagging firms.

Grounding our work primarily with the resource- and dynamic capabilities-based views, we argue that increased diversity in partners' industry, organizational, and national background will incur added complexity and coordination costs but will provide broadened resource and learning benefits. Increased functional diversity results in a more balanced portfolio of exploration and exploitation activities that expands the firm's knowledge base while increased governance diversity inhibits learning and routine building. Hypotheses were tested with alliance portfolio and performance data for 138 multinational firms in the global automobile industry during the twenty-year period from 1985 to 2005. We found alliance portfolios with greater organizational and functional diversity and lower governance diversity were related to higher firm performance while industry diversity had a U-shaped relationship with firm performance. We suggest firms manage their alliances with a portfolio perspective, seeking to maximize resource and learning benefits by collaborating with a variety of organizations in various value chain activities while minimizing managerial costs through a focused set of governance structures.

We argue that resource heterogeneity may also arise when firms are deterred from a technological space upon being shown what resources rivals already possess within that space. To illustrate this deterrence effect, we use patent reexamination certificates, which indicate strategic stakes within a technological space without materially disclosing additional details of the underlying technologies and hence avoid the confounding effect of attracting competition through disclosure. We demonstrate how rivals' reexamination certificates within a technological space induce a firm to subsequently allocate less inventive effort in that space, based on two mechanisms\u2014indications of rivals' developmental speed and exclusionary ability. We further develop these two mechanisms by arguing that the deterrence effect is stronger when rivals' speed is enhanced by their downstream capabilities, or when rivals' exclusion is enhanced by their litigation experiences. Findings suggest that a firm's path of resource accumulation evolves through avoidance of rivals' paths, and deterrence may constitute a viable alternative theory of resource heterogeneity.

The framework takes a behavioral view of decision making and distinguishes two distinct decision-making processes. First there is the creative conceptualization of new resource configurations that are intended to deliver competitive advantage. Then there is the painstaking development of resources required to implement strategy. We argue that heterogeneity in the resources of rival firms arises from the interplay of these two processes: resource conceptualization and resource development. Heterogeneity spawns performance differences that can be explained ex ante from characteristics of managerial decision-making processes. We illustrate the approach in a simulated decision-making environment representing a highly competitive and dynamically complex industry. Results from repeated simulation experiments conducted with executive and MBA students show vast differences in performance among firms, even when they started with identical resource positions. In a departure from traditional resource-based literature, we explain how these differences stem from path dependent accumulation of resources and spontaneous variety in the way rivals conceptualize resources.

On the one hand, newly public acquirers may benefit from their pre-IPO affiliations through residual signaling value or/and resource-related benefits. On the other hand, newly public acquirers may suffer from those affiliations when conflicts of interests arise during the post-IPO period. Equity underwriters may have incentive to promote non\u2013value-creating acquisitions (Type II error), and venture capitalists (VCs) may have incentive to forgo strategically important acquisitions (Type I error). Drawing on a sample of 4,029 acquisitions made by 717 newly public firms, we find that on average the announcement of an acquisition by a newly public acquirer elicits a positive response from investors. The market views more favorably the acquisitions announced by newly public acquirers associated with prestigious equity underwriters, but this reaction becomes negative when the lead underwriter is retained as the acquisition advisor. The market reacts more favorably to acquisitions announced by VC-backed newly public acquirers, but only when those VCs are committed to a longer lockup period. The effects of pre-IPO affiliations on expected returns are stronger for newly public acquirers with a high intangible resource base and persist throughout the three-year post-IPO period (across each subsequent acquisition announcement).

We predict firms are constrained from making long horizon investments when short-term performance is poor\u2014and this effect is especially pronounced for young firms. Moreover, we argue that when managers hold high levels of exercisable stock options, their firms are less likely to make long-term investments. However, firms are more likely to pursue long horizon investments when managerial stock options are not yet exercisable. Based on analysis of investments made by cable television operators from 1972\u20131996, we find support for these predictions.

However, much of the extant work in this stream has examined the characteristics that resources must have in order to yield rents, while efforts to specify the crucial link between resources and value creation have been sparse. As a consequence, current theory is not sufficiently clear on how different kinds of resources and capabilities contribute to performance, nor does it clarify how firms can combine different resources and capabilities to achieve superior performance outcomes. Analyzing data obtained from 230 technology ventures with partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling and cluster analysis, this study seeks to improve understanding of the resource-performance link in two main ways. Based on a careful measurement of resources and capabilities in a well-defined functional area (sales and distribution), we first show how these resources and capabilities contribute to performance in that functional area. Second, we identify four clusters of firms that deploy different configurations of resources and capabilities.

It develops hypotheses that relate the intensity of the hypercompetitive environment and a firm's TMT dynamics to its action aggressiveness, or the volume and speed with which a firm engages its rivals. Using a survey-based sample of 104 Taiwanese firms, this study's findings show that the hypercompetitive environment and TMT sociobehavioral integration have direct and interacting effects on firms' action aggressiveness. Moreover, action aggressiveness is an important mediator between TMT integration and firm performance, particularly under hypercompetitive conditions. As such, the study contributes to our understanding of temporary advantage by revealing TMT integration and action aggressiveness as two essential organizational mechanisms for navigating in the hypercompetitive context. Finally, reflective of temporary advantage as a defining feature of hypercompetition, our findings show that performance variation is greater within this context. The article contributes to hypercompetition and competitive dynamics research by providing an integrated perspective of competitive behavior within the broad context of hypercompetitive environment, TMT dynamics, and firm performance.

The effects of competitive actions in disequilibrium environments, such as nascent markets, however, have not been examined. In this paper, we argue that under conditions of high ambiguity, firms can gain competitive advantage from the Gestalt properties present in the sequences of their competitive actions. Such properties, we argue, facilitate investor sensemaking and influence their valuations. Drawing on psychological research on pattern perception and holistic information processing, we investigate the effects of four Gestalt properties\u2014simplicity, predictability, grouping, and motif\u2014on investor valuations of new firms competing in the nascent markets that emerged around the commercialization of the Internet in the mid-1990s. We find support for our arguments that the dynamic properties of action sequences provide firms with advantages and that simplicity, grouping, and motif are associated with increases in the market value of high-ambiguity firms, but not of low-ambiguity ones. Our study advances research on competitive advantage by developing both theory and methods for studying how the dynamic, holistic properties of firms' competitive actions contribute to competitive advantage under varying levels of ambiguity.

In contrast, contemporary research has examined capability strengths while largely ignoring weaknesses. Addressing this oversight, we examine the direct and integrated effects of sets of capability strengths and capability weaknesses on competitive advantage and its empirical correlate\u2014relative performance. Additionally, we explore how environmental and firm-specific factors influence change in these drivers of competitive advantage over time. Results suggest that weakness sets have a negative effect on relative performance, while strength sets have an increasingly positive effect. The integrative effects of strength and weakness sets affect relative performance in a complex manner. For example, while high strength/low weakness firms perform at high levels, firms integrating high strength with high weakness perform well, but experience considerably more variance in their realized outcomes. Lastly, we find that the strength and weakness sets change significantly over time in markets where competition is more intense, thereby undermining the durability of competitive advantage. Our theory and results indicate that achieving temporary advantage is more difficult than previously thought and that the erosion of advantage occurs routinely as a result of dynamic and interactive rivalry.

In contrast, we focus on less stable markets where competitive advantages are temporary and R&D moves are essential. Using evolutionary search theory and an experiential simulation with in-depth fieldwork, we find that the relationship between performance and subsequent competitive moves depends on the type of market, not just on whether performance is high or low. High performers seek to maintain status quo, but this requires different strategies in different markets. They are conservative in established markets and bold in new ones. In contrast, low performers seek to disrupt the status quo. Again, this requires different strategies in different markets. Unlike high performers, low performers are bold in established markets and conservative in new ones where they lack understanding of how to disrupt rivals. Overall, our results incorporate unstable markets in theories of competitive dynamics and competitive interaction in theories of evolutionary search. By examining R&D moves, we also extend competitive dynamics research to include technology-based firms for whom temporary advantages are often essential.

It theoretically develops and empirically validates the idea that dynamically changing complementarity relationships among software product markets increase industry hypercompetition. The study also explains how dynamic capabilities for the management of complementary product markets can enable an independent software vendor (ISV) to create and renew temporary advantages. Specifically, an ISV can maintain or increase its performance rank in its product markets in three ways: (1) by competing with a portfolio of strongly complementary products; (2) by forming a product market portfolio that has strong complementarity relationships with other product markets in the industry; and (3) by dynamically and purposefully responding to the changing product market complementarities: (a) reconfiguring resource allocations of its products to strengthen the complementarities of its product portfolio and (b) undertaking entry and exit moves that reposition the portfolio in a stronger complementarity position. These dynamic capabilities enable the ISV to coevolve with the changing complementarities, change and improve its performance rank, and trigger new competitive moves by rivals; and accordingly, contribute to the escalation of rivalry in the industry. The study finds support for these ideas in a study of 1,200 ISVs from 1990 to 2002.

On the one hand, shorter-lived advantages induce leaders to develop new advantages faster. On the other hand, hypercompetition also erodes the expected returns from new advantages\u2014reducing leaders' incentives to accelerate investments. Since investing faster also raises costs, this article shows that leaders often prefer to renew competitive advantages more slowly in more hypercompetitive industries\u2014thereby increasing the probability of being displaced by competitors. This phenomenon is dubbed self-displacement. Firms' decision to self-displace themselves from industry leadership with greater probability is deliberate and rational\u2014not a result of leaders' inability to respond to competitive threats, as previously assumed in the literature. This article also shows that leaders' rule of thumb in more hypercompetitive environments should be to accelerate the development of advantages with high competitive value but low market value. This study is based on a theoretical model and numerical analysis grounded on stylized empirical facts that govern industry competitive macrodynamics and firm investment microdynamics in most industries. Because the model builds on empirically observable constructs, its theoretical propositions are amenable to large sample testing.

This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by diversifying the business\u2014that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership.

Predictions that the choice of market entry mode depends on \u2018relatedness\u2019 between the new product and the firm's existing products have repeatedly failed to gain empirical support. We resolve ambiguity in prior work by developing dynamic measures of relatedness, and by making a distinction between entries inside vs. outside a firm's primary business domain. Using a fine-grained dataset on the telecommunications sector, we find that inside a firm's primary business domain, acquisitions are used to fill persistent gaps near the firm's existing products, whereas outside that domain, acquisitions are used to extend the enterprise in new directions.

Theoretical models have clarified how and why differences in the extent of the interdependencies faced by firms across industries may affect the distributions of firm profits, but the specific predictions from these models have not been empirically tested. In this paper, we present what we believe is the first large scale empirical analysis linking differences in the extent of interdependencies across industries to differences in the distribution of firm profits within and across those industries. We use survey data to measure interdependencies systematically across a wide number of industries, thus addressing the primary obstacle to incorporating interdependencies in larger scale empirical work, and find evidence consistent with the theoretical predictions: average profitability is highest in industries with moderate levels of interdependency; the dispersion of profits among firms is higher in industries with more extensive interdependencies; and industries with more extensive interdependencies have a more positively skewed performance distribution. We find that the effect of interdependencies on average industry profitability is similar in scale to the effect of patent protection and industry growth rates, placing interdependency squarely among the strategy field's central concepts.

Drawing from agglomeration theory, which describes the benefit from colocating with competitors, we explicitly examine the combined impact of the competitive and agglomeration effects of entry using a unique dataset of Texas hotels. We find that incumbent establishments price higher when facing entrants whose agglomeration benefits are more likely to outweigh their competitive effects. This association is stronger for incumbents that have greater experience with entry. Our results bring a new perspective to the entry response literature helping clarify inconsistent empirical results. Further, we apply agglomeration theory to a new question, incumbent behavior, and demonstrate that experience appears to play an important role in recognizing situations that generate agglomeration externalities.

CEO origin, strategic change, and firm performance","In this study, we examine how the relationship between the level of strategic change in the pattern of resource allocation and firm performance differs between firms led by outside CEOs and those led by inside CEOs. Based on longitudinal data on the tenure histories of 193 CEOs who left office between 1993 and 1998, we find that the level of strategic change has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. As the level of change increases from slight to moderate, performance increases; as the level of change increases from moderate to great, performance declines. Further, we find that this inverted U-shaped relationship differs between firms led by outside CEOs and those led by inside CEOs. That is, both the positive effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively low and the negative effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively high are more pronounced for outside CEOs than for inside CEOs. Supplementary analyses also suggest that this difference between outside and inside CEOs exists in later years but not in the early years of CEO tenure.

How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that are bundled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also on their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm\u2014greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle.

Using survey data from 168 foreign subsidiaries operating in China, this study finds broad support for the proposed analytical framework. When the foreign subsidiary and supplier share common goals, the foreign subsidiary acquires greater levels of both explicit and tacit knowledge; trust between the two parties promotes the acquisition of greater levels of tacit than explicit knowledge. However, access to the local supplier network through the focal supplier enables the foreign subsidiary to acquire greater levels of explicit but not tacit knowledge. Formal contracts play a complementary role in knowledge acquisition: contracts enhance the acquisition of explicit knowledge and further strengthen the effects of relational mechanisms on tacit and explicit knowledge acquisition.

In this study, I explore the transaction cost implication of private branding, a practice whereby products supplied by unaffiliated manufacturers are sold under private brands owned by retailers. The main thesis is that private branding can preempt a special case of asset specificity called brand specificity, where retailers also invest in the marketing of an outsourced product, but subsequent reputation effects (positive or negative) are specific to the manufacturer who brands the product. Retailers, thus, will not be fully motivated to optimize their investment in product marketing unless they take over the branding right. With potential barriers to private branding being controlled, data obtained from a national chain reveal that the retailer deploys its marketing resources according to the branding status of a product, implying that private branding can deflect the transaction cost of solving the brand specificity problem. The results offer new theoretical insights into branding and transaction cost analysis. This efficiency-based approach to private branding also provides practitioners with useful guidelines for crafting a branding strategy that will facilitate cooperation between manufacturers and retailers.

Using plant-level data from the U.S. manufacturing sector, we measure the industry learning rate as the coefficient on cumulative output in a production function. We find that learning rates vary considerably among industries and are higher in industries with greater R&D, advertising, and capital intensity. More importantly, we find that higher rates of learning are associated with wider dispersion of Tobin's q and profitability among firms in the industry.

During the race to define a dominant design, individual firms attract the suppliers of complements by building alliance networks to favor the firms' preferred technology standard. Controlling for the number of suppliers in each technology standard community and the extent of technical progress achieved by individual firms, the panel data analysis shows that central firms with high ego network density, coupled with a strategic intent to acquire and share knowledge broadly within the technological community, achieve better innovation performance. The size of the technological community and some random events in the early formation of the industry do not provide a sufficient explanation of how these firms gain the diverse support of suppliers or enhance their competitive advantage. By demonstrating the independent and contingent effects of alliance network properties, this study explains how network patterns might enhance or limit the benefits of alliance networks when focal firms embrace different innovation strategies.

Based on arguments from several theoretical perspectives, namely economics, organizational ecology, and the resource-based view of the firm, we develop hypotheses that relate the survival of firms to the conditions confronted by firms at each moment and to those prevailing at the time of founding. We develop an empirical model that allows the effects of founding conditions to be transitory and estimate how long such effects last. The results of estimating such a model indicate that founding effects are important determinants of exit rates. Moreover, in most cases, their effect on survival seems to persist with little attenuation for several years following the founding of the firm. Overall, our findings suggest that there is no absolute superiority of any of the aforementioned theoretical perspectives over the others, and there are important elements in all of them to explain the survival of firms.

Gaps between employee and customer perceptions of corporate reputation have traditionally been associated with poor performance. In the context of service business and applying assimilation-contrast theory, we hypothesize that the nature of such gaps will, in reality, have a differential effect on future revenue depending on the size and valence of the gap. The effects of small gaps should be assimilated by customers, but larger ones have a greater potential of creating a contrast effect resulting in significant increases or decreases in subsequent sales. In businesses where employees have a more positive view of the company reputation than customers, we hypothesize a growth in future sales, and where they have a relatively more negative view, a decline. We test the effects of what we label as reputation gaps in 56 business units drawn from nine service organizations and confirm our hypotheses. Among the implications of our findings are that managing reputation by elevating employee perceptions of a company's reputation above those perceived by its customers holds the potential to enhance future sales.

We demonstrate that substantive cooperative strategies are more likely to be pursued by firms that enter a VA close to its initiation, while symbolic cooperation is more likely behavior by late joiners. We show that late joiners and early joiners within VAs adopt different cooperative strategies because they face different institutional pressures. Our analysis is based on the strategies of firms participating in the Climate Challenge program (1995\u20132000) established by the U.S. Department of Energy and representatives of the national electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our results show that early joiners were subjected to higher levels of political pressure at the state level and were more dependent on local and federal regulatory agencies than late joiners were. Early joiners were also better connected to the trade association and more visible. Late joiners had undertaken significantly less investment in environmental improvements than early joiners. Our paper also illustrates the difficulty involved in using VAs to try to induce improved environmental outcomes when there are no sanctioning mechanisms. Although early entrants reduced their emissions more than nonparticipants, our results show no significant difference overall between participants and nonparticipants in the reduction of their emissions.

Knowledge relatedness has typically been equated with knowledge similarity and the separate influence of knowledge complementarity has been overlooked. Similarly, studies examining innovation outcomes of M&As have typically focused on the role of technological knowledge and overlooked the influence of scientific knowledge. We develop a model of relatedness and invention performance of high-technology M&As that considers science and technology similarity and complementarity as important drivers of invention. We test the model using a sample of M&As from the drug, chemical, and electronics industries and a fine-grained measure of knowledge relatedness that distinguishes between science and technology relatedness. We find that complementary scientific knowledge and complementary technological knowledge both contribute to post-merger invention performance by stimulating higher quality and more novel inventions. This suggests that high-technology firms seeking acquisitions should search for, identify, and acquire businesses that have scientific and technological knowledge that is complementary to their own. Our results also suggest that similarities in knowledge facilitate incremental renewal, while complementarities would make discontinuous strategic transformations more likely, and that absorptive capacity research should be expanded to consider complementarities as well as similarities.

Contrary to popular time-management principles advocating task prioritization and focused sequential execution, we found that TMT polychronicity has a positive effect on firm performance in the context of dynamic unanalyzable environments. This effect is partially mediated by strategic decision speed and comprehensiveness. Our study contributes to research on strategic leadership by focusing on a novel value-based characteristic of the TMT (polychronicity) and by untangling the decision-making processes that relate TMT characteristics and firm performance. It also contributes to the attention-based view of the firm by positioning polychronicity as a new type of attention structure.

While Tsang's (2006) article rightly emphasizes the importance of realistic assumptions, it neglects the issue that certain kinds of assumptions are necessarily unrealistic for the roles that they play in theory development and testing. Therefore, researchers should not be criticized for making unrealistic assumptions of the latter kinds. Furthermore, by deliberating on the assumptions underpinning a theory, researchers can construct theories with better explanatory power and further develop existing theories. Tsang (2006) also suggests two approaches for testing assumptions, namely, a structural model and direct inquiry approaches. Although these approaches have certain merits, they also have limitations that may render the evidence gathered unreliable under certain situations. Two alternative approaches, namely, the experimental-causal-chain and the moderator-of-process designs, address these limitations. The researcher could consider adopting these designs as well in order to improve the rigor of assumption testing.

As capabilities are developed, those who are favored by knowledge asymmetries make decisions that balance value creation potential against the rent appropriation regime, such as the organizational form in which the capability will be embedded. Using the example of Apple's development of the iPod, this article illustrates how stakeholders plan for rent appropriation as they assemble new capabilities\u2014well before any value is actually created. Given that firm performance is an outcome of both capability development and rent appropriation, a robust theory must incorporate an understanding of how they coevolve.

We make a clear analytical distinction between scale free capabilities and those that are subject to opportunity costs and must be allocated to one use or another, thereby shifting the discourse back to Penrose's (1959) original argument regarding the stock of organizational capabilities. The existence of resources and capabilities that must be allocated across alternative uses implies that profit-maximizing diversification decisions should be based upon the opportunity cost of their use in one domain or another. This opportunity cost logic provides a rational explanation for the divergence between total profits and profit margins. Firms make profit-maximizing decisions to increase total profit via diversification when the industries in which they are currently competing become relatively mature. Due to the spreading of these capabilities across more segments, we may observe that firms' profit-maximizing diversification actions lead to total profit growth but lower average returns. The model provides an alternative explanation for empirical observations regarding the diversification discount. The self-selection effect noted in recent work in corporate finance may not be indicative of inferior capabilities of diversifying firms but of the limited opportunity contexts in which these firms are operating.

Further, for those ventures that achieve operation, individuals overestimate the expected future sales and employment. To explain variations in overoptimism, I posit that those individuals who adopt an inside view to forecasting through the use of plans and financial projections, will exhibit greater ex ante bias in their expectations.

Specifically, how does the density of informal networks affect an actor's ability to access and integrate diverse information and consequently that actor's innovation performance? The arguments are developed using the setting of 79 senior partners in a global management consulting firm and tested on a dataset of 1,449 informal relationships. I distinguish between internal, external, local, and global relations and find that this separation permits a more nuanced understanding of the effect of network structure on innovation performance. Specifically, I argue that the most effective network strategy is contingent upon the context in which the partners operate. The findings show that partners operating in homogeneous contexts, where the primary challenge is to access diverse information, benefit from low-density networks. In contrast, when crossing both firm and geographic boundaries, partners with dense networks have higher innovation performance. I argue that in such heterogeneous contexts, dense network interactions facilitate partners' ability to integrate the diverse information to which they are exposed.

By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

We focus on a specific corporate activity, namely corporate venture capital (CVC), describing minority equity investment by established-firms in entrepreneurial ventures. The setting offers an opportunity to compare corporate investors to investment experts, the independent venture capitalists (IVCs). On average, we observe a performance gap between corporate investors and their independent counterparts. Interestingly, the performance gap is sensitive to CVCs' compensation scheme: it is the largest when CVC personnel are awarded performance pay. Not only do we study the association between incentives and performance but we also document a direct relationship between incentives and the actions managers undertake. For example, we observe disparity between the number of participants in venture capital syndicates that involve a corporate investor, and those that consist solely of IVCs. The disparity shrinks substantially, however, for a subset of CVCs that compensate their personnel using performance pay. We find a parallel pattern when analyzing the relationship between compensation and another investment practice, staging of investment. To conclude, the paper investigates the three elements of the principal-agent framework, thus providing direct evidence that compensation schemes (incentives) shape investment practices (managerial action), and ultimately investors' outcome (performance).

Using data from 123 U.S.-based MNEs over a seven-year period and leveraging both sales-based and subsidiary-based measures for diversification, we find that performance increases at an increasingly higher rate as firms concentrate more heavily on intra-regional diversification. Regarding inter-regional diversification and total geographic diversification, we find inverted-U relationships to exist between firm performance and the level of geographic diversification.

In this study, we advance the literature by examining the effect of the diversity of FDI country origins on the productivity of domestic firms. We propose that the diversity of FDI country origins can facilitate FDI spillovers by increasing the variety of technologies and management practices brought by foreign firms, to which domestic firms are exposed and that they can potentially utilize. Further, the extent to which domestic firms can utilize these technologies and practices depends upon their absorptive capacity. Using panel data on Chinese manufacturing firms during the period 1998\u20132003, our results support these propositions. We find that the diversity of FDI country origins in an industry has a positive relationship with the productivity of domestic firms in the industry. This positive relationship is stronger when domestic firms are larger, and when the technology gap between FDI and the domestic firms is intermediate.

We consider a setting in which a shift to stricter legal liability regimes not only increases the expected damage payments from the auditor to investors in case of audit failure, but also increases litigation frictions such as attorneys' fees. The main finding is that the relationship between the strictness of the legal regime and the probability of client rejection is U\u2010shaped.

Managers' nickel forecasts are not simply a benign response to uncertainty about upcoming earnings, because nickel forecasts are not only less accurate, but also they are more optimistically biased than non\u2010nickel forecasts. In addition to uncertainty, efforts to protect the firm's proprietary information and self\u2010serving opportunism in response to managers' economic incentives also play incremental roles in explaining managers' propensity to issue forecasts heaped at nickel intervals.

This study considers the effect of discriminability on agent performance. We find that (1) agent performance improvement is positively associated with the degree of discriminability, (2) subjective measures are inferior to objective measures in providing incentives to the agent because of the lack of discriminability, and (3) the inferiority of subjective measures for incentive purposes is exacerbated in circumstances in which the discriminability gap between objective and subjective measures is significant.

Guided by Support Theory, we experimentally investigate how the specificity of fraud risk documentation during audit planning influences auditors' subsequent audit work. We also examine the effect of priming auditors about the fraud risks identified during planning before they begin subsequent evidence evaluation. We find that auditors' planning stage efforts affect subsequent fraud risk assessments and evidence evaluation decisions. Unprimed auditors who receive more specific documentation increase their fraud risk assessments and evidence requests. Priming's effects are more complex. Priming auditors who receive summary documentation also increases fraud risk assessments and evidence requests; however, priming auditors who receive specific documentation reduces these judgments because the priming makes the client\u2010specific risks seem less typical. Accordingly, the PCAOB's call for more documentation can have the unintended consequence of reducing auditors' sensitivity to fraud.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/2/547/3214/The-Influence-of-Documentation-Specificity-and","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditing and fraud risk assessments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We have thus chosen a setting that gives independence impairment its best chance of being detected if it exists. Using a large sample of private Norwegian firms, we analyze whether auditors who receive higher fees are less likely to issue modified opinions. Despite the low litigation risk and the reduced reputation risk, our empirical results provide no evidence that auditors compromise their independence through fee dependence. These results are robust to controlling for the expected portion of fees, to different sample specifications, to the use of both levels and changes specifications, and to a number of sensitivity analyses.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/2/573/3157/Auditor-Independence-in-a-Private-Firm-and-Low","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditor independence without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

Although the tax asymmetry by itself may not be enough to enable separation, we show how it would nevertheless contribute to the efficiency of separation through explicitly dissipative signals.

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission asserts that effective internal control monitoring should enhance the efficiency of internal control processes, and, in turn, the assurance over such processes (COSO 2009a). We develop hypotheses to test the realization of these potential benefits. Specifically, we identify a sample of firms that implemented internal control monitoring technology in response to the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Consistent with our hypotheses, we document that the implementation of internal control monitoring technology is associated with lower likelihood of material weaknesses, smaller increases in audit fees, and smaller increases in audit delays during the post-SOX time period. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for research related to continuous monitoring, client-provided assurance assistance, and information technology governance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/3/1001/3244/Examining-the-Potential-Benefits-of-Internal","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal control monitoring technology and its efficiency benefits, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using data from a confidential survey taken in 1999 of Chief Financial Officers, we develop and test a theory for choosing between these two methods of evaluating a tax department. We find that the likelihood of evaluating the tax department as a profit center is increasing in firm decentralization characteristics and tax-planning opportunities. We then employ instrumental variables to investigate whether evaluating a tax department as a profit center provides an effective incentive for the tax department to contribute to net income through lower ETRs.

Dechow (2006) conjectures that Leone et al.\u2019s (2006) results might be due to the sign of stock returns misclassifying firm performance. Using three-way performance partitions, we find no asymmetry in CEO cash compensation for firms with low stock returns. Further, we find that CEO cash compensation is less sensitive to poor earnings performance than it is to better earnings performance. Thus, we find no evidence consistent with ex post settling up for poor firm performance, even among the very worst performing firms with strong corporate governance. We find similar results when examining changes in CEO bonus pay and when partitioning firm performance using earnings-based measures. In sum, our results suggest that CEO cash compensation is not punished for poor firm performance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/3/1065/3229/Is-CEO-Cash-Compensation-Punished-for-Poor-Firm","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CEO compensation and its relationship with firm performance, lacking any references to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Psychological research on motivated reasoning suggests that managers will evaluate and interpret data in ways consistent with preferences, increasing their tendency to arrive at conclusions that are consistent with their desired conclusions (Kunda 1990). Consistent with that research, results of my study show that managers who are involved in selecting strategic initiatives perceive those initiatives as having been more successful than managers who are not involved in the initiative-selection process (holding constant actual scorecard performance). Results suggest further that simply framing the scorecard as a causal chain is not sufficient to mitigate these effects. However, framing the scorecard as a causal chain, in conjunction with involving managers in the selection of scorecard measures, mitigates the effects of motivated reasoning tied to manager involvement in initiative selection.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/3/1095/3211/The-Balanced-Scorecard-as-a-Strategy-Evaluation","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['motivation', 'evaluation', 'involvement']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of strategy evaluation and managerial psychology, with minimal reference to social justice or ethical considerations.

Thus, within the class of models framing the recent discussion, there is no impact on the ex ante cost of capital covering the full time span of the firm.

Using two-stage cross-sectional regression tests, we find that the AQ risk factor is significantly priced, after controlling for low-priced stocks. This result is robust in tests using individual stocks, various portfolio formations, and different beta estimations. Furthermore, we show that AQ and its pricing effect systematically vary with business cycles and macroeconomic variables. In particular, this pricing effect is prominent in total AQ and innate AQ but not in discretionary AQ. The risk premium associated with AQ exists only in economic expansion but not in recession periods. Poorer AQ firms are more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. The risk premium and the dispersion of AQ are also related to future economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that AQ contributes to the cost of equity capital and that its pricing effect is associated with fundamental risk.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/3/937/3171/Accruals-Quality-Stock-Returns-and-Macroeconomic","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accruals quality and its impact on financial metrics, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The magnitude of the bias is larger when firms compete in more profitable product markets and smaller when the firm can extract more information about its rival\u2019s costs from its own.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has raised concerns about auditors\u2019 fraud judgments and the quality of their brainstorming sessions. We develop a measure of brainstorming quality to examine how it affects auditors\u2019 fraud decision-making processes. We test our measure using field survey data of auditors\u2019 actual brainstorming sessions for 179 audit engagements. Respondents report considerable variation in the quality of brainstorming in practice. We find some evidence that high-quality brainstorming improves the relations between fraud risk factors and fraud risk assessments. We also determine that brainstorming quality positively moderates the relations between fraud risk assessments and fraud-related testing. Our results suggest that the benefits of brainstorming do not apply uniformly, because low-quality sessions likely incur the costs of such interactions without receiving the attendant benefits. By documenting best practices from high-quality brainstorming sessions, our findings can inform auditors on how to improve their consideration of fraud.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/4/1273/3178/Auditors-Use-of-Brainstorming-in-the-Consideration","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['fraud', 'brainstorming', 'audit']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing and fraud consideration without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, she further notes that this relation disappears when contemporaneous accruals are dropped from the core earnings expectations model. McVay (2006) calls for research to improve the core earnings expectations model and to provide additional cross-sectional tests of classification shifting. Using a core earnings expectations model that is not dependent on accrual special items, we show that classification shifting is more likely in the fourth quarter than in interim quarters. We also find more evidence of classification shifting when the ability of managers to manipulate accruals appears to be constrained and in meeting a range of earnings benchmarks. Overall, our evidence provides broad support for McVay\u2019s (2006) conclusion that managers engage in classification shifting.

Regulators and standard-setters are considering the adoption of principles-based accounting standards to reduce such opportunism. We report the results of an experiment in which experienced financial managers, with incentives to structure a transaction off balance sheet, take a reporting position on how a lease is to be reported. We manipulate the type of accounting standards (principles-based, rules-based) and the type of auditor (principles-oriented, rules-oriented, or client-oriented). Results show that for a rules-based standard, auditor-type does not influence participants\u2019 propensity to report the transaction off balance sheet. However, for a principles-based standard, auditor-type matters in that this propensity is lowest when the auditor is principles-oriented as opposed to rules- or client-oriented.

Accordingly, the relation between prior period intangible returns and future period returns subsumes the relation between current period accruals and future returns. In addition, I link the accrual anomaly and the value/growth anomaly to a common economic mechanism (intangible returns) and show that a strong negative relation between external financing activities and future returns is not subsumed by the accrual anomaly.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/4/1347/3151/Intangible-Returns-Accruals-and-Return-Reversal-A","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and financial anomalies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The increased recurrence of supposedly nonrecurring items perhaps reflects managerial shifting of (more permanent) ordinary expenses to a transitory category or, alternatively, may reflect an environment where these items naturally occur more frequently. Either scenario suggests that these repetitive charges have future earnings implications dramatically different from truly nonrecurring events and should therefore be valued more like a recurring component of earnings. Consistent with this notion, we find that as the frequency of reporting negative special items increases (measured by the presence of multiple prior charges), the persistence of these items significantly increases with respect to future earnings. Our evidence also suggests that the valuation multiple on such charges increases with frequency. That is, the market values \u201crecurring nonrecurring\u201d items more like the other components of recurring earnings.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/5/1577/3210/The-Persistence-and-Market-Valuation-of-Recurring","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to market valuation and does not address any socially progressive themes or issues of diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2010","85","5","Mei Feng; \n\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Mei Feng\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Pittsburgh\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n                                Sarah McVay\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Sarah McVay\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        The University of Utah\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar","Analysts\u2019 Incentives to Overweight Management Guidance When Revising Their Short-Term Earnings Forecasts","We document that, when revising their short-term earnings forecasts in response to management guidance, analysts wishing to curry favor with management weight the guidance more heavily than predicted, based on the credibility and usefulness of the guidance.

Negotiation theory shows that negotiators\u2019 initial positions (e.g., clients\u2019 unaudited balances) as well as feelings of reciprocity created by prior negotiations serve to create expectations for the current negotiation and, in turn, affect the outcomes of such negotiations. Our results show that the magnitude of an audit difference involving an estimate (i.e., difference between client\u2019s account balance and the auditor\u2019s independent estimate) as well as the presence of a prior client concession influence auditors\u2019 negotiation expectations. Specifically, auditors proposed smaller adjustments when the magnitude of the audit difference was high and when the client conceded on an audit issue prior to resolving the difference in estimates. These manipulations similarly influence the negotiated outcome, and this influence is fully mediated by the auditor\u2019s initial negotiation position.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/5/1647/3223/The-Effect-of-Magnitude-of-Audit-Difference-and","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit negotiations without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

However, subordinates\u2019 judgments are only one input into audit team judgments. How do supervisors finalize audit team judgments after actively intervening in their subordinates\u2019 judgments? In an experiment using audit teams, supervisors with weaker or stronger goals to reach a client-preferred conclusion either were or were not asked to first actively coach a subordinate\u2019s judgment (i.e., active intervention) before reviewing it and finalizing the audit team\u2019s judgment. Supervisors\u2019 intervention influenced subordinates\u2019 inputs, which, in turn, supervisors incorporated into their final judgments. More interestingly, intervention biased supervisors\u2019 final judgments, controlling for supervisor directional goal strength and for concurrent effects on subordinates\u2019 inputs. However, supervisors distorted their judgments less as they perceived a larger technical knowledge advantage over subordinates. In a second experiment, auditors appear aware of the bias-reducing knowledge advantage effects but unaware of the bias-increasing active intervention effects. We discuss implications for audit team judgments and audit quality control.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/5/1763/3162/The-Effects-of-a-Supervisor-s-Active-Intervention","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['intervention', 'judgments', 'bias']","The article discusses the influence of a supervisor's intervention on subordinates' judgments, which touches on ethical considerations in decision-making but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We also examine whether this relation differs across large banks whose managements are required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act to evaluate internal control over financial reporting and whose auditors must attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls, and small banks that are not subject to those requirements. We find that unexpected auditor fees are unrelated to earnings management for large banks. For small banks, we find greater earnings management via under-provisioning of LLP by banks that pay higher unexpected total and nonaudit fees to the auditor. These results suggest that auditor fee dependence on the audit client is associated with earnings management via abnormal LLP and is a potential threat to auditor independence for small banks. Our findings are relevant to policymakers contemplating new regulations in light of the recent banking crisis.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/6/2011/3213/An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Auditor-Independence-in","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['auditor independence', 'earnings management', 'regulations']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditor independence and earnings management without any explicit mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

I find that earnings forecast revisions supplemented with sales forecast revisions have a greater impact on security prices than do stand-alone earnings forecast revisions, controlling for the incremental information content in sales forecasts. Supplemented earnings forecasts are more accurate ex post, controlling for other individual analyst characteristics. Results are robust to controlling for earnings persistence and time effects. Taken as a whole, financial analysts are more likely to supplement their earnings forecasts with sales forecasts when they have better information. Supplementary sales forecasts appear to lend credibility to earnings forecasts because financial analysts provide sales forecasts when they are more informed.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/6/2047/3221/Do-Supplementary-Sales-Forecasts-Increase-the","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a substantially larger sample than previous studies, we observe negative excess returns when the going concern audit report (GCAR) is disclosed. We find that the reaction is more negative if the GCAR cites a problem with obtaining financing, suggesting that the GCAR provides new information to investors. Also, the reaction is more adverse if the GCAR triggers a technical violation of a debt covenant that restricts the firm from getting a GCAR. The evidence suggests that institutional investors drive the reaction to the GCAR, since there is no detectable reaction at low levels of institutional ownership. The market reaction gets more negative as the level of institutional ownership increases, and there is a decline in institutional ownership after the GCAR is issued. We attribute these results to sophisticated investors\u2019 awareness of the firm\u2019s financing needs and the covenants carried by the firm\u2019s debt.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/85/6/2075/3235/Investor-Reaction-to-Going-Concern-Audit-Reports","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of investor reactions to audit reports without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.
