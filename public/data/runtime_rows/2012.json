Our longitudinal case study documents an organization's canceled merger effort and a failed attempt to return to the organization's widely accepted premerger strategy.

An Examination of Antecedents and Consequences of Ethical Leadership","Drawing on social learning and moral identity theories, this research examines antecedents and consequences of ethical leadership. Additionally, this research empirically examines the distinctiveness of the ethical leadership construct when compared to related leadership constructs such as idealized influence, interpersonal justice, and informational justice. Consistently with the theoretically derived hypotheses, results from two studies of work units (n's = 115 and 195 units) provide general support for our theoretical model. Study 1 shows positive relationships between ethical leadership and leader \u201cmoral identity symbolization\u201d and \u201cmoral identity internalization\u201d (approaching significance) and a negative relationship between ethical leadership and unit unethical behavior and relationship conflict. In Study 2, both leader moral identity symbolization and internalization were positively related to ethical leadership and, with idealized influence, interpersonal justice, and informational justice controlled for, ethical leadership was negatively related to unit outcomes.

Yet surprisingly little is known about whether these processes combine over time in ordered ways, because most research on learning explores one particular process. Using theory elaboration and theory-building methods and data on the accumulated country entries of entrepreneurial firms, we address this gap. Our core contribution is an emergent theoretical framework that develops the concept of learning sequences. We find that learning sequences exist and are influenced by initial conditions. We also find that learning sequences evolve in fundamentally distinct ways over time and with repeated use. Finally, data show how different learning sequences differentially affect both shorter- and longer-term performance, suggesting that it matters which learning processes are used and when.

However, behavioral agency model predictions are inconsistent with the well-accepted premise that family firms have a long-term investment orientation. We reconcile these seemingly incompatible predictions by adding insights from the myopic loss aversion framework, which deals with the impact of decision-making time horizons. The combination of these two prospect theory derivatives led us to hypothesize that family firms usually invest less in R&D than nonfamily firms but the variability of their investments will be greater owing to differences in the compatibility of long- and short-term family goals with the economic goals of a firm. However, when performance is below aspiration levels, we theorize that family goals and economic goals tend to converge. In this situation, the R&D investments of family firms are expected to increase and the variability of those investments decrease, relative to nonfamily firms.

As hypothesized, firms with higher levels of wrongdoing experience less positive media coverage; however, this decline is mitigated during periods of higher industry wrongdoing. Additionally, we find support for a negative spillover effect: the tenor of media coverage about a focal firm is less positive if others in its industry recall products.

Researchers have recently argued that new institutional practices reflect settlements or truces reached by organizations embedded within fields but, to date, there is a dearth of research on how these settlements are negotiated. Based on a study of the formal negotiation of, and settlement on, ISO 26000, a new international standard defining the normative domain of corporate social responsibility (CSR), this research draws from a cognitive perspective to develop and test an organizational model of settlement on a new institutional practice. Findings point to the important roles of logic pluralism within organizations and organizational negotiation frames as determinants of settlement and the creation of new institutional practices. Contrary to traditional expectations in the literature on institutional conformity, the moderating effect of an organization's embeddedness in the negotiation process did not facilitate settlement.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.1045","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","7","['social responsibility', 'institutional practices', 'negotiation', 'corporate social responsibility', 'normative']","The article discusses the negotiation of the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility, emphasizing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the creation of new institutional practices.

Findings provide limited support for simple trickle-down mechanisms of ethical leadership but broader support for a multilevel model that takes into account how leaders embed shared understandings through their influence on the ethical culture of units at various levels, which in turn influence followers' ethical cognitions and behavior.

In an in-depth study of 17 multinational corporations involving 359 interviews with internal and external actors, we find that firms facing identical pressures decouple policy from practice in different ways and for different reasons. When firms' responses are generated locally, without firmwide coordination, these responses can be either intentional or emergent. In the presence of information asymmetry between firms and their stakeholders, we find that managers' responses are intentional (\u201cfaking it\u201d) and depend on how they perceive their interests. In the presence of competing stakeholder expectations, responses are emergent (\u201cmuddling through\u201d) and depend on the degree of consensus among managers in their readings of the environment.

Analyses of longitudinal multilevel data collected from 5,270 employees in 175 business units of a hospitality company demonstrate a significant three-way interactive effect of unit-level job satisfaction trajectory and its dispersion and individual job satisfaction trajectory on individual job exit. In particular, in the presence of a negative unit-level job satisfaction trajectory and low dispersion, a positive change in individual-level job satisfaction does not affect the odds of a person leaving an organization. Put differently, an employee's being out of step with prevailing unit-level attitudes appears to alter the relationship between his or her job satisfaction trajectory and turnover propensity. Further, unit-level job-satisfaction change and its dispersion jointly influence the overall turnover rate in a unit. The results indicate unit-level and individual-level job satisfaction trajectories have unique multilevel influences on turnover above and beyond static levels of job satisfaction. Accounting for these dynamics substantially increases the explained variance in turnover behavior. The findings increase understanding of the job satisfaction\u2013turnover link over time and across levels.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0920","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['job satisfaction', 'turnover', 'employee', 'unit-level']","The article discusses job satisfaction and turnover, which are relevant to employee well-being but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

Drawing on self-determination theory, a theory of total motivation that combines both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we find that the prestige associated with being a director, the ability to have influence, and identification with the director role make directors less likely to exit; however, demotivating factors related to the time commitment required, such as holding other board appointments or serving as a CEO at another company, increase the likelihood of director exits. Finally, we find that the value of being on the board of a prestigious firm diminishes when the firm experiences events that tarnish its prestige, although these same events decrease the likelihood of director exit when firm prestige is lacking.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.1083","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on governance and director motivations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Specifically, we propose that a firm's position in an industry divestiture wave conveys information about whether or not managers are imitating their industry peers, which in turn will influence how investors perceive and assess the quality of the decision and its likely performance consequences. Supporting this theoretical argument, we find that the relationship between divestiture position and stock market returns exhibits a U-shaped pattern, with divestitures that occur at the peak of an industry divestiture wave generating the lowest stock market returns. We also find that industry characteristics (e.g., munificence) reinforce the effect of position in wave on investor response.

The embeddedness of founding teams in a community logic makes them more committed and more capable of attracting local support, resulting in greater establishment rates for their enterprises. By contrast, embeddedness in a financial logic leads to more likely team dissolution. High embeddedness in both logics simultaneously has a positive effect on the likelihood of establishment in stable economic periods, but a negative effect in turbulent periods. Qualitative evidence suggests that the existence of factions in a founding team\u2014more likely in turbulent periods\u2014could account for such a difference. Drawing on a mix of archival data on bank founding teams and interview data, this article links logics, founder backgrounds, and entrepreneurial success. Variation in founder backgrounds influences establishment rates for reasons that can be traced back to community and financial logics. This study thus links literatures on competing logics, founder motivations, and entrepreneurship.

Here we develop a theoretical perspective that explicitly focuses on irresponsibility and that particularly helps explain attributions of social irresponsibility in the minds of the firm's observers. In contrast to approaches in the corporate social responsibility literature that tend to deemphasize the role of the individual perceiver of firm behavior in favor of emphasizing such broader social structures as value systems, institutions, and stakeholder relations, our focus is on how the social reality of external expectations for social responsibility is rooted in the perceptions of the beholder. We draw on attribution theory to describe how attributions of irresponsibility stem from the observer's subjective assessments of effect undesirability, corporate culpability, and affected party noncomplicity. We describe how those assessments affect each other and how they are influenced by the observer's perceptions of effect and firm characteristics and by the observer's social identification with the affected party or the implicated corporation.

I outline the foundations of such variability through simultaneous consideration of the extent to which a given interaction is (1) depleting of regulatory resources and (2) generative of three particular resources shown to compensate for the effects of ego depletion. Beyond the depleting interactions that have been the focus of research to date, the resulting typology reveals two restorative interaction types (replenishing and breakthrough) that I theorize positively shape compassionate care provision in both the short and long term. Replenishing interactions primarily serve as a regulatory break with momentary effects on caregivers' subsequent ability to self-regulate, while breakthrough interactions have a more lasting effect on caregivers' positive professional identity.

I conducted a multimethod field study of 78 audit and consulting teams from two global professional firms, revealing an irony of team life: even though motivated to perform well on a high-stakes project, pressured teams are more likely to engage in performance-detracting behaviors. Survey results show that, as performance pressure increases, team members begin to overly rely on general expertise while discounting domain-specific expertise, leading to suboptimal performance. I then use longitudinal qualitative case studies of six project teams across two firms to explore the underlying behavioral mechanisms that generate this outcome. Results reveal four limiting team processes: (1) a drive toward consensus, (2) a focus on common knowledge, (3) a shift from learning to project completion, and (4) increased conformity to the status hierarchy. Results also show that only domain-specific expertise\u2014the kind that teams underuse when facing higher pressure\u2014increases client-rated team performance.

Audiences that are \u201cmarket-takers\u201d consume or evaluate goods and use market labels to find and assess organizations; for them, ambiguous labels make organizations unclear and therefore less appealing. \u201cMarket-makers\u201d are interested in redefining the market structure, and as a result, this type of audience sees the same ambiguity as flexible and therefore more appealing. I tested these ideas in a longitudinal analysis of U.S. software organizations between 1990 and 2002. As predicted, organizations that claim ambiguous labels are less appealing to consumers, an audience of market-takers, but more appealing to venture capitalists, who are market-makers. Further, when labels are ambiguous, aversion to or preference for ambiguity arises from the label itself. Identifying with multiple ambiguous labels does not make an organization even less appealing to a consumer or more appealing to a venture capitalist. Finally, all types of venture capitalists are not alike in how they react to a label\u2019s ambiguity.

Eggers","Falling Flat: Failed Technologies and Investment under Uncertainty","This study theorizes about the behavioral and knowledge creation implications of betting on the losing technology in a competing technology situation and focuses on three main outcomes. First, in a situation with competing technological options, firms that invest initially in the losing technology will be less successful subsequently in building new knowledge in the winning technology because their experience with failure will lead them to update their expectations of the industry and choose to pursue less risky alternatives. Second, two classic risk-reducing strategies\u2014investing in both technologies or entering after uncertainty is resolved\u2014will not be completely effective. Firms investing in both technologies are likely to suffer the incentive and coordination-driven innovation penalties of generalists, while late entrants will suffer learning disadvantages. Third, the possession of key and relevant complementary assets\u2014upstream and downstream\u2014will positively moderate the observed inertial effect on firms that backed the failed technology and generalists that backed both technologies, as these complementary assets will increase incentives to adapt to the winning technology. I find empirical support for my hypotheses using a novel data set on the evolution of the global flat panel display industry from 1964 to 2003 to investigate the technological competition between plasma and liquid crystal displays. Results show that firms initially pursuing plasma generated less subsequent knowledge in liquid crystal displays, and that firms betting on both technologies were also slow to build knowledge in liquid crystal displays. Meanwhile, firms with upstream and downstream complementary assets were able to moderate, but not overcome, this barrier to knowledge creation. The findings have implications for our study of technological evolution and adaption, for learning from failure and reinforcement learning, and for the relationship between resource partitioning and adaptation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212447181","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technological investment strategies and outcomes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We argue that benefits received through exchange foster group identification and solidarity but that this effect is stronger in generalized exchange systems\u2014in which giving and receiving of resources occurs unilaterally among three or more individuals\u2014than direct exchange systems\u2014which feature reciprocal transfers of resources between two people. At low levels of benefit to recipients, generalized and direct exchange systems will produce similarly low levels of group identification. At high levels of benefit, however, generalized exchange will result in relatively higher levels of identification. Higher levels of identification leads individual members in turn to view the group as higher in solidarity. We find support for this mediated moderation model in two survey-based case studies of organizations designed to facilitate these forms of exchange: one of Freecycle, a large-scale, online generalized exchange system, the other of Craigslist, a comparable direct exchange system. The results further suggest that generalized exchange is likely to emerge where a critical mass of exchange benefits creates positive sentiments toward the group, sentiments that help fuel further contributions in the exchange system.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212448626","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['solidarity', 'group identification', 'exchange systems']","The article discusses themes of solidarity and group identification, which align with social cohesion and collective well-being, indicative of moderate woke themes.

Empirical evidence from the field shows that even a modest increase in group-level privacy sustainably and significantly improves line performance, while qualitative evidence suggests that privacy is important in supporting productive deviance, localized experimentation, distraction avoidance, and continuous improvement.

Drawing from social exchange theory, our theoretical perspective suggests how IM support may result from norms of reciprocity among corporate leaders. We consider the potential for direct and generalized reciprocity in the provision of IM support, including generalized reciprocity in which CEOs who received IM support previously pay the support forward to another third-party CEO, and a second form of generalized reciprocity in which CEOs reciprocate IM support to fellow CEOs whom they believe have given similar support to other CEOs in the past. We also draw from the social psychological literature on persuasion to suggest why IM support for another CEO may have a more positive influence on the tenor of journalists\u2019 coverage about the firm\u2019s leadership than impression management by the CEO about his or her own leadership and strategy. We test our hypotheses with data from large and mid-sized public U.S. companies from 1999 to 2007, including original survey data from a large sample of CEOs and journalists.

Focusing on the division of value between a firm and its employees, we theorize that following a change in the organizational incentive structure, employees learn, over time and with experience, how to be more productive under the implied objectives of the incentive regime, as well as how to game or exploit it. Results, based on outlet-level data from a Polish commercial bank over a 13-month period, show that the bank outlets\u2019 value creation (sales revenue from primary loans) and value appropriation (the sum of outlet employees\u2019 monthly bonus) both increased, at a decreasing rate, over time as outlet employees gained experience under the new incentive regime. In parallel, the bank\u2019s share (the percentage of value created by outlets retained by the bank) increased at first, then, after reaching a plateau, decreased continuously, indicating that the ability of the incentive regime to induce the intended results evolved, giving rise to an incentive life-cycle. In exploring the underlying micromechanisms, we found strong quantitative and qualitative evidence for the presence and relative paces of productive and adverse learning in bank outlets, as well as for the role of prior experience. This is the first empirical study to show that individual and organizational learning processes can influence the evolution of the division of value between economic actors.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212453833","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['value division', 'incentive structure', 'organizational learning']","The article discusses the division of value between firms and employees, which touches on themes of fairness and organizational dynamics, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

Though the opacity of a practice is typically thought to impede diffusion, a political-cultural approach to institutions suggests that opacity can sometimes play a positive role. Given that adoption decisions are embedded in a web of conflicting interests, transparency may bring negative attention that, when observed by prospective adopters, inhibits them from following suit. Opacity, in contrast, helps avoid that cycle. Using the curtailment of health benefits for retirees among large U.S. employers (1989 to 2009), we compare the diffusion of transparent adoptions (i.e., partial or complete benefit cuts) with opaque adoptions (i.e., spending caps that trigger disenrollment). We find that transparent adoptions reduce subsequent diffusion of the practice to other organizations. This effect is fully mediated by negative media coverage, which is itself conditioned by the presence of opposition from interest groups. Opaque adoptions, in contrast, increase subsequent diffusion to other organizations and are facilitated by the involvement of professional experts. Thus, in addition to providing findings on practice opacity, our study contributes insight into how organizational fields shape diffusion by illuminating the role of third parties in the spread of controversial practices.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212465077","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","4","['opacity', 'transparency', 'controversial practices', 'interest groups']","The article discusses the implications of practice opacity and transparency in organizational settings, touching on the influence of interest groups and media coverage, which suggests a moderate engagement with ethical considerations and social dynamics.

Theories of entrepreneurship and industry evolution suggest two opposing hypotheses: as an industry develops, launching a new venture may become more difficult for all but industry insiders and the socially prominent because of competition from large incumbents, or it may become easier for all people because the legitimacy accorded to the industry simplifies the entrepreneurial task. To test these two conflicting claims, we study the American magazine industry from 1741 to 1860. We find that magazine publishing was originally restricted to publishing-industry insiders, professionals, and the highly educated, but most later founders came from outside publishing and more were of middling stature. Gains by entrepreneurs from the social periphery, however, were uneven: most were doctors and clergy without college degrees in small urban areas; magazines founded by industry insiders remained predominant in the industry centers.

A basic question is whether they incubate challenges to authority. We suggest that free spaces foster collective empowerment when they assemble large numbers of people, arouse intense emotion, trigger collective identities, and enable individuals to engage in costly collective action. We analyze challenges to authority that invite repression: mutinies of regiments in the East India Company\u2019s Bengal Native Army in India in 1857. We take advantage of an exogenous source of variation in the availability of free spaces\u2014religious festivals. We predict that mutinies are most likely to occur at or right after a religious festival and find that the hazard of mutiny declines with time since a festival. We expect community ties to offer alternate avenues of mobilization, such as when regiments were stationed close to the towns and villages from which they were recruited. Moreover, festivals are likely to be more potent instantiations of free spaces when regiments were exposed to an oppositional identity, such as a Christian mission. Yet even free spaces have a limited ability to trigger collective action, such as when the political opportunity structure is adverse and prospective participants are deterred by greater chances of failure. These predictions are supported by analyses of daily event-history data of mutinies in 1857, suggesting that free spaces are an organizational weapon of the weak and not a substitute for dissent.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212467744","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['collective empowerment', 'challenges to authority', 'mutinies', 'oppositional identity', 'free spaces']","The article discusses themes of collective empowerment and challenges to authority, indicating a strong focus on social justice and the dynamics of power within organizational contexts.

When introducing a new product, a software vendor may employ behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD) by offering a discount over its market price to entice existing customers of the competitor. This type of pricing is referred to as competitive upgrade discount pricing and is possible because the vendor can use proof of purchase of a competitor's product as credible evidence to offer the discount. At the same time, the competitor may offer a discount to its own previous customers in order to induce them to buy its upgrade. We formulate a game-theoretic model involving an incumbent and entrant where both firms can offer discounts to existing customers of the incumbent. Although several equilibrium possibilities exist, we establish that an equilibrium with competitive upgrade discount pricing is observed only for a unique market structure and a corresponding unique set of prices. In this equilibrium, instead of leveraging its first mover advantage, the incumbent cedes market share to the entrant. Furthermore, the profits of both the incumbent and the entrant reduce with switching costs. This implies that the use of BBPD has product design implications because firms may influence the switching costs between their products by making appropriate compatibility decisions. In addition, lower switching costs result in reduced consumer surplus. Hence, a social planner may want to increase switching costs. The resulting policy implications are different from those prevalent in other industries such as mobile telecommunications where the regulators reduced switching costs by enforcing number portability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0291","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['consumer surplus', 'social planner', 'market structure']","The article discusses competitive pricing strategies and their implications for consumer surplus and market dynamics, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Our analysis identifies two important learning effects\u2014the extraction and the deception effects\u2014as having significant welfare implications. Both these effects arise because of a bidder's desire to gain an informational advantage relative to his competitors, but their manifestations are different. The extraction effect occurs because of a bidder's incentive to learn about his competitors, and the deception effect is a consequence of the incentive to prevent an opponent from gaining the information. Both effects lead to higher bid prices, and either may be dominant from a procurer surplus standpoint. With the deception effect, social welfare can decrease even when the number of suppliers increases, a result that is counterintuitive.

Correspondingly, outsourcing contracts typically specify a variety of metrics to measure and reward (or penalize) vendor performance. The specific types of performance metrics included in a contract strongly affect its incentive content and ultimately its outcome. One specific challenge is the measurement of performance when an outsourcing arrangement has a mix of objectives, some that are highly measurable and others that are not. Recent advances in contract theory suggest that the design of incentives for a given objective is affected by the characteristics of other objectives. However, there is little empirical work that demonstrates how relevant these \u201cmultitask\u201d concerns are in real-world contracts. We apply contract theory to examine how objectives and incentives are related in IT outsourcing contracts that include multiple objectives with varying measurement costs. In our context, contracts generally share the objective of reducing IT costs but vary in the importance of increasing IT quality. We establish empirical results about performance measurement in IT outsourcing contracts that are consistent with recent theoretical propositions. We find that the use of strong direct incentives for a given measurable objective is negatively correlated with the presence of less measurable objectives in the contract. We show that outsourcing contracts that emphasize goals with high measurement costs employ more performance metrics than initiatives whose objectives have a lower measurement cost profile. Surprisingly, as the number of performance metrics increases, satisfactory outcomes decrease, which we explain within a multitask theory framework.

Compared with the prevailing proprietary approaches, open-source software products are developed by co-opting external developers and prospective users. Although a core group of developers might still play a key role in the initial design and development, a notable aspect of the open-source software paradigm is the role of peripheral developers in the enhancement and popularization of the product. Peripheral developers are not formal members of the core development team. They voluntarily contribute their time and creative talent in improving the quality of the product or in popularizing the product through word-of-mouth advocacy. As volunteers, they are not subject to the traditional hierarchical controls, nor are they contractually obligated. Peripheral developers represent a novel and unique aspect of open-source software development, and there is a greater interest in tapping their potential. However, there has been limited evidence about how and when their participation has beneficial impacts. We examine how peripheral developers contribute to product quality and diffusion by utilizing longitudinal data on 147 open-source software products. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis indicates that peripheral developers make significant contributions to product quality and diffusion, especially on projects that are in the more mature stages of product development.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0311","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['open-source', 'volunteers', 'contribute']","The article discusses the role of peripheral developers in open-source software, highlighting voluntary contributions and collaboration, which suggests a focus on community and inclusivity.

One of the expected consequences is an increase in the price elasticity of demand, or the percent change in demand caused by a percent change in price, because consumers are better able to compare offerings from multiple suppliers. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the Internet on demand, by comparing the demand functions in the Internet and traditional air travel channels. We use a data set that contains information for millions of records of airline ticket sales in both online and offline channels. The results suggest that consumer demand in the Internet channel is more price elastic for both transparent and opaque online travel agencies (OTAs), in part, because of more leisure travelers self-selecting the online channel, relative to business travelers. Yet, after controlling for this channel self-selection effect, we still find differences in price elasticity across channels. We find that the opaque OTAs are more price elastic than the transparent OTAs, which suggests that product information can mitigate the price pressures that arise from Internet-enabled price comparisons. We discuss the broader implications for multichannel pricing strategy and for the transparency-based design of online selling mechanisms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0312","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand elasticity in the air travel industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Movies","Collaborative filtering algorithms learn from the ratings of a group of users on a set of items to find personalized recommendations for each user. Traditionally they have been designed to work with one-dimensional ratings. With interest growing in recommendations based on multiple aspects of items, we present an algorithm for using multicomponent rating data. The presented mixture model-based algorithm uses the component rating dependency structure discovered by a structure learning algorithm. The structure is supported by the psychometric literature on the halo effect. This algorithm is compared with a set of model-based and instance-based algorithms for single-component ratings and their variations for multicomponent ratings. We evaluate the algorithms using data from Yahoo! Movies. Use of multiple components leads to significant improvements in recommendations. However, we find that the choice of algorithm depends on the sparsity of the training data. It also depends on whether the task of the algorithm is to accurately predict ratings or to retrieve relevant items. In our experiments a model-based multicomponent rating algorithm is able to better retrieve items when training data are sparse. However, if the training data are not sparse, or if we are trying to predict the rating values accurately, then the instance-based multicomponent rating collaborative filtering algorithms perform better. Beyond generating recommendations we show that the proposed model can fill in missing rating components. Theories in psychometric literature and the empirical evidence suggest that rating specific aspects of a subject is difficult. Hence, filling in the missing component values leads to the possibility of a rater support system to facilitate gathering of multicomponent ratings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0336","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of collaborative filtering algorithms and their performance in generating recommendations, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Research also suggests that IT is vital to intermediate processes such as those that produce intangible output. Among these, the use of IT in innovation and knowledge creation processes is perhaps the most critical to a firm's long-term success. However, little is known about the relationship between IT, knowledge creation, and innovation output. In this study, we contribute to the literature by comprehensively examining the contribution of IT to innovation production across multiple contexts using a quality-based measure of innovation output. Analyzing annual information from 1987 to 1997 for a panel of large U.S. manufacturing firms, we find that a 10% increase in IT input is associated with a 1.7% increase in innovation output for a given level of innovation-related spending. This relationship between IT, research and development (R&D), and innovation production is robust across multiple econometric methodologies and is found to be particularly strong in the mid to late 1990s, a period of rapid technological innovation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of IT in creating value at an intermediate stage of production, in this case, through improved innovation productivity. However, R&D and its related intangible factors (skill, knowledge, etc.) appear to play a more crucial role in the creation of breakthrough innovations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0338","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['innovation', 'IT investment', 'productivity']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of IT investment and its impact on innovation productivity, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals' choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process. Our results are in sharp contrast to earlier models of diffusion, such as the Bass model, that do not distinguish between different social processes that are responsible for the process of diffusion. Our results are robust to potential self-selection according to user tastes, temporal heterogeneity and the reflection problem.

Although the information systems field increasingly recognizes that switching costs plays a big part in enforcing loyalty, little is known about what factors users regard as switching costs or why they perceive these costs. Consequently, it is hard for online services to know what lock-in strategies to use and when to apply them. We address this problem by first developing a theory-driven structure of online users' perceived switching costs that distinguishes between vendor-related and user-related factors. We then propose that important antecedent influences on switching costs from economic value, technical self-efficacy, and past investments are more complex and intertwined than previously thought. We empirically validated the proposed model using data collected from home users of Internet service providers. Our findings demonstrate that an online service's economic value more heavily influences users' perceptions of vendor-related switching costs than does technical self-efficacy. However, users' technical abilities outweigh economic value in influencing user-related switching costs. Furthermore, although we confirmed the commonly held notion that deeply invested users are generally more vulnerable to lock-in, we also found that this relationship is contingent on users' technical abilities. Finally, we found that our multidimensional measure of switching costs is a valid predictor of user loyalty and is more powerful than previous global measures. Overall, this study uncovered a finer network of switching-cost production than had been previously established and suggests a new approach to modeling and exploiting online users' perceived switching costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0340","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of user behavior and switching costs in online services without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Numerous surveys, however, suggest consumers often conduct pre-purchase searches for high-involvement products (e.g., digital cameras) and visit external WOM websites during the search process. In this study, we analyze the relative impact of external and internal WOMs on retailer sales for high-involvement products using a panel of sales and WOM data for 148 digital cameras from Amazon.com and three external WOM websites (Cnet, DpReview, and Epinions) over a four-month period.

This paper explores the parallel market evolution of the two main categories of wireless services\u2014voice and data\u2014in leading technology markets, inspecting the differences and complex interactions between the associated adoption processes. We propose a model that addresses specific individual characteristics of these two services and the stand-alone/add-on relationship between them. In particular, we acknowledge the distinction between the nonoverlapping classes of basic consumers, who only subscribe to voice plans, and sophisticated consumers, who adopt both services. We also account for the fact that, unlike voice services, data services rapidly evolved over time due to factors such as interface improvement, gradual technological advances in data transmission speed and security, and the increase in volume and diversity of the content and services ported to mobile Internet. Moreover, we consider the time gap between the market introduction of these services and allow for different corresponding consumer learning curves. We test our model on the Japanese wireless market. The empirical analysis reveals several interesting results. In addition to an expected one-way effect of voice on data adoption at the market potential level, we do find two-way codiffusion effects at the speed of adoption level. We also observe that basic consumers impact the adoption of wireless voice services in a stronger way compared to sophisticated consumers. This, in turn, leads to a decreasing average marginal network effect of voice subscribers on the adoption of wireless voice services. Furthermore, we find that the willingness of voice consumers to consider adopting data services is positively related to both time and penetration of 3G-capable handsets among voice subscribers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0346","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of telecommunications and market analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2012","23","1","Robin WilliamsRobin Williamsrobin.williams@ed.ac.ukInstitute for the Study of Science, Technology, and Innovation, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH1 1LZ, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author, Neil PollockNeil Pollockneil.pollock@ed.ac.ukUniversity of Edinburgh Business School, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author","Research Commentary\u2014Moving Beyond the Single Site Implementation Study: How (and Why) We Should Study the Biography of Packaged Enterprise Solutions","The single site implementation study is an invaluable tool for studying the large-scale enterprise solution.

We discuss better spatial metaphors that might help us explore the hybrid and extended spaces in which packaged software systems develop and evolve.

These customer-driven IT spillovers result from customers' IT investments in various information systems that reduce transaction costs through information sharing and coordination and lead to more efficient production and logistics upstream. The magnitude of IT spillovers depends on relative industry concentration because customers in more concentrated industries relative to those of their suppliers are better able to retain the benefits from their IT investments. We model customer-driven effects based on production theory and empirically test the model using two industry-level data sets covering different and overlapping time periods (1987\u20131999 and 1998\u20132005), different scopes of the economy (manufacturing only versus all industries), and different levels of industry aggregation. We find that, given an increase in a downstream industry's IT capital, there is a significant increase in downstream industry output as well as significant increases in upstream industry output. Moreover, the magnitude of IT spillovers is related to relative industry concentration: A 1% decrease in a customer's relative industry concentration increases spillovers by roughly 1%. Thus, further increases in IT capital can be justified along the supply chain, and an industry's relative concentration\u2014which can reflect market power\u2014in part determines the distribution of productivity benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0345","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT spillovers and productivity without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

An Economic Analysis of Document Duplication in Cooperative Web Caching","Cooperative caching is a popular mechanism to allow an array of distributed caches to cooperate and serve each others' Web requests. Controlling duplication of documents across cooperating caches is a challenging problem faced by cache managers. In this paper, we study the economics of document duplication in strategic and nonstrategic settings. We have three primary findings. First, we find that the optimum level of duplication at a cache is nondecreasing in intercache latency, cache size, and extent of request locality. Second, in situations in which cache peering spans organizations, we find that the interaction between caches is a game of strategic substitutes wherein a cache employs lesser resources towards eliminating duplicate documents when the other caches employs more resources towards eliminating duplicate documents at that cache. Thus, a significant challenge will be to simultaneously induce multiple caches to contribute more resources towards reducing duplicate documents in the system. Finally, centralized decision making, which as expected provides improvements in average latency over a decentralized setup, can entail highly asymmetric duplication levels at the caches. This in turn can benefit one set of users at the expense of the other, and thus will be challenging to implement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0347","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['asymmetric', 'resources', 'users']","The article primarily focuses on technical and economic aspects of cooperative caching without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Possible explanations of this price dispersion, derived mainly using hedonic price models, have seen only modest success. In this paper, we propose a competitive model based on online retailers' differentiation mainly in service provided and recognition enjoyed to explain price dispersion. Our exploratory empirical analyses, using cross-sectional data, demonstrate that the competitive model provides a better explanation of the association between prices and online retailers' service and recognition levels. In addition, our competitive model is able to explain observations that are seemingly inconsistent with the hedonic model such as the negative association between service and price. This paper contributes to the literature on price dispersion by offering a differentiation model that provides a good fit with data and by proposing a theory that explains previous counterintuitive observations of prices.

This paper examines whether such a lock-in strategy will indeed benefit proprietary software vendors facing competition from open-source software, who can credibly commit future prices. Developing a two-period duopoly model in which software products are differentiated and customers are heterogeneous, we find that the lock-in strategy is actually counterproductive in competing against open-source software. In fact, giving customers the freedom of choice may end up benefiting the proprietary software vendor. In terms of the broader effect, we find that lock-in reduces overall social welfare, but certain customers may actually be better off with it. Finally, we show that the lock-in strategy works differently for different types of customers in the software market (i.e., foresighted versus myopic customers). This suggests that customer behavior could significantly alter the equilibrium strategy of software vendors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0358","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['social welfare', 'freedom of choice', 'customers']","The article discusses the broader effects of lock-in strategies on social welfare and customer choice, hinting at ethical considerations in software competition.

Although a number of companies realize the potential of blogs and encourage their employees to blog, a good chunk of them are skeptical about losing control over this new media. Companies fear that employees may write negative things about them and that this may bring significant reputation loss. Overall, companies show mixed response toward negative posts on employee blogs\u2014some companies show complete aversion; others allow some negative posts. Such mixed reactions toward negative posts motivated us to probe for any positive aspects of negative posts. In particular, we investigate the relationship between negative posts and readership of an employee blog. In contrast to the popular perception, our results reveal a potential positive aspect of negative posts. Our analysis suggests that negative posts act as catalyst and can exponentially increase the readership of employee blogs, suggesting that companies should permit employees to make negative posts. Because employees typically write few negative posts and largely write positive posts, the increase in readership of employee blogs generally should be enough to offset the negative effect of few negative posts. Therefore, not restraining negative posts to increase readership should be a good strategy. This raises a logical question: what should a firm's policy be regarding employee blogging?

We vary the level of uncertainty in the transaction environment, and measure the effects of this manipulation on buyers' trust and their subsequent rating behaviors. We distinguish between a reputation mechanism and specific reputation information, finding the former has an association with the overall decision of whether to transact in the marketplace, while the latter shows significance in purchase decisions regarding specific sellers. We also find that aggregate reputation information is weighted differently than singular reputation information. Finally, we show that when reputations are increasingly noisy, buyers are less likely to react negatively to poor ratings and are more likely to give sellers the benefit of the doubt when seemingly uncooperative outcomes occur.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0362","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['reputation', 'trust', 'transactions']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of online reputation systems and buyer-seller interactions without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The only study in virtual teams, which examined poorly functioning teams, found that controls increased the salience of poor behavior, which decreased trust. We argue that in virtual teams behavioral controls amplify the salience of all behaviors (positive and negative) and that an individual's selective perception bias influences how these behaviors are interpreted. Thus the link from behavioral controls to trust is more complex than first thought. We conducted a 2 \u00d7 2 experiment, varying the use of behavioral controls (controls, no controls) and individual team member behaviors (reneging behaviors designed to reduce trust beliefs and fulfilling behaviors designed to increase trust beliefs). We found that behavioral controls did amplify the salience of all behaviors; however, contrary to what we expected, this actually weakened the impact of reneging and fulfilling behaviors on trust. We believe that completing a formal evaluation increased empathy and the awareness of context in which the behaviors occurred and thus mitigated extreme perceptions. We also found that behavioral controls increased the selective perception bias which induced participants to see the behaviors their disposition to trust expected rather than the behaviors that actually occurred.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0364","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'behavioral controls', 'virtual teams']","The article discusses trust and behavioral controls in virtual teams, which touches on interpersonal dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity or ethics.

These architectures are implemented as services, which typically use XML-based messaging to communicate between service consumers and service providers across enterprise networks. We propose a scheme for caching fragments of service response messages to improve performance and service quality in service-oriented architectures. In our fragment caching scheme, we decompose responses into smaller fragments such that reusable components can be identified and cached in the XML routers of an XML overlay network within an enterprise network. Such caching mitigates processing requirements on providers and moves content closer to users, thus reducing bandwidth requirements on the network as well as improving service times. We describe the system architecture and caching algorithm details for our caching scheme, develop an analysis of the expected benefits of our scheme, and present the results of both simulation and case study-based experiments to show the validity and performance improvements provided by our caching scheme. Our simulation experimental results show an up to 60% reduction in bandwidth consumption and up to 50% response time improvement. Further, our case study experiments demonstrate that when there is no resource bottleneck, the cache-enabled case reduces average response times by 40%\u201350% and increases throughput by 150% compared to the no-cache and full message caching cases. In experiments contrasting fragment caching and full message caching, we found that full message caching provides benefits when the number of possible unique responses is low while the benefits of fragment caching increase as the number of possible unique responses increases. These experimental results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0368","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical improvements in service-oriented architectures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

IT has permeated every corner of firms. Firms have reached the current state in their use of IT because IT has provided myriad opportunities for firms to improve performance and, firms have availed themselves of these opportunities. Some have argued, however, that the opportunities for firms to improve their performance through new uses of IT have been declining. Are the opportunities to use IT to improve firm performance diminishing? We sought to answer this question. In this study, we develop a theory and explain the logic behind our empirical analysis; an analysis that employs a different type of event study. Using the volatility of firms' stock prices to news signaling a change in economic conditions, we compare the stock price behavior of firms in the IT industry to firms in the utility and transportation and freight industries. Our analysis of the IT industry as a whole indicates that the opportunities for firms to use IT to improve their performance are not diminishing. However, there are sectors within the IT industry that no longer provide value-enhancing opportunities for firms. We also find that IT products that provided opportunities for firms to create value at one point in time, later become necessities for staying in business.

Although a considerable body of literature exists on the issue of data quality, there has been little research done at the task level of a business process to develop effective control strategies to mitigate data quality risks. In this paper, we present a methodology for managing the risks associated with the quality of data in accounting information systems. This methodology first models the error evolution process in transactional data flow as a dynamical process; it then finds optimal control policies at the task level to mitigate the data quality-related risks using a Markov decision process model with risk constraints. The proposed Markov decision methodology facilitates the modeling of multiple dimensions of error dependence, captures the correlated impact among control procedures, and identifies an optimal control policy. A revenue realization process of an international production company is used to illustrate this methodology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0371","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['data quality', 'risk', 'compliance']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of data quality and risk management within accounting information systems, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The enterprise system is introduced in accordance with the logic of managerial rationalism, but some of the institutional logics that organizational actors draw upon and reproduce contradict the logic of managerial rationalism in certain situations. In these situations, organizational actors loosely couple elements of their practices from the practices implied by the enterprise system, thus satisfying the demands associated with both institutional fields. We identify four generalizable forms of loose coupling that result from these institutional contradictions: temporal, material, procedural, and interpretive, and discuss their effects on both the system implementation and local practices. Further, we show how, through the use of institutional logics, researchers can identify fundamental institutional contradictions that explain regularities in the situated responses to enterprise system implementations\u2014regularities that are consistently identified in the literature across a variety of organizational contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0373","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['institutional logics', 'contradictions', 'organizational practices']","The article discusses institutional contradictions and diverse logics within an organization, which hints at a recognition of complexity in organizational behavior.

Going beyond the ad hoc heuristic approaches applied in previous studies, we empirically validate the existence of several patterns of supply-side technology relationships in the context of wireless networking. We use vector autoregression (VAR) to model the comovements of new component, product, and infrastructure introductions and provide evidence of strong Granger-causal interdependencies. We also demonstrate that substantial improvements in forecasting can be gained by incorporating these cross-level effects into models of technological change. This paper provides some of the first research that empirically demonstrates these cross-level effects and also provides an exposition of VAR methodology for both analysis and forecasting in IS research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0418","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information systems and technological change without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The present research effort posits that these mixed findings may potentially be explained by two factors: (1) CRM technology use may have different effects on different customers, and (2) different CRM tools may have different performance consequences. This study investigates this possibility by building on relationship marketing and management theory to propose and test a model of the customer- and firm-level consequences of the organizational use of CRM interaction support and customer prioritization tools. The results of data analysis of 295 customer firms nested within 10 provider firms reveal that firm use of CRM interaction support tools is positively related to customers' relationship perceptions, regardless of customer account size. In contrast, the data indicate that use of CRM prioritization tools appears to have positive effects on a firm's larger customers and negative effects on smaller customers. The results also suggest that when considered at an aggregate level, customer perceptions of the exchange relationship are predictive of organizational performance and that the association between these two variables is significant for larger customer accounts but insignificant for smaller accounts. Overall, the study's results help explain some of the inconsistent findings reported in the literature regarding the performance implications of CRM technology use and suggest that use of the technology may serve to enhance organizational performance, at least over the short term.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0419","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['customer relationship management', 'organizational performance', 'customer perceptions']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of CRM technology and its performance implications without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper builds upon a market-based framework presented by Guo et al. (Guo, Z., G. J. Koehler, A. B. Whinston. 2007. A market-based optimization algorithm for distributed systems. Management Sci. 53(8) 1345\u20131458), where a distributed system optimization problem is solved by self-interested agents iteratively trading bundled resources in a double auction market run by a dealer. We extend this approach to a dynamic, asynchronous Internet market environment and investigate how various market design factors including dealer inventory policies, market communication patterns, and agent learning strategies affect the computational market efficiency, market liquidity, and implementation. We prove finite convergence to an optimal solution under these various schemes, where individual rational and budget-balanced trading leads to an efficient auction outcome. Empirical investigations further show that the algorithmic implementation is robust to a number of dealer and agent manipulations and scalable to larger sizes and more complicated bundle trading markets. Interestingly, we find that, though both asynchronous communication and asymmetric market information negatively affect the speed of market convergence and lead to more agent welfare loss, agents' ability to predict market prices has a positive effect on both. Contrary to conventional wisdom that a dealer's intertemporal liquidity provisions improve market performance, we find that the dealer's active market intervention may not be desirable in a simple market trading environment where an inherent market liquidity effect dominates, especially when the dealer owns a significant amount of resources. Different from the traditional market insight, our trading data suggest that high trading volume does not correlate to low price volatility and quicker price discovery.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0366","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market design and resource allocation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet, there has been little analysis of the drivers and performance effects of the information structure of BPO relationships, including its linkages to the underlying contractual structure. This study integrates perspectives in neo-institutional economics and information processing to develop and test the theoretical argument that the extent of use and performance effects of the information structure of the BPO relationship are greater in time and materials BPO contracts than in fixed-price BPO contracts. Survey data on 134 BPO relationships provide empirical support for our hypotheses. The synergistic impact of incentives and information on BPO performance emphasizes that their joint assessment is necessary to enhance the explanatory power of extant theories of organization. This result also has implications for achieving maximum benefits from complex BPO arrangements that are more likely to be characterized by time and material contracts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0374","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of business process outsourcing without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this research, we propose an alternative release policy for custom-built enterprise-level software projects that allows testing to continue for an additional period after the software product is released. Our analytical results show that the software release policy with postrelease testing has several important advantages over the policy without postrelease testing. First, the total expected cost is lower. Second, even though the optimal time to release the software is shortened, the reliability of the software is improved throughout its lifecycle. Third, although the expected number of undetected bugs is higher at the time of release, the expected number of software failures in the field is reduced. We also analyze the impact of market uncertainty on the release policy and find that all our prior findings remain valid. Finally, we examine a comprehensive scenario where in addition to uncertain market opportunity cost, testing resources allocated to the focal project can change before the end of testing.

We collect a unique data set of over 10 million e-mail advertisements sent by a website to over 600,000 customers who could buy the advertised products from the online merchant. We estimate a two-stage hierarchical model using Bayesian analysis to account for observable and unobservable consumer heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests several interesting results regarding consumers' responses to firms' use of information. When firms use product-based personalization (where the use of information is not explicitly mentioned), consumers respond positively. On the other hand, consumers respond negatively when firms are explicit in their use of personally identifiable information (i.e., a personalized greeting). We also find that negative responses to personalized greetings are moderated by consumers' familiarity with firms. The main contribution of this study is that it not only indicates the economic benefits of personalization in e-mails but also highlights consumers' concerns over the use of information in personalization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0384","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['personalization', 'consumer concerns', 'information use']","The article discusses consumer concerns regarding the use of personally identifiable information, which touches on ethical implications of data use in marketing.

Recently, competitive intelligence (CI) has emerged as an important area within business intelligence (BI) where the emphasis is on understanding and measuring a firm's external competitive environment. A requirement of such systems is the availability of the rich data about a firm's competitors, which is typically hard to acquire. This paper proposes a method to incorporate competitive intelligence in BI systems by using less granular and aggregate data, which is usually easier to acquire. We motivate, develop, and validate an approach to infer key competitive measures about customer activities without requiring detailed cross-firm data. Instead, our method derives these competitive measures for online firms from simple \u201csite-centric\u201d data that are commonly available, augmented with aggregate data summaries that may be obtained from syndicated data providers.

The research methods are grounded in action research, participatory design, and situation-awareness oriented design. The completion of a more than two-year industrial secondment and six-month field studies ensured that a full understanding of user requirements had been obtained. A service-centered architecture was proposed to satisfy these user requirements. The proposed architecture consists mainly of information gathering, database management, and decision support services. The decision support services include situational overview, instant risk assessment, emergency response preplan, and disaster development prediction. Abstracting from the experience obtained while building this system, we outline a set of design principles in the general domain of information systems (IS) development for emergency management. These design principles form a contribution to the information systems literature because they provide guidance to developers who are aiming to support emergency response and the development of such systems that have not yet been adequately met by any existing types of IS.

Data were gathered across several units within a large organization: immediately after the implementation, six months after the implementation, and one year after the implementation. Social network analysis was used to understand the effects of network structures, and hierarchical linear modeling was used to capture the multilevel effects at unit and individual levels. At the unit level of analysis, we found that centralized structures inhibit implementation success. At the individual level of analysis, employees with high in-degree and betweenness centrality reported high task impact and information quality. We also found a cross-level effect such that central employees in centralized units reported implementation success. This suggests that individual-level success can occur even within a unit structure that is detrimental to unit-level success.

Empirical Evidence from a Call Center","Firms are investing millions to deploy Web-based self-services at their call centers. The rationale for such investment is that the firm's cost of interacting with its customers through the Web-based channel is an order of magnitude cheaper than the assisted channels such as telephony. We conduct a field study at the call center of a prominent U.S. health insurance firm to examine this cost-saving rationale of the Web-based self-service channel. On the one hand, the Web channel may substitute for the telephony channel in some cases. On the other hand, the Web also exposes customers to a vast amount of information about their health policy, claims, and coverage; this information can create uncertainty leading to customers seeking more information and hence making more telephone calls. We designed a quasi-natural experiment in our field setting and used difference-in-difference specifications to show that the Web-based self-service usage leads to a 14% increase in telephone calls. We conduct several robustness checks to show that our specifications are robust to any potential selection of customers in the Web-based self-service usage. We further find that the impact of Web portal usage is moderated by the Web portal characteristics. We find that if the information is unambiguous and easily retrievable on the Web, calls for such information decline by 29%. However, for ambiguous information, the calls increase substantially. Our research provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of self-service technologies design.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0390","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the cost-effectiveness of web-based self-service in call centers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a formal model of pricing models in online advertising using the principal\u2013agent framework to study the two most popular pricing models: input-based cost per thousand impressions (CPM) and performance-based cost per click-through (CPC). We identify four important factors that affect the preference of CPM to the CPC model, and vice versa.

Newer software development paradigms such as component-based and model-driven development attempt to overcome this challenge by emphasizing modular design of complex systems. However, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research on the use of such software methodologies and the associated extent to which trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility can be influenced. Addressing this gap, we investigate the performance outcomes of a model-driven, component-based software development methodology using data collected from an enterprise software development firm that deployed such a methodology for its product development processes. Examining the design, development, and implementation of 92 business software components of the firm's enterprise resource planning product, we discuss how the design of software components, specifically component granularity, affects development efficiency (development effort and defects) and flexibility (customization effort). Our results suggest that (a) components that are coarse grained are associated with higher flexibility (lower customization effort) but are also associated with lower development efficiency (more development effort and defects), and (b) defect proneness of a component plays a mediating role on the relationship between component granularity and flexibility. These findings present strong evidence for the existence of trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility in mass-customized software product life cycles. They establish component granularity as a key design dimension that needs to be managed judiciously to enable potential trade-off shifting mechanisms through the use of software methodologies that emphasize modular design approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0392","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development efficiency and flexibility without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, analysis of the expanded panel suggests that (a) IT returns are substantially lower in midsize firms than in Fortune 500 firms; (b) they materialize more slowly in large firms\u2014in midsize firms, unlike in larger firms, the short-run contribution of IT to output is similar to the long-run output contribution; and (c) the measured marginal product of IT spending is higher from 2000 to 2006 than in any previous period, suggesting that firms, and especially large firms, have been continuing to develop new, valuable IT-enabled business process innovations.

Healthcare informaticians have suggested that electronic health record systems (EHRS) can facilitate information sharing within and between healthcare stakeholders such as physician practices, hospitals, insurance companies, and laboratories. We examine the assimilation of EHRS in physician practices through a novel and understudied theoretical lens of physicians' identities. Physician practices and the physicians that lead them occupy a central position in the healthcare value chain and possess a number of unique characteristics that differentiate them from other institutional contexts, including a strong sense of affiliation with other physicians, potent professional identities, and a desire for autonomy. We investigate two salient physician identities, those of careprovider and physician community, grounded in the roles physicians play and the groups with which they affiliate. We argue that these identities and their evolution, triggered by EHRS, manifest as both identity reinforcement and deterioration, and are important drivers of EHRS assimilation. We use survey data from 206 physician practices, spread across the United States, to test our theoretical model. Results suggest that physician community identity reinforcement and physician community identity deterioration directly influence the assimilation of EHRS. We further find that the effects of careprovider identity reinforcement and careprovider identity deterioration on EHRS assimilation are moderated by governmental influence. Theoretical and pragmatic implications of the findings are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0407","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['identity', 'physician community', 'careprovider']","The article explores the evolution of physician identities in the context of electronic health records, touching on themes of community and professional identity.

There is a considerable amount of literature on advertising games between firms, yet introducing an IT capacity constraint fundamentally changes this problem. In the presence of information processing constraints, although advertising may still cause a customer to switch, it may not result in a sale, i.e., the customer may be lost by both firms. This situation could occur when customers have a limited tolerance for processing delays and leave the website of a firm because of slow response. In such situations, attracting more traffic to a firm's site (by increasing advertising expenditure) may not generate enough additional revenue to warrant this expenditure. We use a differential game formulation to obtain closed-form solutions for the advertising effort over time in the presence of IT capacity constraints. Based on these solutions, we present several useful managerial insights.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0377","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising strategies and IT constraints without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An important feature of an online discussion community is its content boundaries, which are individual perceptions of what materials and discussions are part of the community and what are not, and how that community is related to others within a larger system. Yet in spite of its importance, many community infrastructures allow individual participants to reshape content boundaries by simultaneously associating their contributions with multiple online discussion communities. This reshaping behavior is a controversial aspect of the creation and management of many types of online discussion communities. On one hand, many communities explicitly discourage boundary reshaping behaviors in their frequently asked questions or terms-of-use document. On the other hand, community infrastructures continue to allow such reshaping behaviors. To explain this controversy, we theorize how the extent of boundary reshaping in an online discussion community has simultaneously positive and negative effects on its member dynamics and responsiveness. We test predictions about the conflicting effects of reshaping behaviors with 60 months of longitudinal data from 140 USENET newsgroups, focusing on cross-posting activities as a form of reshaping behavior. Empirical results are consistent with the proposed hypotheses that reshaping behaviors within a discussion community affect member dynamics and community responsiveness in both positive and negative ways. Taken together, the findings highlight the boundary-related design challenges faced by managers seeking to support ongoing activity within online discussion communities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0378","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['community', 'dynamics', 'boundaries']","The article discusses the dynamics of online discussion communities and the implications of boundary reshaping, which touches on community behavior and inclusivity.

This paper illustrates that adopting this emerging advertising scheme has profound impacts on one fundamental function of advertising\u2014signaling product quality. We identify several important dimensions that affect the signaling function of performance-based advertising relative to its traditional counterpart (impression-based advertising). These include: (1) information\u2014total advertising expenditure is determined after the demand is realized, so it is unobservable to consumers when making purchase decisions; (2) ad performance\u2014the measured \u201cperformance\u201d (e.g., recorded click-throughs) includes actions generated by first-time buyers (i.e., advertising performance) and actions generated by repeat buyers (i.e., product performance), which increases the cost of signaling through advertising; (3) demand uncertainty\u2014the merchant pays only when a response to the advertisement is generated, which reduces the merchant's advertising uncertainty. We build a model of performance-based advertising by explicitly incorporating these factors, and we derive the conditions under which switching to performance-based advertising will (a) disable or strengthen the signaling function of advertising, (b) help or hurt the merchant, and (c) lead to a higher or lower advertising expenditure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0380","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of performance-based advertising without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we examine whether firms receive incremental benefits from IT-related spillovers and whether these spillovers lead to more persistent returns. We focus on the spillovers that accrue to firms from their interindustry transactions, especially the IT services industry. We model and estimate the impact of spillovers on long-run productivity using firm-level data from the manufacturing, transportation, trade, and services sectors. We find that spillover impacts are highly significant, but that the magnitude and persistence of the impacts vary. Firms with high IT intensity receive greater spillover benefits from the IT services industry. Moreover, these benefits are sustained over a long-term horizon. However, the impact of IT-related spillovers does not persist in low IT intensity firms regardless of the source. Overall, our results shed light on the existence and sources of IT-related spillovers and on their important role in shaping the long-run returns to IT investment. Our results also help explain the findings of excess returns to IT investment in the IT productivity literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0381","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT-related spillovers and their impact on productivity without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2012","23","3-part-2","Carol HsuCarol Hsucarolhsu@ntu.edu.twNational Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, TaiwanSearch for more papers by this author, Jae-Nam LeeJae-Nam Leeisjnlee@korea.ac.krKorea University Business School, Seoul 136-701, KoreaSearch for more papers by this author, Detmar W.

Although a number of institutional theories deal with information systems (IS) innovation in organizations, most of these institutional-centered frameworks overlook external economic efficiency and internal organizational capability in the presence of pressures of institutional conformity. Using Korea as the institutional setting, our research model posits that economic-based consideration will moderate the institutional conformity pressure on information security adoption while organization capability will influence the institutional confirmation of information security assimilation. The model is empirically tested using two-stage survey data from a field study of 140 organizations in Korea. The results indicate that in addition to institutional influences, our six proposed economic-based and organizational capability moderating variables all have significant influences on the degree of the adoption and assimilation of information security management. We conclude with implications for research in the area of organizational theory and the information security management literature, and for practices regarding how managers can factor into their information security planning the key implementation variables discovered in this study. The robust setting of the study in Korean firms allows us to generalize the theory to a new context and across cultures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0393","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['institutional conformity', 'organizational capability', 'information security']","The article primarily focuses on economic efficiency and organizational capability in relation to information security, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

An Empirical Analysis of the U.S. Manufacturing Supply Chains","The bullwhip effect is a major source of supply chain inefficiency. Whereas prior literature has identified a number of potential contributing factors and recommended such remedies as information sharing enabled by information technology (IT) or electronic linkage (EL), few studies have provided empirical support. We use industry-level data to examine whether EL use with buyer and supplier industries helps reduce the bullwhip effect as measured by inventory\u2013demand variance ratio. Our major findings are that (1) EL use with supplier industries reduces the bullwhip effect, whereas (2), surprisingly, EL use with buyer industries increases it, but (3) this adverse effect tends to be mitigated by IT use. These findings point to the possible asymmetric effects of EL use in supply chains and provide a different perspective to the existing conclusions in the literature that EL use improves performance. Combining the above results, we have learned that the use of EL tends to behave differently depending on whether it is used upstream or downstream in the supply chain. This also sheds light on the conditions under which such investment may be more (or less) beneficial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0394","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain efficiency and the bullwhip effect without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Challenging this assumption, this study seeks to identify the boundaries of the effects of trust and risk on transaction activity in the context of institutional structures in online marketplaces. The perceived effectiveness of institutional structures (PEIS), defined as the extent buyers believe that appropriate conditions are in place to facilitate transactions with sellers, sets the boundaries of trust and risk by moderating their effects on transaction activity in a quadratic (inverted-U) fashion. Specifically, at the lower boundary condition of PEIS (among buyers who believe institutional structures are ineffective), the high situational uncertainty they perceive should make these buyers unwilling to become vulnerable to sellers, thus rendering trust and risk immaterial to their decision making. Trust and risk should also be immaterial at the higher boundary condition of PEIS (among buyers who believe institutional structures are very effective), because the insufficient situational uncertainty makes trust and risk irrelevant to these buyers' decision making because of a lack of vulnerability. Only between these two boundary conditions (among buyers who perceive moderate levels of PEIS), and thus a moderate degree of situational uncertainty and vulnerability in the marketplace, should trust and risk have a significant effect on transaction activity. Data from 398 buyers on eBay's and Amazon's online marketplaces support the quadratic moderating role of PEIS on the effect of risk on transaction activity, but not on the effect of trust. Theoretical and practical implications on specifying the boundaries of the effects of trust and risk and understanding the direct and moderating role of institutional structures are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0395","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'risk', 'institutional structures']","The article discusses trust and risk in online marketplaces, focusing on institutional structures, but does not engage with themes of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Relying on modern econometric methods to reduce the selection bias of installing a spam filter, we use a unique data setting implemented at a German university to measure the costs associated with spam and the costs savings of spam filters. Our methodological framework accounts for effect heterogeneity and can be easily used to estimate the effect of other IS technologies implemented in organizations. The majority of costs stem from the time that employees spend identifying and deleting spam, amounting to an average of approximately five minutes per employee per day. Our analysis, which accounts for selection bias, finds that the installation of a spam filter reduces these costs by roughly one third. Failing to account for the selection bias would lead to a result that suggests that installing a spam filter does not reduce working time losses. However, cost savings only occur when the spam burden is high, indicating that spam filters do not necessarily reduce costs and are therefore no universal remedy. The analysis further shows that spam filters alone are a countermeasure against spam that exhibits only limited effectiveness because they only reduce costs by one third.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0396","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical and economic aspects of spam filters without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, in striving to achieve specific outcomes, firms may incur significant risks. Although many companies claim to have attained substantial benefits from their virtual world initiatives, many others have recently scaled down or even abandoned their experimental virtual world projects. This paper assesses the value proposition of virtual world initiatives from the real options perspective. Specifically, we argue that virtual worlds act as a firm's growth option, and we adopt the lens of real options to evaluate the value of this emerging and uncertain technological platform. We employ the event study method to assess the stock market's perception of the future revenue streams of 261 virtual world initiatives announced between 2006 and 2008. Our results indicate that, overall, the market reacts positively to virtual world initiatives. Our findings also show that investors' reactions to virtual world initiatives are contingent on four key characteristics of virtual world initiatives: interpretive flexibility (i.e., technologies that allow managers to experiment), divisibility (i.e., ability to incrementally implement the technology), strategic importance (i.e., an initiative that affects a process of strategic importance to the firm), and exploitable absorptive capacity (i.e., ability to exploit the knowledge acquired through the initiative).

There is an increasing belief among entrepreneurs that electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), specifically blog coverage, can aid in achieving venture capital financing. Conflicting findings reported by past studies examining eWOM make it unclear what to make of such beliefs of entrepreneurs. Even if there were generally agreed-upon results, a stream of literature indicates that because of the differences in traits between the prior investigated contexts and venture capital financing, the findings from the prior studies cannot be generalized to venture capital financing. Extant studies also fall short in examining the role of time and the status of entities generating eWOM in determining the influence of eWOM on decision making. To address this dearth of literature in a context that attracts billions of dollars every year, we investigate the effect of eWOM on venture capital financing. This study entails the challenging task of gathering data from hundreds of ventures along with other sources including VentureXpert, surveys, Google Blogsearch, Lexis-Nexis, and Archive.org. The key findings of our econometric analysis are that the impact of negative eWOM is greater than is the impact of positive eWOM and that the effect of eWOM on financing decreases with the progress through the financing stages. We also find that the eWOM of popular bloggers helps ventures in getting higher funding amounts and valuations. The empirical model used in this work accounts for inherent selection biases of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and we conduct numerous robustness checks for potential issues of endogeneity, selection bias, nonlinearities, and popularity cutoff for blogs. The findings have important implications for entrepreneurs and suggest ways by which entrepreneurs can take advantage of eWOM.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0402","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['financing', 'venture capital', 'eWOM']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of venture financing and electronic word-of-mouth without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The consumers derive benefit from consuming content but suffer from delivery delays. A publisher's content provision strategy comprises two decisions: (a) the content quality (affecting consumption benefit) and (b) the content distribution delay (affecting consumption cost). The focus here is on how a publisher should choose the content provision strategy in the presence of a content pirate such as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Our study sheds light on how a publisher could leverage a pirate's presence to increase profits, even though the pirate essentially encroaches on the demand for the publisher's content. We find that a publisher should sometimes decrease the delivery speed but increase quality in the presence of a pirate (a quality focused strategy). At other times, a distribution focused strategy is better; namely, increase delivery speed, but lower quality. In most cases, however, we show that the publisher should improve at least one dimension of content provision (quality or delay) in the presence of a pirate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0406","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical strategies for content provision in the context of piracy without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, e-government systems have been plagued by an unsatisfactory, or even a decreasing, level of trust among citizen users. The political exclusivity and longstanding bureaucracy of governmental institutions have amplified the level of difficulty in gaining citizens' acceptance of e-government systems. Through the synthesis of trust-building processes with trust relational forms, we construct a multidimensional, integrated analytical framework to guide our investigation of how e-government systems can be structured to restore trust in citizen-government relationships. Specifically, the analytical framework identifies trust-building strategies (calculative-based, prediction-based, intentionality-based, capability-based, and transference-based trust) to be enacted for restoring public trust via e-government systems. Applying the analytical framework to the case of Singapore's Electronic Tax-Filing (E-Filing) system, we advance an e-government developmental model that yields both developmental prescriptions and technological specifications for the realization of these trust-building strategies. Further, we highlight the impact of sociopolitical climates on the speed of e-government maturity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0386","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['trust', 'citizen', 'sociopolitical', 'government']","The article discusses the importance of trust in citizen-government relationships, highlighting sociopolitical factors that influence public acceptance of e-government systems.

Given that these standards are designed for interorganizational business processes, we suggest that adoption of these standards depends not only on the factors pertinent to a focal firm but also on factors that represent synergies between a focal firm and its trading partners. In this paper, building on the technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) framework and interorganizational theories, we propose a model that postulates that a set of TOE factors will have synergistic effects (i.e., interactions between a focal firm's and its partner's factors) on IBPS adoption. We tested our model in a study of 248 firms (124 dyads) in the high-tech industry implementing RosettaNet-based IBPS and found that three TOE factors (i.e., process compatibility, standards uncertainty, and technology readiness) had synergistic effects and two factors (i.e., expected benefits and relational trust) had direct effects on IBPS adoption. We also found that IBPS adoption led to greater relationship quality (i.e., partnering satisfaction) and operational efficiency (i.e., cycle time). Further, we found that IBPS adoption mediated the effect of TOE factors on partnering satisfaction and cycle time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0404","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['interorganizational', 'synergy', 'trust']","The article focuses on technical aspects of business process standards and operational efficiency without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Many firms introduce electronic channels in addition to their traditional sales channels but find that buyer usage of the e-channel over time does not keep up with initial expectations. Firms must understand the underlying factors that drive channel usage and how these factors change over time and across buyers. Using panel data pertaining to the purchase histories of 683 buyers over a 43-month period, we estimate a dynamic discrete choice model in a B2B setting that (i) recognizes how price, channel inertia, and inventory change over time; (ii) allows buyers to dynamically trade off these factors when making e-channel adoption decisions; and (iii) takes into account buyer heterogeneity. We find that channel usage is both heterogeneous and dynamic across buyers. Our findings reveal the dynamic tradeoff between channel inertia and the adverse price effect, which interact in opposing directions as the e-channel grows more popular over time: price increases resulting from more bids deter buyers, whereas channel inertia built from sampling experience helps retain repeat buyers for the new channel. Second, we find that the buyers' size and diversity influence purchase decisions, and the e-channel appears more attractive to small and/or diversified buyers. Based on our analysis, we postulate that the seller's allocation decisions of products across channels, if not aligned with buyer behavior, can alienate some buyers. Based on the parameter estimates from the buyer response model, we propose an improved channel allocation that enables firms to selectively attract more buyers to the e-channel and improve revenues. Channel acceptance increases as a result of smart allocation when firms understand and account for individual buyers' channel usage behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0410","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['diversity', 'buyer heterogeneity', 'channel usage']","The article mentions 'diversity' and 'buyer heterogeneity', indicating a recognition of different buyer profiles and their influence on purchase decisions.

The Desire for Online Self-Presentation","The sale of digital items, such as avatars and decorative objects, is becoming an important source of revenue for virtual community (VC) websites. However, some websites are unable to leverage this source of revenue, and there is a corresponding lack of understanding about what motivates people to purchase digital items in VCs. To explain the phenomenon, we develop a model based on the theory of self-presentation. The model proposes that the desire for online self-presentation is a key driver for such purchases. We also hypothesize that the social influence factors of online self-presentation norms and VC involvement as well as personal control in the form of online presentation self-efficacy are antecedents of the desire for online self-presentation. The model was validated by using survey data collected from Cyworld (N=217) and Habbo (N=197), two online social network communities that have been pioneers in the sale of digital items. This work contributes to our understanding of the purchase of digital items by extending the theory of self-presentation and adds to the broader line of research on online identity. It also lends insights into how VC providers can tap this source of revenue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0411","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['self-presentation', 'social influence', 'online identity']","The article discusses online self-presentation and social influence, which touch on identity and social dynamics, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

By consolidating demand and committing to buy from a single seller, standardization ensures product compatibility within the corporation and has a potential to induce intense price competition among sellers, but this potential is subject to whether competing products are compatible and the relative competitive advantages of the sellers. This paper studies when it is optimal for an employer to commit to exclusive purchase from a single seller to enforce standardization and sellers' incentives to invest in mutual compatibility. Our results suggest that the employer is more likely to make such a commitment when the competing products are compatible, less vertically differentiated, and/or more horizontally differentiated. We also find that the sellers agree to cooperate and invest in mutual compatibility only when the gap between their competitive advantages is moderate, but the availability of third party converters that enable partial compatibility can induce more collaboration among the sellers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0412","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT product standardization and competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Job search is a relatively novel dependent variable in studies of voluntary withdrawal behavior in general and for IT professionals in particular. From a universalistic perspective, HRM practices individually and in combination exhibit independently additive effects on job search behavior. Our study contrasts this perspective with configurational theory, hypothesizing that proposed ideal-type configurations of HRM practices have synergistic effects on job search behavior. We contribute to the IT and broader HRM literature by theoretically explicating and empirically demonstrating with IT professionals the power of configurational theory to explain the relationship between HRM practices and job search behavior. Our empirical results show that two configurations of HRM practices\u2014Human Capital Focused (HCF) and Task Focused (TF), which are high and low on all HRM practices, respectively\u2014exhibit a synergistic relationship with the job search behavior of IT professionals. HCF has lower job search behavior than would be expected based on the independently additive effects of the HRM practices, whereas TF has correspondingly higher job search behavior. Our results also show that less than perfect horizontal fit detracts from the synergy of these extreme configurations. Just as importantly, several other nonextreme configurations of HRM practices exhibit independently additive effects for the HRM practices but not synergy, suggesting that synergy is limited to extreme configurations.

That is, the value each consumer derives from the service increases with the total number of consumers that subscribe to the service. In addition, the service is valuable only to consumers who buy the product. We consider two pricing strategies: (1) bundle pricing, in which the firm charges a single price for the product and the service, and (2) separate pricing, in which the firm sets the prices of the product and the service separately, and consumers self-select whether to buy both or only the product. We show that in contrast to the common result in the bundling literature, often the monopolist chooses not to offer the bundle (he either sells the service separately or not at all) although bundling would increase both consumer surplus and social welfare. Thus, underprovision of the service can be the market outcome.

We describe a family of statistical models that addresses these needs by combining characterization of the economic environment with the ability to predict future economic conditions to make tactical (short-term) decisions, such as product pricing, and strategic (long-term) decisions, such as level of finished goods inventories. Our models characterize economic conditions, called economic regimes, in the form of recurrent statistical patterns that have clear qualitative interpretations. We show how these models can be used to predict prices, price trends, and the probability of receiving a customer order at a given price. These \u201cregime\u201d models are developed using statistical analysis of historical data and are used in real time to characterize observed market conditions and predict the evolution of market conditions over multiple time scales. We evaluate our models using a testbed derived from the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management, a supply chain environment characterized by competitive procurement, sales markets, and dynamic pricing.

In response to the knowledge-intensive and collaborative nature of IT service delivery in the contemporary business context, we advance the theoretical understanding of user satisfaction by re-conceptualizing IT service delivery as a bilateral, relational process between the IT staff and users. Based on this reconceptualization, we draw on social capital theory to examine the antecedents of user satisfaction with IT service delivery. Specifically, we posit that two major dimensions of social capital, i.e., cognitive capital and relational capital, not only positively affect user satisfaction but also strengthen the established relationship between service quality and user satisfaction. Furthermore, we propose that the effect of the other dimension of social capital\u2014structural capital\u2014on user satisfaction is fully mediated through cognitive capital and relational capital. A field study of 159 users in four financial companies provides general empirical support for our hypotheses. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0421","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['social capital', 'user satisfaction', 'relational process']","The article discusses social capital and its impact on user satisfaction, indicating a moderate focus on relational and collaborative aspects of IT service delivery.

Insights into consumer heterogeneity with respect to a given service are paramount in forecasting future subscriptions, understanding the impact of price and information dissemination on market penetration growth, and predicting the adoption path for complementary products that target the same customers as the original service. Employing a continuous-time utility model, we capture the behavior of a continuum of consumers who are differentiated by their intrinsic valuations from using the service. We study service subscription patterns under both perfect and imperfect information dissemination. In each case, we first specify the conditions under which consumer rational behavior supported by the utility model can explain a general observed adoption path, and if so, we explicitly derive the analytical closed-form expression for the consumer valuation distribution. We further explore the impact of awareness and distribution skewness on adoption. In particular, we highlight the practical forecasting importance of understanding the information dissemination process in the market as observed past adoption may be explained by several distinct awareness and heterogeneity scenarios that may lead to divergent adoption paths in the future. Moreover, we show that in the later part of the service lifecycle the subscription decision for new customers can be driven predominantly by information dissemination instead of further price markdowns. We also extend our results to time-varying consumer valuation scenarios. Furthermore, based on our framework, we advance a set of heuristic methods to be applied to discrete-time real industry data for estimation and forecasting purposes. In an empirical exercise, we apply our methodology to the Japanese mobile voice services market and provide relevant managerial insights from the analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0422","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and market dynamics in subscription-based IT services without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This debate appears in several articles that have been published on the subject as well as in the review process. In this latter arena, however, the debate has become increasingly like a script\u2014the actors (authors and reviewers) simply read their parts of the script; some avoid the underlying issues whereas others cursorily address generalizability without real consideration of those issues. As a result, despite the extent of debate, we seem no closer to a resolution. Authors who use student subjects rely on their scripted arguments to justify the use of student subjects and do not always consider whether those arguments are valid. But reviewers who oppose the use of student subjects are equally culpable. They, too, rely on scripted arguments to criticize work using student subjects, and do not always consider whether those arguments are salient to the particular study. By presenting and reviewing one version of this script in the context of theoretical discussions of generalizability, we hope to demonstrate its limitations so that we can move beyond these scripted arguments into a more meaningful discussion. To do this, we review empirical studies from the period 1990\u20132010 to examine the extent to which student subjects are being used in the field and to critically assess the discussions within the field about the use of student samples. We conclude by presenting recommendations for authors and reviewers, for determining whether the use of students is appropriate in a particular context, and for presenting and discussing work that uses student subjects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0423","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['generalizability', 'student subjects', 'critical assessment']","The article discusses the appropriateness of using student subjects in research, highlighting the need for a critical assessment of established practices.

This leads to what we call a \u201ctrust tipping point\u201d and two different worlds of trust. Above the tipping point revisit intention is constructed in one way, and below the trust tipping point it is constructed in a quite different way. This perspective results in very different recommendations for website designers as to the likely payoff from improving task-technology fit, aesthetic appeal, or trustworthiness, depending upon where their existing website stands relative to the trust tipping point. To test our hypotheses we used data from 314 student website users, and expanded a technique called piecewise regression (Neter et al. Applied Linear Statistical Models, 4th ed.) to allow us to analyze data as two different linear surfaces, joined at the tipping point. We found good support for our assertions that users operate differently above and below a trust tipping point.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0424","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['trust', 'cognitive misers', 'revisit intention']","The article primarily focuses on cognitive processes related to trust in e-commerce rather than addressing social justice or ethical concerns.

We consider a game-theoretic model in which two firms bid for sponsored advertising slots provided by a monopolistic search engine and then compete for consumers in price in the product market. Firms are asymmetrically differentiated in market preference and are given different exposure in organic listing aligned with their market appeal. We identify two aspects of a firm's sponsored bidding incentive, namely, the promotive and the preventive incentives. The presence of organic listing alters firms' sponsored bidding incentives such that the stronger firm has primarily preventive incentive, whereas the weaker has mainly promotive incentive. We show that the preventive incentive decreases and the promotive incentive increases as the difference in firms' market appeal decreases, and as a result, even the weaker firm may outbid the stronger competitor under such a co-listing setting. We further examine how the presence of organic listing affects the equilibrium outcomes by comparing it with a benchmark case in which there is only a sponsored list. We show that the differentiated exposure in the organic list gives the weaker advertiser chances to win a better sponsored position, which improves the overall information structure the search engine provides. As a result, the equilibrium social welfare, sales diversity, and consumer surplus increase. Although the presence of the free exposure from the organic list may reduce advertisers' sponsored bidding incentive per se, the overall effect benefits the search engine's growth in the long run.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0425","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['equilibrium social welfare', 'sales diversity', 'consumer surplus']","The article discusses the impact of organic listings on advertising outcomes, mentioning 'equilibrium social welfare' and 'sales diversity,' which suggest a consideration of broader societal impacts.

I suggest that future work investigate the role of discretionary opacity in facilitating informed trade as part of the cost\u2013benefit trade-off of the opacity decision maker (e.g., managers, analysts); test the relative effects of opacity on private information, liquidity, and price correction speed; and examine how institutional investors select which opaque firms to hold.Highlights\u25ba This discussion focuses on the key research design choices related to opacity and informed trading. \u25ba I review the various measures that Maffett (this issue) and others use to measure opacity. \u25ba I discuss the joint effects of opacity on private information, liquidity, and price corrections. \u25ba I relate the results to the literature on institutional investor performance and stock selection.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410112000626","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and informed trading without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

PEAD is a function of both the magnitude of an earnings surprise and its persistence. While prior research has largely investigated market reactions to the magnitude of the earnings surprise, in this study we show that the persistence of the earnings surprise is equally important. A unique feature of the anomalous PEAD returns documented here concerns the association between abnormal returns and trading frictions. Besides demonstrating that firms with lower earnings volatility have higher abnormal returns, we also find that lower earnings volatility firms have lower trading frictions. Taken together, these findings imply that higher abnormal returns are associated with lower trading frictions. We exploit this implication to empirically demonstrate that PEAD returns due to earnings volatility are not concentrated in the firms with the largest trading frictions, which is in contrast to the findings in prior anomaly studies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00425.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings volatility and trading frictions without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We find that managers\u2019 propensity to disclose an adjusted earnings metric (especially one that exceeds the GAAP earnings number) increases with the level of investor sentiment. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that, as investor sentiment increases, managers: (1) exclude higher levels of both recurring and nonrecurring expenses in calculating the pro forma earnings number and (2) emphasize the pro forma figure by placing it more prominently within the earnings press release. Additional analyses indicate that the association between investor sentiment and managers\u2019 pro forma disclosure decisions at least partly reflects opportunistic motives.

The analysis identifies a particular accrual accounting (depreciation) rule that is termed replacement cost accounting because the book value of existing capacity assets is set equal to the value that such assets would have if a competitive market were to exist for used assets. It is shown that replacement cost accounting aggregates past investment decisions of the firm without a loss of value-relevant information. The intrinsic value of the firm can then be expressed as a function of current accounting data and certain parameters of the firm\u2019s operating environment. Further, it is shown that replacement cost accounting is essentially the only accounting rule with this informational sufficiency property.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00428.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accrual accounting and equity valuation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In particular, we focus on the entry of foreign banks into India during the 1990s, which likely causes an exogenous increase in lender demand for timely loss recognition. Analyzing variation in both the timing and the location of the new foreign banks\u2019 entries, we find that foreign bank entry is associated with more timely loss recognition and this increase is positively related to a firm's subsequent debt levels. The change appears driven by a shift in firms\u2019 incentives to supply additional information to lenders and lenders seem to value this information. The increase in timely loss recognition is also concentrated among firms more dependent on external financing: private firms, smaller firms, and nongroup firms.

Using an abstract experiment and a survey of experienced financial managers, we provide evidence that managerial overconfidence may also contribute to this decision. Our experiment shows that participants engage in self-serving attribution, giving greater weight to internal than external factors as explanations for good performance. This increases confidence in improved future performance, which increases their willingness to issue forecasts. Two facets of the stable individual trait overconfidence, dispositional optimism and miscalibration, also contribute to confidence in improved future performance and willingness to issue forecasts. Consistent with these results, experienced financial manager survey participants believe other managers are likely to overestimate the extent to which they contribute to positive firm performance, and both overoptimism about firm performance and overconfidence in their ability to predict future firm performance contribute to issuance of earnings forecasts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00430.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial psychology and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Consistent with the private benefits motive, insider controlled firms with greater divergence between cash-flow rights and control rights are associated with more earnings management in these countries.

Capital covenants control agency problems by aligning debt holder\u2013shareholder interests. Performance covenants serve as trip wires that limit agency problems via the transfer of control to lenders in states where the value of their claim is at risk. Companies trade off these mechanisms. Capital covenants impose costly restrictions on the capital structure, while performance covenants require contractible accounting information to be available. Consistent with these arguments, we find that the use of performance covenants relative to capital covenants is positively associated with (1) the financial constraints of the borrower, (2) the extent to which accounting information portrays credit risk, (3) the likelihood of contract renegotiation, and (4) the presence of contractual restrictions on managerial actions. Our findings suggest that accounting-based covenants can improve contracting efficiency in two different ways.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00432.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on contract theory and financial covenants without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We use speech samples of CEOs during earnings conference calls, and generate vocal dissonance markers using automated vocal emotion analysis software. We begin by assessing construct validity for the software-generated dissonance markers by correlating them with four dissonance-from-misreporting proxies obtained in a laboratory setting. We find a positive association between these proxies and vocal dissonance markers generated by the software, suggesting the software's dissonance markers have construct validity. Applying the software to CEO speech, we find that vocal dissonance markers are positively associated with the likelihood of irregularity restatements. The diagnostic accuracy levels are 11% better than chance and of similar magnitude to models based solely on financial accounting information. Moreover, the association between vocal dissonance markers and irregularity restatements holds even after controlling for financial accounting and linguistic-based predictors.

Consistent with TCE theory, we find that in-house production efficiencies and our proxy for transaction risk (i.e., deriving from transaction infrequency, transaction complexity, and relationship-specific investments) significantly explain the extent of outsourcing of aircraft maintenance. We extend TCE insights to show that incentive delta (i.e., the sensitivity of CEO portfolio holdings to stock price changes) strengthens the negative association between production efficiencies and outsourcing while incentive vega (i.e., the sensitivity of CEO holdings to stock return volatility) weakens the negative association between transaction risk and outsourcing. Monitoring strengthens the negative association between in-house production efficiencies and outsourcing, but has no effect on the transaction risk\u2013outsourcing relation.

We identify two accounts, the compensated absence liability account and the unfunded pension liability account, which provide incumbent gubernatorial candidates with flexibility for manipulation. We find that, in an election year, the liability associated with compensated absences and unfunded pension liabilities are both systematically lower. We also find that the variation in these employment-related liabilities is correlated with proxies for the incumbent's incentives and ability to manipulate their accounting reports.

Our approach exploits the inherent property of accrual accounting that any accrual-based earnings management in one period must reverse in another period. If the researcher has priors concerning the timing of the reversal, incorporating these priors can significantly improve the power and specification of tests for earnings management. Our results indicate that tests incorporating reversals increase test power by around 40% and provide a robust solution for mitigating model misspecification arising from correlated omitted variables.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00449.x","original article","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to earnings management without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2012","50","2","DAVID F.

Determinants of the (Non-)Disclosure of Existing Material Weaknesses","We study determinants of internal control reporting decisions under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404) using a sample of restating firms whose original misstatements are linked to underlying control weaknesses. We find that only a minority of these firms acknowledge their existing control weaknesses during their misstatement periods, and that this proportion has declined over time. Further, the probability of reporting existing weaknesses is negatively associated with external capital needs, firm size, non-audit fees, and the presence of a large audit firm; it is positively associated with financial distress, auditor effort, previously reported control weaknesses and restatements, and recent auditor and management changes. These results provide evidence that detection and disclosure incentives play a role in whether existing material weaknesses are reported, which has implications for the effectiveness of SOX 404 in providing investors with advance warning of potential accounting problems.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00434.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal control reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find robust evidence that the cost of equity is increasing in government ownership. We also show that the cost of equity is significantly related to political orientation and the extent of government expropriation. Furthermore, we report a less pronounced effect of state ownership on the cost of equity in more populist governments and in more financially developed countries, in addition to a more pronounced effect of state ownership on the cost of equity when the risk of government expropriation is higher. Results from an event study examining the replacement of left-wing governments by right-wing governments suggest a lower cost of equity in more financially developed countries and a higher cost of equity in more autocratic countries and in countries with a high risk of government expropriation. Finally, we find that chief executive turnover is associated with a higher cost of equity in more autocratic countries.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00435.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['political determinants', 'government ownership', 'expropriation']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of political factors on the cost of equity, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Using Reg FD as a beginning point for these structural changes, we find that, while fund family size was positively associated with fund performance in the period prior to the regulatory changes, this advantage is significantly weaker in the period subsequent to the regulatory changes. Consistent with the weakened advantage of fund family size in fund performance, we find that the greater stock-picking skill of larger fund families, measured using the earnings announcement returns of the stocks they trade, also weakened subsequent to the regulatory changes. Using narrower event windows around the regulatory changes, we find that the previously documented superior return of large fund families was partly attributable to selective disclosure. We also find that fund families implicated in the trading scandals experienced a decline in their performance during the scandal period. Finally, we examine the role of large investment banks in providing an advantage to large fund families. Family size was positively associated with the extent to which funds traded in the same direction as forecast revisions by analysts from large investment banks in the period prior to Reg FD and the GS and this association declined significantly after the two regulatory events.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00436.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and regulatory changes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

There are, however, possible benefits to these arrangements for outside shareholders. We find that the overall volume of disclosed RPTs is generally not significantly associated with shareholder wealth as measured by operating profitability or Tobin's Q. However, the results for total RPT volume obscure that ex ante RPTs, transactions that predate a counterparty becoming a related party, are innocuous at worst in terms of their association with operating profitability and significantly positively associated with Tobin's Q whereas ex post RPTs, transactions initiated after a counterparty becomes a related party, are significantly negatively associated with operating profitability. Ex post RPTs also result in significant share price declines when first disclosed and are associated with an increased likelihood that a firm will enter financial distress or deregister its securities. These results are consistent with ex post RPTs serving as means for insiders to expropriate outside shareholders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00437.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['insiders', 'shareholders', 'self-dealing']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of related party transactions and their financial implications, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Prior research finds that equity risk incentives motivate managers to make risky investment and financing decisions, since risky activities increase stock return volatility and the value of stock option portfolios. Aggressive tax strategies involve significant uncertainty and can impose costs on both firms and managers. As a result, managers must be incentivized to engage in risky tax avoidance that is expected to generate net benefits for the firm and its shareholders. We predict that equity risk incentives motivate managers to undertake risky tax strategies. Consistent with this prediction, we find that larger equity risk incentives are associated with greater tax risk and the magnitude of this effect is economically significant. Our results are robust across four measures of tax risk, but do not vary across several proxies for strength of corporate governance. We conclude that equity risk incentives are a significant determinant of corporate tax aggressiveness.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00438.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate tax aggressiveness and equity risk incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

The relation between transparency and liquidity is more pronounced in periods of high volatility, when investor protection, disclosure requirements, and media penetration are poor, and when ownership is more concentrated, suggesting that firm-level transparency matters more when overall investor uncertainty is greater. Increased liquidity is associated with lower implied cost of capital and with higher valuation as measured by Tobin's Q.

The Internet is one channel through which public information is disseminated to investors and we propose that one way that investors express their demand for public information is via Google searches. We find that abnormal Google search increases about two weeks prior to the earnings announcement, spikes markedly at the announcement, and continues at high levels for a period after the announcement. This finding suggests that information diffusion is not instantaneous with the release of the earnings information, but rather is spread over a period surrounding the announcement. We also find that information demand is positively associated with media attention and news, and is negatively associated with investor distraction. When investors search for more information in the days just prior to the announcement, preannouncement price and volume changes reflect more of the upcoming earnings news and there is less of a price and volume response when the news is announced. This result suggests that, when investors demand more information about a firm, the information content of the earnings announcement is partially preempted.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00443.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investor behavior and information demand without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The empirical evidence indicates a weak increase in accounting-based PPS in the post-adoption period, primarily driven by countries with large differences between IFRS and their previously adopted local accounting standards. We also document a significant increase in accounting-based RPE using foreign peers after the adoption. Additional analysis shows that the increase in RPE is greater for firms with more foreign sales, and for those with lower availability of domestic peers of comparable size. The overall results are consistent with the compensation committees in those countries perceiving earnings after IFRS adoption to be of higher quality and comparability. Our paper highlights an important benefit of IFRS largely ignored by the literature, that is, the higher earnings quality and comparability brought by the adoption of IFRS facilitate executive compensation contracting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00453.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and their impact on executive compensation, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Moreover, the market\u2019s stock price and investment responses to bad news disclosures are stronger than the responses to good news disclosures, which is consistent with the empirical evidence. We also find that myopic managers are more likely to withhold bad news in good economic times when markets can independently assess expected investment returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00454.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate disclosure and investment decisions without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We further examine whether certification by high-reputation lead banks extends to the quality of borrowers\u2019 reported accounting numbers. Controlling for endogenous matching of borrowers and lead banks, we find that higher bank reputation is associated with higher profitability and credit quality in the three years subsequent to loan initiation. We also show that bank reputation is associated with long-run sustainability of earnings via higher earnings persistence, and debt contracting value of accounting via a stronger connection between pre-loan profitability and future credit quality. We further document that the enhanced earnings sustainability associated with higher reputation lead banks reflects both superior fundamentals and accruals more closely linked with future cash flows.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00455.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of bank reputation and its impact on borrower performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The Relationship Between Relative Wages and Employee Theft","In this study, we examine whether, for a sample of retail chains, high levels of employee compensation can deter employee theft, an increasingly common type of fraudulent behavior. Specifically, we examine the extent to which relative wages (i.e., employee wages relative to the wages paid to comparable employees in competing stores) affect employee theft as measured by inventory shrinkage and cash shortage. Using two store-level data sets from the convenience store industry, we find that relative wages are negatively associated with employee theft after we control for each store's employee characteristics, monitoring environment, and socio-economic environment. Moreover, we find that relatively higher wages also promote social norms such that coworkers are less (more) likely to collude to steal inventory from their company when relative wages are higher (lower). Our research contributes to an emerging literature in management control that explores the effect of efficiency wages on employee behavior and social norms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00456.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['employee theft', 'compensation', 'social norms']","The article discusses the relationship between employee wages and theft, touching on social norms and ethical behavior.

This study investigates this idea empirically using personnel and lending data from a financial services organization that implemented a highly decentralized business model. I exploit variation in this organization in whether or not employees are selected via channels that are likely to sort on the alignment of their preferences with organizational objectives. I find that employees selected through such channels are more likely to use decision-making authority in the granting and structuring of consumer loans than those who are not. Conditional on using decision-making authority, their decisions are also less risky ex post.

In this paper, we analyze the effects of increased auditor liability on the audit failure rate, the cost of capital, and the level of new investment. We focus on a setting in which, with imperfect auditing, a firm has better information than investors about its prospects and seeks to raise capital for new investments in a lemons market. The equilibrium analysis derives corporate reporting and investing choices by the firm, attestation opinions by the auditor, and valuation by rational investors. Three empirically testable predictions emerge: although increasing auditor liability decreases the audit failure rate and the cost of capital for new projects, it also decreases the level of new profitable investments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00458.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditor liability and corporate financial disclosures without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Managers are privately informed about the value of their firm and have incentives to voluntarily disclose information and manipulate their reports in order to obtain more favorable terms when issuing equity to finance a new profitable investment opportunity. The model shows that treating managers\u2019 disclosure and investment decisions both as endogenous and allowing managers to manipulate their voluntary reports yields qualitatively different predictions from when the disclosure and investment decisions are considered separately and managers cannot engage in manipulation. The model predicts that managers\u2019 disclosure strategy is sometimes characterized by two distinct nondisclosure intervals (contrary to traditional threshold equilibria of voluntary disclosure models) and that managers with intermediate news sometimes forego the new profitable investment opportunity. As such, the paper highlights the importance of considering the interdependencies between firms\u2019 disclosure and investment decisions and provides new empirical predictions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00459.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of voluntary disclosure and manipulation in financial reporting without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Using an experiment, I find that more readable disclosures lead to stronger reactions from small investors, so that changes in valuation judgments are more positive when news is good and more negative when news is bad. Drawing on research in psychology to explain this result, I predict and find that processing fluency from a more readable disclosure acts as a subconscious heuristic cue and increases investors\u2019 beliefs that they can rely on the disclosure. Although I do not find that more readable disclosures directly increase perceptions of management credibility, I do find evidence of an indirect effect operating through feelings of processing fluency.

Domestic and foreign policy makers are increasingly concerned with the effect of income shifting on dwindling tax revenues, however, extant research on income shifting by U.S. multinational enterprises is mixed. We address the disconnect between the academic literature and the policy maker's perceptions by examining the extent of multijurisdictional income shifting by U.S. multinational companies. We directly address conflicting results in extant literature and show that using either multiperiod proxies or instrumental variables overcomes weaknesses of annual proxies in this setting. Our tests show that U.S. companies have become more active at shifting income out of the United States as the regulatory costs of shifting have changed. Holding tax rate differences between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions constant, our empirical estimates suggest that our sample of 380 corporations with low average foreign tax rates collectively shifts approximately $10 billion of additional income out of the United States annually during 2005\u20132009 relative to 1998\u20132002 due to varying regulatory costs of shifting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00463.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['income shifting', 'tax revenues', 'regulatory costs']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of income shifting by multinational corporations and its impact on tax revenues, with no significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

Much of this increased U.S. investment is purchased in the foreign market, implying that the cross-listing effect reflects something more fundamental about a firm than easier acquisition of its securities.

Survey and experimental results indicate that the more self-relevant a consumer-brand relationship, the more likely are anti-brand retaliatory behaviors after the relationship ends. These anti-brand behaviors are diverse: from complaining to third parties, to negative word of mouth, to illegal actions such as theft, threats, and vandalism. In contrast, post-exit consumer-brand relationships that were low in self-relevance but were high in trust, commitment, and satisfaction are less likely to result in anti-brand actions. The role of a discrete product or service failure is also explored, and results suggest that self-relevance may motivate retaliation even in the absence of a so-called critical incident.

The pain of paying in cash can curb impulsive urges to purchase such unhealthy food products. Credit card payments, in contrast, are relatively painless and weaken impulse control. Consequently, consumers are more likely to buy unhealthy food products when they pay by credit card than when they pay in cash. Results from four studies support these hypotheses. Analysis of actual shopping behavior of 1,000 households over a period of 6 months revealed that shopping baskets have a larger proportion of food items rated as impulsive and unhealthy when shoppers use credit or debit cards to pay for the purchases (study 1). Follow-up experiments (studies 2\u20134) show that the vice-regulation effect of cash payments is mediated by pain of payment and moderated by chronic sensitivity to pain of payment.

However, greater equality also increases the position gains derived from status-enhancing consumption, since it allows low-tier consumers to get ahead of the higher proportion of consumers clustered in the middle tiers. As a result, greater equality reduces consumption when consumers focus on the narrower possession gap, but it increases consumption when they focus on the greater position gains (i.e., when consumption is conspicuous, social competition goals are primed, and the environment is competitive).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/1/27/1799810","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['equality', 'consumption', 'status', 'social competition']","The article discusses the impact of equality on consumption behaviors, particularly among lower-tier consumers, which touches on themes of social equity and competition.

The present studies examine three potential explanations: mere associations, market demands, and contagion (the belief that these objects contain some remnants of their previous owners). Results indicate that while market demands do play a role, contagion appears to be the critical factor affecting the valuation of celebrity possessions. Manipulating the degree of physical contact that a celebrity has with an object dramatically influences consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase it, and individual differences in sensitivity to contagion moderate this effect.

When these features are appealing, increased elaboration increases preference for preference-inconsistent alternatives. When these features are unappealing, increased elaboration may reduce preference for preference-inconsistent alternatives.

Testifying to its practical importance, expressing the energy content of snacks in kilojoules rather than kilocalories increases the choice of a healthy snack. The unit effect occurs because consumers focus on the number rather than the type of units in which information is expressed (numerosity effect). Therefore, reminding consumers of alternative units in which information can be expressed eliminates the unit effect.

Females discriminate relational information among competing advertisements and use this information to identify incongruent products that would otherwise go unidentified. Consequently, they evaluate the products more favorably. Consistent with predictions of a limited capacity in working memory, we find this performance for females coincides with a reduction in ad claim recognition. Close inspection reveals the trade-off between product identification and ad recognition is the result of involuntary resource allocation from verbal processing to visuo-spatial processing. Hence, females may be able to use the advertising context to identify an extremely incongruent product, but this performance is not without a cost.

In three studies, we show that consumers predict spending more time on a pleasant event when it is unpacked into several subactivities and spending less time on an unpleasant event when it is unpacked. We also investigate the underlying mechanism and demonstrate that (1) people have a lay belief that they spend more (less) time on more (less) pleasant events and (2) unpacking increases the intensity of predicted consumption experience.

This identity-dependent processing produces different recognition outcomes for information that is strongly related, moderately related, and unrelated to the identity. Identity activation at both encoding and retrieval improved recognition of advertising content moderately related to the identity but had no effect on recognition of unrelated content.

However, the dark side to sporting events is the incidence of traffic fatalities due to game-related drinking. Here, we ask whether the closeness of the game affects the number of fatalities that occur. Two opposing predictions can be made. Games that are not close (\u201cblowouts\u201d) may be less engaging, thus increasing drinking. Alternatively, close games may be more dangerous, increasing competition-associated testosterone that spills over into aggressive driving. An analysis of major sporting events (2001\u20138) shows that closer games are significantly correlated with more fatalities. Importantly, increased fatalities are observed only in locations with winning fans (game site and/or winners\u2019 hometown), congruent with a testosterone-based account. Ultimately, this finding has material consequences for public welfare on game days and suggests that one silver lining for losing fans may be a safer drive home.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/4/611/1856774","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['public welfare', 'fatalities', 'aggressive driving']","The article discusses the societal impact of sporting events on public welfare, particularly in relation to traffic fatalities.

However, if they are reminded that they set their own low goals, and that these goals were met, they are as satisfied as better performers. Experiment 2 shows that incremental theorists who believe that they can improve their performance in the future tend to compare their performance to the initially set goal rather than the highest potential performance, and are hence as satisfied as better performers.

The analysis of interview and blog narratives of consumers attempting to lose weight reveals how they adopt practices imbued with magical thinking in the form of creative persuasion, retribution, and efficient causality.

These conduits provide opportunities for sensegiving, which features normative elements particular to an organization, and sensemaking, an integrative process in which productive consumption plays a key role. Three paths (epiphany, emulation, and exploration) leading from these conduits to identification are defined and explored. Second, this article reveals dynamic consequences of identification for both customer and employee constituents, including changes in their consumer values and behaviors extending beyond organizational concerns. Finally, this article defends the merit of softening hard conceptual distinctions drawn between consumers and employees, as the findings show that identification forms in parallel fashion with similar outcomes across a consumer-to-firm and an employee-to-firm context.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/4/650/1858021","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identification', 'normative', 'values', 'consumer behavior']","The article discusses the identification of constituents with organizations, emphasizing normative elements and consumer values, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social identity and ethical considerations in consumer behavior.

Across five studies, we show that highlighting incentive value\u2014for instance, by message framing or by measuring chronic focus or by manipulating situational focus on incentive value\u2014enhances preference toward outcomes associated with noninstrumental effort. We discuss the importance of our findings for understanding everyday consumption decisions and argue for a widespread tendency among individuals wanting the best to infer value from noninstrumental effort.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/4/712/1859335","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['effort', 'consumer preference', 'value']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We found that diners consumed more from smaller rather than larger forks.

As a consequence, this literature remains theoretically mute on questions related to the sociological disparities that arise when marketplace performances forge relationships between affluent consumers and underclass service workers: a circumstance becoming increasingly commonplace owing to trends in the service-oriented global economy. To redress this gap, we analyze how such sociocultural differences are manifested and mediated in the provisions of skilled marketplace performances. Building upon Bourdieu\u2019s logic of field analysis, our resulting theoretical framework illuminates a network of structural relations that reconfigures the asymmetrical distribution of class-based resources between these class factions. Rather than being cooperative endeavors conducive to the formation of commercial friendships, we show that these class-stratified marketplace performances produce interdependent status games, subtly manifested power struggles, and contested forms of symbolic capital.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/5/796/1796164","articles","JCR","Marketing","7","['sociological disparities', 'class-based resources', 'status games', 'power struggles']","The article addresses sociological disparities and class stratification in marketplace interactions, indicating a focus on social justice themes.

If only one of these conditions holds, there is no alignment in consumption, and a negative comparison does not occur. Importantly, we also show that the identity of the social referent is critical to these effects.

A series of three experiments demonstrate that a phased choice process can shift attribute preferences. If the top choice is unavailable, consumers with weak attribute preferences are likely to reject their explicitly identified second choice (the runner-up option). Instead, these consumers choose an option that may not meet the initial screening criteria but that does share a desirable, \u201cdifferentiating\u201d feature with the unavailable top choice. Judgment data indicate that this preference reversal is due to increased salience of the differentiating attribute during the last phase of the original choice, which \u201ccarries over\u201d into the subsequent choice.

Evidence from five experiments demonstrates this preference-enhancing effect of the delayed presentation of favorable information, and it illustrates the underlying preference dynamics across decision stages associated with such a delay.

Five experiments provide converging evidence that semantic activation is the primary underlying process for the effect.

The effect is fully mediated by semantic activation of related weight concepts. Moreover, processing the concept of importance does not necessarily influence the physical experience of carrying weight. An affective state such as mental stress (psychological load), however, does have a reciprocal effect on the physical experience of carrying weight, indicating that there might be different pathways between weight experience and its metaphorically linked concepts.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/38/6/1063/1791432","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the psychological mechanisms of semantic activation related to physical experiences without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider three existing theories about multiple ratings: information production, rating shopping, and regulatory certification. Using differences in rating composition, default prediction, and credit spread changes, our evidence only supports regulatory certification. Marginal, additional credit ratings are more likely to occur because of, and seem to matter primarily for, regulatory purposes. They do not seem to provide significant additional information related to credit quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01709.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of credit rating agencies and their regulatory roles without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity and inclusion."],["2012","67","1","BENJAMIN E.

Consequently, a point can exist beyond which additional disclosure decreases firm value. Holding all else equal, we further show that larger firms will adopt stricter disclosure rules than smaller firms and firms with better disclosure will employ more able management. We show that mandated increases in disclosure could, in part, explain recent increases in both CEO compensation and CEO turnover rates.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01710.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['disclosure', 'agency problems', 'executive compensation']","The article primarily focuses on corporate governance and financial implications of disclosure without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Contrary to prior studies, top-tier advisors deliver higher bidder returns than their non-top-tier counterparts but in public acquisitions only, where the advisor reputational exposure and required skills set are relatively larger. This translates into a $65.83 million shareholder gain for an average bidder. The improvement comes from top-tier advisors' ability to identify more synergistic combinations and to get a larger share of synergies to accrue to bidders. Consistent with the premium price\u2013premium quality equilibrium, top-tier advisors charge premium fees in these transactions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01712.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial performance of investment bankers in mergers and acquisitions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Supplementary testing indicates that family control characteristics intensify informed short selling. Further analysis suggests that daily short-sale interest in family firms contains useful information in forecasting stock returns; however, we find no discernable effect for nonfamily firms.

The latter effect originates from firms' debt rollover. When liquidity deterioration causes a firm to suffer losses in rolling over its maturing debt, equity holders bear the losses while maturing debt holders are paid in full. This conflict leads the firm to default at a higher fundamental threshold. Our model demonstrates an intricate interaction between the liquidity premium and default premium and highlights the role of short-term debt in exacerbating rollover risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01721.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on debt market liquidity and credit risk, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast, we find that stocks are substantially more volatile over long horizons from an investor's perspective. This perspective recognizes that parameters are uncertain, even with two centuries of data, and that observable predictors imperfectly deliver the conditional expected return. Mean reversion contributes strongly to reducing long-horizon variance but is more than offset by various uncertainties faced by the investor. The same uncertainties reduce desired stock allocations of long-horizon investors contemplating target-date funds.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01722.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock volatility and investor behavior without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Around earnings announcements, however, IR firms cannot spin the news and their clients' returns are significantly lower.

Daily high (low) prices are almost always buy (sell) trades. Hence, the high\u2013low ratio reflects both the stock's variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of the high\u2013low ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not. This allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of high\u2013low ratios over 1-day and 2-day intervals.

Specifically, we use differences between the attributes of stock issuers and repurchasers to forecast characteristic-related factor returns. For example, we show that large firms underperform after years when issuing firms are large relative to repurchasing firms. While our strongest results are for portfolios based on book-to-market (i.e., HML), size (i.e., SMB), and industry, our approach is also useful for forecasting factor returns associated with distress, payout policy, and profitability.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01730.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock issuance and forecasting returns based on financial characteristics, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2012","67","3","ERWAN MORELLEC,\u00a0\n                     ERWAN MORELLECSearch for more papers by this authorBORIS NIKOLOV,\u00a0\n                     BORIS NIKOLOVSearch for more papers by this authorNORMAN SCH\u00dcRHOFF,\u00a0\n                     NORMAN SCH\u00dcRHOFF\n                     Erwan Morellec is with Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Swiss Finance Institute, and CEPR.

Rauh's result stems from heavily underfunded firms that constitute a small fraction of the sample and that differ sharply from the rest of the sample.

We document that 74% of this magnitude is attributable to two outliers of 865 sample firms. In addition, we find that the compensation committee independence requirement increases CEO total pay, particularly in the presence of effective shareholder monitoring. Our evidence casts doubt on the effectiveness of independent directors in constraining CEO pay as suggested by the managerial power hypothesis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01744.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of CEO compensation and board structure without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To take collaborators with her, she needs to have substantial ownership, and thus financing. But it is hard to raise finance against differentiated assets. So an entrepreneur has to commit to undertake a second transformation, standardization, that will make the human capital in the firm, including her own, replaceable, so that outside financiers obtain control rights that will allow them to be repaid. A vibrant stock market helps the entrepreneur commit to these two transformations. The nature of firms and financing are intimately linked.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01745.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance and entrepreneurship without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Stock prices should fall at the announcement of a policy change, on average. The price decline should be large if uncertainty about government policy is large, and also if the policy change is preceded by a short or shallow economic downturn.

These adjustments are difficult to explain by likely determinants, but exhibit a clear pattern: CDOs with smaller model-implied AAA sizes receive larger adjustments. CDOs with larger adjustments experience more severe subsequent downgrading. Additionally, prior to April 2007, 91.2% of AAA-rated CDOs only comply with the credit rating agency's own AA default rate standard. Accounting for adjustments and the criterion deviation indicates that on average AAA tranches were structured to BBB support levels.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01748.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical analysis of credit ratings without addressing social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

A firm's stock return volatility can be higher for reasons that contribute positively (good volatility) or negatively (bad volatility) to shareholder wealth and economic growth. We find that the volatility of U.S. firms is higher mostly because of good volatility. Specifically, stock volatility is higher in the United States because it increases with investor protection, stock market development, new patents, and firm-level investment in R&D. Each of these factors is related to better growth opportunities for firms and better ability to take advantage of these opportunities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01749.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on stock volatility and its implications for shareholder wealth and economic growth without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations."],["2012","67","4","MOZAFFAR KHAN,\u00a0\n                     MOZAFFAR KHANSearch for more papers by this authorLEONID KOGAN,\u00a0\n                     LEONID KOGANSearch for more papers by this authorGEORGE SERAFEIM,\u00a0\n                     GEORGE SERAFEIM\n                     Khan is at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

Banks write tighter contracts than their peers after suffering payment defaults to their own loan portfolios, even when defaulting borrowers are in different industries and geographic regions from the current borrower. The effects persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although bank equity compression is also associated with tighter contracts.

We find the major reason for this response is the alleviation of borrowing firms\u2019 financial constraints. We also find that new loan announcements are associated with a positive stock price effect even when prior loans made to the same borrower already trade on the secondary market. We conclude that the special role of banks has changed due to their ability to create an active secondary loan market while simultaneously maintaining their traditional role as information producers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01769.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of secondary market trading in loans without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

In our model, expertise improves firms\u2019 ability to estimate value when trading a security. Expertise creates asymmetric information, which, under normal circumstances, works to the advantage of the expert as it deters opportunistic bargaining by counterparties. This advantage is neutralized in equilibrium, however, by offsetting investments by competitors.

Managers smooth payout to smooth their flow of rents. Total payout (dividends plus net repurchases) follows Lintner's (1956) target adjustment model. Payout smooths out transitory shocks to current income and adjusts gradually to changes in permanent income. Smoothing is accomplished by borrowing or lending. Payout is not cut back to finance capital investment.

We analyze the market reaction to governance proposals that pass or fail by a small margin of votes in annual meetings. This provides a clean causal estimate that deals with the endogeneity of internal governance rules. We find that passing a proposal leads to significant positive abnormal returns. Adopting one governance proposal increases shareholder value by 2.8%. The market reaction is larger in firms with more antitakeover provisions, higher institutional ownership, and stronger investor activism for proposals sponsored by institutions.

Equity beta and return volatility are lower in countries where the bankruptcy code favors debt renegotiations and for firms with more shareholder bargaining power relative to debt holders. These relations weaken as the country's insolvency procedure favors liquidations over renegotiations. In the limit, when debt contracts cannot be renegotiated, equity risk is independent of shareholders' incentives to default strategically. We argue that these findings support the hypothesis that the threat of strategic default can reduce the firm's equity risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01781.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt renegotiation and equity risk without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If yes, why? In this paper, we show that a bank's stock return performance during the 1998 crisis predicts its stock return performance and probability of failure during the recent financial crisis. This effect is economically large. Our findings are consistent with persistence in a bank's risk culture and/or aspects of its business model that make its performance sensitive to crises. Banks that relied more on short-term funding, had more leverage, and grew more are more likely to be banks that performed poorly in both crises.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2012.01783.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on bank performance and risk culture during financial crises without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In the cross-section, firms owned by private equity funds average 40% smaller fleets than observably similar public firms. Similar fleet reductions are observed within firms that undergo leveraged buyouts. Quantile regressions indicate that these results are driven by firms in the upper 30% of the conditional jet distribution.

Using a hand-collected database of lawsuits, we document that more reputable VCs (i.e., VCs that are older, have more deals and funds under management, and syndicate with larger networks of VCs) are less likely to be litigated.

Or banks can innovate and make new loans on which limited historical data are available, leading to possible disagreement over default probabilities. In equilibrium, banks make zero profits on standard loans and positive profits on innovative loans, which engenders innovation incentives for banks. But innovation brings with it the risk that investors could disagree with the bank that the loan is worthy of continued funding and hence could withdraw funding at an interim stage, precipitating a financial crisis. The degree of innovation in the financial system is determined by this trade-off.

Using a battery of performance tests, we find that loans securitized before 2005 performed no worse than comparable unsecuritized loans originated by the same bank. Even loans originated by the bank that acts as the CLO underwriter do not show under-performance relative to the rest of the CLO portfolio.

We draw upon recent advances in the entrepreneurship literature to propose that the relationship between start-up rates and innovation is not uniformly positive, as expected by the early scholars of entrepreneurship, but instead depends on the country's stage of development. The relationship is positive in the developed countries, but negative in countries in early development stages. On balance, there is a weak negative association between start-up rates and innovation. We test our hypotheses on a multi-source dataset that covers 35 countries over the period from 1996 to 2002. The relationships are robust to the choice of three moderators and two dependent variables, as well as a number of post-hoc tests.

The predictability of returns opens the question whether investors should continue to diversify across international markets. Such predictability also has implications for the corporate decision of where and when to raise capital. This paper re-examines the international evidence for long-term contrarian profits using a longer time horizon than all previous studies (81 years of data from 1925 to 2005), and finds that the long-term contrarian anomaly disappears when time-varying (conditional) alphas are considered. This is true even without transaction costs. For the marginal trader, conservative transaction costs subsume LTR profits, whether returns are risk-adjusted or not. This suggests that benefits from actual trades on LTRs do not negate a strategy based on diversification. Although time-varying beta has been extensively documented as ineffective in describing LTRs, this paper demonstrates that it is important to control for time variation in alpha. A full conditional capital asset-pricing model captures the LTR premium. This suggests that macroeconomic factors are important for understanding LTRs and their associated risk.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2011.41","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial markets and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques.

On the basis of a dataset of 52 cross-border HQ relocations in Europe during 1996\u20132006, we document an increasing trend toward relocation, push and pull factors affecting HQ location choice, and catalyzing factors that affect the relocation decision. High taxes and a high employment rate represent push factors that we find to increase the likelihood of HQ relocation. In particular, at the mean rate of corporate tax, a one percentage point increase in tax translates into a 6.8% increase in HQ relocation likelihood. In contrast, central location and low taxes represent pull factors that increase the attractiveness of the HQ location. In terms of catalyzing factors, we find that export-oriented companies and regional HQ have a higher tendency to relocate. As a whole, we extend the existing research by putting forward a conceptual framework of HQ relocation decisions, and by providing novel empirical evidence on the HQ relocation phenomenon.

In brief, the results suggest that sub-national factors, such as the structure of the subsidiary network, offer a strong explanation for headquarters resource allocation. Positive and negative effects of national factors were also found, which implies that distance matters for headquarters resource allocation activities.

The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms.

Drawing on internalization theory and the literatures on upgrading and catch-up processes, learning and relational networks, we hypothesize that, for continued performance, domestic supplier firms need to adapt their strategies from catching up initially through technology licensing/collaborations and joint ventures with multinational enterprises (MNEs) to also developing strong customer relationships with downstream firms (especially MNEs). Further, we propose that successful catch-up through these two strategies lays the foundation for a strategy of knowledge creation during the integration of domestic industry with the global value chain.

We trace this variance to differences in the level of development of the formal and informal institutions protecting investors against managerial overcompensation and underperformance. In terms of intentionally devised and enforced formal institutions, we find significant positive moderating effects on the focal relationship of the rule of law and strength of investor protection variables. For self-enforcing informal institutions, we find similar effects for concentrated ownership and compensation-related entries in codes of good corporate governance. We also find that formal and informal institutions function in a complementary manner in shaping the performance sensitivity of executive compensation. The focal relationship becomes stronger when concentrated owners have access to well-functioning courts, and when informal norms of good governance are supported by shareholder protection laws.

We applied the information-processing lens in global BPO and developed the logic that internationally disaggregated process integration requires a fit between process integration and BPO's task characteristics (i.e., task complexity and security) and task interdependence (task connectivity, stickiness, and dependency). This alignment is further moderated by the task context, such as the geographic dispersion of the global client's end-customers and the type of offshore provider (independent vendor vs captive and joint venture). Finally, we suggest that process integration has a positive but curvilinear relationship with the economic returns achieved by offshore providers.

The paper argues that variability in the performative aspects of internationalization routines is associated with improvisational learning and new capability development, whereas variability in the ostensive aspects is associated with trial-and-error learning and existing capability improvement. Furthermore, psychic distance moderates these relationships. Low psychic distance facilitates both improvisation and trial-and-error learning; high psychic distance frustrates learning of both types. Moderate psychic distance makes the success of both learning forms more likely \u2013 but only for more experienced INVs. The paper also argues that social capital may mitigate the negative effects of high psychic distance. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a micro-level explanation of how INVs accomplish capability learning and avoid wasteful learning efforts, and by theorizing the moderating effects of psychic distance on the relationships between routine microprocesses and capability learning.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2012.13","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['capability learning', 'social capital', 'internationalization']","The article primarily focuses on organizational routines and capability learning without significant emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

We tested our hypotheses in a sample of middle managers who were working in multinational teams. The results of this study show that leaders of multinational teams are more likely to profit from the local know-how of employees from underrepresented nationalities when they are open to their ideas, and when they have the same nationality. The study also shows that the effects of being open to employees\u2019 ideas and sharing the same nationality are mediated by affective commitment and psychological safety, respectively. We discuss how, even though the current relational demography perspective with its dichotomous understanding of (dis)similarity is not suited to capture the dynamics of cultural differences, it does set the stage for future studies to examine the cultural dynamics behind an individual's experience of being different from other team members in multinational teams.

In this paper, we examine the effect of more stringent securities regulation on the supply and performance of VC, as well as on new business creation (i.e., entrepreneurial spawning). Using country-level and investment-level data from 34 countries over the years 2000\u20132008, we find that more stringent securities regulation is positively associated with the supply and performance of VC around the world. More stringent securities regulation is also positively associated with entrepreneurial spawning induced by VC. Among different forms of securities regulation, disclosure stands out as having the most economically meaningful impact, which casts doubt on the oft-repeated objections to disclosure in VC \u2013 that it would stifle the VC industry, because secrets would have to be revealed to competitors and the public. These findings are robust to numerous robustness checks for endogeneity.

Rather than merely viewing internationalization as the result of differences in resource positions, we demonstrate that an important source of variation is the idiosyncratic manner in which EMEs are affiliated with government agencies. Although government involvement has a strong effect on international expansion, this effect is contingent upon the level at which the firm is affiliated with government and the degree of state ownership. Different types and levels of governments have different objectives, exert different institutional pressures on EMEs, and impact their willingness and ability to internationalize differently. Government involvement influences the level of overseas investment, its location (developed vs developing countries) and its type (resource- vs market-seeking). These effects depend on firms\u2019 own resources and capabilities, suggesting that not all firms possess equal ability to internalize government-related advantages and respond to institutional pressures. By demonstrating that resource-based and institutional constructs are highly dependent on one another, we enhance understanding of how EMEs succeed in expanding overseas, and why governments matter.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2012.18","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['government involvement', 'internationalization', 'emerging-market enterprises']","The article discusses the role of government in internationalization, which touches on institutional pressures but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Low government efficiency delays investment in unknown technologies by increasing contracting hazards, environmental uncertainty and the difficulty of allocating potential returns; thus requiring greater experience on the part of firms when undertaking investment decisions. Furthermore, government inefficiency accentuates the relative significance of firm-specific drivers of technology adoption, but reverses the positive effect of industry competition in promoting technology adoption. I empirically investigate this phenomenon through hazard models analyzing the factors that affect the timing of the adoption of electronic ticketing by close to 180 airlines operating in 110 different countries. The results imply that government inefficiency in certain countries not only leads to slower technology penetration rates compared with their counterparts, but also exacerbates the technology gaps within countries by providing unwarranted advantages to firms that are already well entrenched.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2012.20","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['government efficiency', 'technology adoption', 'investment decisions']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of government efficiency and its impact on technology adoption in airlines, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We posit that foreign firms are also intrinsically more volatile and footloose than domestic ones, and that this leads to an increasing divergence between the exit rates of foreign and domestic firms. Empirically, we find that the difference between exit rates of foreign firms and domestic firms increases with age, as exit of foreign firms increases with age while that of purely domestic firms decreases. Exit rates of domestic-based multinationals do not change significantly with age; they are between those of foreign and purely domestic firms, but are closer to the latter.

We suggest that where legal institutions are weak, detailed contracts are ineffective in containing partner opportunism in contractually specified areas. Under such circumstances, relational governance provides a proxy for legal institutions to ensure contract execution. Meanwhile, relational governance serves as an alternative mechanism to centralized control for ensuring contingency adaptations. Based on a sample of 168 foreign buyer\u2013local supplier exchanges in China, we find that relational governance complements detailed contracts but substitutes for centralized control in curtailing opportunism.

In the competition for talent, organizations must understand employee preferences and expectations regarding their treatment by the firm. Recently, culture's influence on the psychological contract (individual perceptions of employer obligations) has been noted with regard to the extent that employees perceive their psychological contracts as relational or transactional. We provide results from a survey conducted in a multinational corporation (MNC) indicating that the cultural value of collectivist orientation likely has its effect on the psychological contract through beliefs about the nature of social exchange. Data were consistent with creditor exchange ideology (appropriateness of giving more than has been received) mediating the relationship between collectivist orientation and perceptions of a relational psychological contract. By examining this relationship empirically, we go beyond the demonstration of cultural effects to describe an intermediate mechanism through which culture operates.

Building upon organizational evolution and learning literature, we propose that differences in entry timing among sister subsidiaries provide structural conditions that bound the opportunities for inter-subsidiary learning. We argue that different entry cohorts of sister subsidiaries are beneficial to a focal subsidiary, as they provide non-redundant, complementary experience from their different operational stages, and ignite the motivation to learn. Our empirical analysis of Japanese foreign subsidiaries provides strong evidence that survival is enhanced by the experience of different entry cohorts of sister subsidiaries, but not by that of similar cohorts. Qualitative evidence also shows that multiple channels of experience exchange across sister subsidiaries lead to actual learning. We further show that the survival benefit derived from different cohorts is contingent on the level of environmental change, as well as on the level of experience of the focal subsidiary and its parent firm.

Conversely, greater abnormal returns arise for sellers with inferior channel relationships and for those selling multiple brands, brands with relatively lower price/quality positioning than the seller's remaining portfolio, and brands unrelated to the rest of the seller's portfolio.

To address this issue, they examine a unique data set that combines a broad set of seven marketing-mix instruments with private-label share, using two decades' worth of data for 106 consumer packaged goods categories in the United States. The results show that private-label share behaves countercyclically and that part of the boost in private-label share during contractions is permanent. Retailers' observed practice of supporting their own labels in contraction periods while cutting back in expansion periods helps this cyclical sensitivity even further. In addition, national brands' procyclical behavior in terms of (1) major new product introductions, (2) advertising, and (3) their promotional pressure compared with private labels is associated with more pronounced cyclical fluctuations in private-label share and even with permanent private-label market share gains.

This theory proposes that people are motivated to construe the world as a just place where people get what they deserve. In the current research, when people are confronted with high levels of injustice (communicated need is high) and avenues for justice restoration seem uncertain or unavailable, assisting others by supporting fair trade decreases. However, highlighting how injustice can be redressed through purchases enhances fair-trade support under conditions of high need. The effects are moderated by justice sensitivity factors, such as just-world beliefs and whether the product type (indulgence vs. necessity) makes the injustice of consumer privilege salient.

Three studies show that manipulating the serving size, and thus calories per serving, for equivalent consumption amounts influences the anticipated guilt of consumption, purchase intentions, and choice behavior. However, the results also show that individual difference and context variables, which heighten consumer attention to nutritional information in general, often focus attention on calorie information but not serving size.

The results confirm regulatory depletion: High-stress employees feel more fatigue and perform more poorly than low-stress employees in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, the depletion effect from work stress is largely attenuated on employees' performance on tasks requiring less or limited self-regulation. The mediated moderation tests further show that the extent of the depletion effect is not uniform. Employees who can replenish their resources from supervisory support or enhance their goal focus by engaging in perspective taking are less affected by regulatory depletion.

The Case\n                        of Media Critics and Professional Movie Reviews","Third-party product reviews (TPRs) have become ubiquitous in many industries. Aided by communication technologies, particularly on the Internet, TPRs are widely available to consumers, managers, and investors. The authors examine whether and how TPRs of new products influence the financial value of firms introducing the products. An event study covering 14 major media and professional reviews of movies released by 21 studios shows that TPRs exert significant impact on stock returns in the direction of their valence. However, the impact comes from the valence of a review that is measured relative to other, previously published reviews and not from the absolute valence of the review itself. The authors further study the dynamics of TPR impact on firm value and find that the impact exists only for prerelease reviews and is the strongest on the product release date, though it disappears when sales information becomes available after product release. These results demonstrate that TPRs play significant roles as the investors update their expectation about new product sales potential. The authors also find that advertising spending increases the positive impact of TPRs on firm value and buffer the negative impact. Therefore, firms could strategically use marketing instruments such as advertising to moderate the impact of TPRs.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.09.0034","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the financial impact of third-party product reviews on firm value, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If the product development team wants to reduce resistance to products with market newness, it needs to build a coalition of supporters that can help it during the review process. Similarly, if the team seeks to minimize resistance to products with technology newness, it should frame the product in terms of the firms\u2019 existing products, strategies, and competitive thrusts. However, such framing increases resistance to market newness. If products continue to be resisted, they must be compromised (i.e., modified as a concession) to win approval.

Then, they use structural equations modeling on survey data to explore how these elements can be modeled as both first-order and higher-order structural models. A higher-order model yields seven core elements: self\u2013brand integration, passion-driven behaviors, positive emotional connection, long-term relationship, positive overall attitude valence, attitude certainty and confidence (strength), and anticipated separation distress. In addition to these seven core elements of brand love itself, the prototype includes quality beliefs as an antecedent of brand love and brand loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance to negative information as outcomes.

Sweethearting occurs when frontline workers give unauthorized free or discounted goods and services to customer conspirators. The authors gather dyadic data from 171 service employees and 610 of their customers. The results from the employee data reveal that a variety of job, social, and remuneration factors motivate sweethearting behavior and several measurable employee traits suppress its frequency. The results from the customer data indicate that although sweethearting inflates a firm's satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word-of-mouth scores by as much as 9%, satisfaction with the confederate employee fully mediates these effects. Thus, any benefits for customer satisfaction or loyalty initiatives are tied to a frontline worker that the firm would rather not employ. Marketing managers can use this study to recognize job applicants or company settings that are particularly prone to sweethearting and as the basis for mitigating a positive bias in key customer metrics.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.09.0420","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['illicit behavior', 'employee traits', 'customer satisfaction']","The article discusses unethical behavior (sweethearting) in a business context, highlighting employee motivations and customer impacts.

The authors build on this work by suggesting that people low in appearance self-esteem (ASE) are particularly sensitive to external control properties (i.e., packaging-related factors that signal the ability of packaging to regulate food intake) and, as a result, increase consumption levels when packages are small (vs. large or absent). Factors that highlight the external control properties of small packages, such as the visibility of product quantity, location of the caloric content, and communicated caloric content, further increase consumption, particularly among people with low ASE. The underlying process appears to be, at least in part, cognitively driven. The effects are mitigated when participants are under cognitive load, and the findings are mediated by cognitions regarding the ability of small packages to regulate food intake. The results have important practical implications suggesting that to quell the effects of small packages on overconsumption, emphasis on the external control properties of small packages should be minimized.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.09.0512","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['appearance self-esteem', 'external control', 'consumption']","The article touches on the concept of appearance self-esteem and its impact on consumption behavior, which hints at social and psychological factors influencing consumer choices.

However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor\u2013automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.10.0441","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['automation', 'service quality', 'productivity']","The article primarily focuses on optimizing service productivity through automation and profit maximization, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The first study, a manager study, is based on an executive survey of a sample of more than 100 downsizing projects. The other two studies are customer studies that use an experimental scenario method. Across the two methods, results show that the extent of downsizing is linked to customer uncertainty. In addition, both survey results and experimental results reveal that open downsizing communication carries substantial risks for downsizing firms. Although open communication reduces customer uncertainty if customers have strong informal ties with the firm's employees or perceive a firm's products as important, it may increase customer uncertainty in other situations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.09.0486","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['communication', 'downsizing', 'customer uncertainty']","The article discusses the implications of downsizing on customer reactions and emphasizes the importance of open communication, which touches on ethical organizational practices.

They hypothesize and find that BAV brand equity is significantly associated with the components of CLV in expected and meaningful ways. For example, customer knowledge of a brand has an especially strong positive relationship with all three components of CLV. Notably, however, differentiation is a double-edged sword. While it is associated with higher customer profitability, it is also associated with lower acquisition and retention rates.

Research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. This study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. The authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. They examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. The model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. This study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.11.0130","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['diversity', 'innovation', 'collaboration']","The article discusses 'resource diversity' and its role in 'firm innovation,' which suggests an awareness of the benefits of diverse partnerships.

When consumers must dispose of products to which they feel emotionally attached, they often expect to sell the product at a price in excess of its market value. However, the authors identify a condition in which product attachment can decrease rather than increase the minimum price sellers are willing to accept. Specifically, they propose that due to concern for how products are used following a transaction, strongly attached sellers may be more willing than weakly attached sellers to provide discounts to potential buyers whose usage intentions are deemed appropriate. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on one particular consequence of attachment, namely, the intensified reluctance of consumers to part with their possessions, this research identifies a novel consequence of attachment: a heightened sensitivity to the manner in which the product will be used following a transaction. Four empirical studies provide converging evidence that sellers\u2019 product attachment determines the extent to which their minimum acceptable sales price is influenced by buyer usage intent.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.11.0181","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['emotional attachment', 'usage intentions', 'sensitivity']","The article touches on the emotional aspects of consumer behavior and how sellers' concerns about the future use of their products can influence pricing.

The authors offer rational inattention as an explanation and document patterns of downward rigidity in online prices of computers and cameras that are consistent with this view. Their basic argument is that under certain circumstances, it is rational for consumers to ignore small price changes. This results in some price rigidity because firms would see no demand effect for small reductions. The authors suggest that this inattention systematically varies across different types of multicomponent systems, leading to specific hypotheses about sellers\u2019 pricing behavior.

Other consumers\u2019 online ratings weaken the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience but can either exacerbate or overturn the negative effect of product failure, depending on the quality of product recovery. For marketing theory, the findings indicate that consumers who influence others are themselves influenced by other consumers and that this influence is contingent on their product experience. For managerial practice, the authors offer a method to estimate the effects of product experience characteristics on online product ratings and show that social influence effects make high online product ratings a double-edged sword, exacerbating the negative effect of product failure and strengthening the benefit of product recovery.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.10.0377","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['social influence', 'consumer', 'product ratings']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of consumer behavior and product ratings without addressing any significant social justice or ethical themes.

The authors compare the normative assumptions about customers that underlie equity-based return shipping policies with the more realistic, positivist expectations as predicted by attribution, equity, and regret theories. Two longitudinal field studies over four years using two surveys and actual customer spending data indicate that retailer confidence in those normative assumptions is unjustified. Contrary to retailer assumptions, neither the positive consequences of free returns nor the negative consequences of fee returns were reversed when customer perceptions of fairness were taken into account. Depending on the locus and extent of blame, customers who paid for their own return decreased their postreturn spending at that retailer 75%\u2013100% by the end of two years. In contrast, returns that were free to the consumer resulted in postreturn customer spending that was 158%\u2013457% of prereturn spending.

The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value.

Second, is there a mediation effect of advertising and R&D spending on the relationship between long- versus short-term compensation and stock market return? The authors address these questions using a combination of ExecuComp, Compustat, and Center for Research in Security Prices data on 842 firms during the 1993\u20132005 period. They find that an increase in the equity to bonus compensation ratio is positively associated with an increase in advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales. Advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales also mediates the effect of equity to bonus ratio on stock market return.

The authors find a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the vertical delegation of pricing authority and profitability as well as a positive relationship between the horizontal dispersion of pricing authority across sales, marketing, and finance and profitability. Another key finding is a positive interaction between vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion, indicating that firms need to jointly design vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion.

This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client\u2013financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants\u2019 satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.11.0205","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['participation', 'self-efficacy', 'other-efficacy', 'enjoyment', 'satisfaction']","The article discusses the concepts of self-efficacy and other-efficacy in the context of service participation, indicating a focus on the relational and emotional aspects of customer and employee experiences.

As a result, consumers increasingly encounter products with brand names that imply a COO that differs from the actual COO (where the product is manufactured). In four experiments, the authors find support for the hypothesis that incongruence between the actual COO and implied COO decreases purchase likelihood asymmetrically. Incongruence backfires in hedonic categories but has hardly any effect in utilitarian categories. Furthermore, incongruence decreases purchase likelihood more if the actual COO is an emerging rather than developed country. The authors address the psychological process underlying the asymmetric effect of incongruence by showing that consumers apply different information-processing strategies to hedonic versus utilitarian products.

The main objective is to examine its impact on various aspects of consumer purchase behavior and a retailer's sales revenue. They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new LP had a significantly different impact on \u201ccurrent\u201d LP members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers.

Standard economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level, customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the contract\u2014for example, due to \u201chassle costs.\u201d If customers use period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract. They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic discounting.

Four studies demonstrate that salient cues in advertising or packaging (e.g., pictures, brand names) can increase perceived product efficacy and lead to a lower usage amount on a single occasion. The authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's need for cognition.

They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a second-order differential equation for the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman (HJB) equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures).

When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet relies on subscription fees only for revenues.

The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences.

The second set of studies investigates how divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a). The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b).

Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors.

The data contain information on supplier interactions with retail stores, including Wal-Mart, for a period of five years.

Their results show that wholesale prices are not the main driver of postentry supplier profit changes; market expansion is. They observe a significant increase in shipments to 50% of markets studied.

The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured).

For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not imposed a price restraint.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.10.0508","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to budgeting and spending without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As a result, category similarity affects extension evaluations when the extension is family branded but not when it is subbranded.

The current study collects neuroimaging data while participants are exposed to advertisements with differing levels of perceived message deceptiveness (believable, moderately deceptive, and highly deceptive). The functional magnetic resonance imaging data, combined with an additional behavioral study, offer evidence of two noteworthy results.

They decompose the deterministic component of product utility into two parts: that accounted for by observed attributes and that due to nonobserved attributes. The authors estimate the unobserved component by relating it to the corresponding residuals of virtual experts representing homogeneous groups of people who experienced the product earlier and evaluated it. Their methodology involves identifying such virtual experts and determining the relative importance they should be given in the estimation of the target person's residuals. Using Bayesian estimation methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation inference, the authors apply their approach to two types of consumer preference data: (1) online consumer ratings (stated preferences) data for Internet recommendation services and (2) offline consumer viewership (revealed preferences) data for movies.

Although a firm's profits might be expected to decrease when a competitor expands its product line because the firm loses some sales to the new product, this intuition is incomplete because a competitor's product line expansion can also soften price competition. The author first provides an example using the Hotelling model that demonstrates the possibility and mechanism of profit-increasing competitor entry. He then presents conditions under which a competitor's product line expansion increases profits under the mixed-logit model. The study demonstrates that firms benefit from a rival's entry most when a moderate number of customers are unserved before the new-product introduction and when the new product is positioned such that both the rivals' products appeal to similar sets of customers. With regard to extensions, this study demonstrates that the result continues to hold when firms choose product attributes endogenously and that a manufacturer's profits can increase from a rival's product line expansion even when the firms sell through a retailer.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.10.0164","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on profit maximization through product line expansion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this article, the author assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers. Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage benefits.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.10.0183","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on product innovation and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When advertisements are served in higher positions, approximately one-third of new conversions is due to increased click-through while approximately two-thirds are due to increased conversion rates.

Researchers have typically explained the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by which people select items from among those available. This precludes the possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets themselves\u2014that is, how people decide which options to consider when making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in multiple- versus single- item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose simultaneously choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent) choice set. These findings cannot be attributed to alternative patterns of covariation, including latent error correlations; to temporal stochastic inflation; or to unobserved heterogeneity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.10.0437","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of choice set formation and diversification without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They further apply the model to examine a canonical example, the theater-then-video sequential distribution of motion pictures, and estimate the parameters using Kalman filtering/smoothing and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The results show that advertising and WOM exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving demand.

The results from a study of 828 salespeople in 204 branches of a large distributor of industrial goods provide evidence that perceived outcome risk containment and outcome reward emphasis enhance primary appraisals, whereas perceived process risk containment and process reward emphasis enhance secondary appraisals. In turn, the authors find that salespeople's primary and secondary appraisals influence their change implementation behaviors, leading to successful change implementation. Notably, they also find that (outcome and process) risk containment has a greater influence on appraisals of salespeople with a higher performance orientation, but the effects of (outcome and process) reward emphases are invariant across salespeople's performance orientation.

This research focuses on mating mind-sets (i.e., thinking about a mate), which consumers commonly experience. Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the external situation can influence brand extension evaluations, particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions. These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set). Furthermore, using prestige brands (vs. functional brands) reduces the gap between men and women. In addition, subbrand architecture (vs. direct brand architecture) boosts the evaluations of female consumers but decreases those of male consumers.

The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation of promotional expenditures across brands.

Recently, websites have begun to offer social networks and user-generated links alongside the product network, creating a dual-network structure. The authors investigate the role of this dual-network structure in facilitating content exploration. They analyze YouTube's dual network and show that user pages have unique structural properties and act as content brokers. Next, the authors show that random rewiring of the product network cannot replicate this brokering effect. They present seven Internet studies in which participants browsing a YouTube-based website are exposed to different conditions of recommendations. The first set of studies shows that exposure to the dual network results in a more efficient (time to desirable outcome) and more effective (average product rating, overall satisfaction) exploration process.

Specifically, the authors compare the generation of WOM (i.e., consumers sharing information about their own experiences) with the transmission of WOM (i.e., consumers passing on information about experiences they heard occurred to others). They suggest that a basic human motive to self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive WOM (i.e., share information about their own positive consumption experiences) but transmit negative WOM (i.e., pass on information they heard about others' negative consumption experiences).

A company's transactional database can only be built from customers' transactions with that company. Any transactions that have been made with other companies are missing.

They use transactions conducted with a single supplier in that category to infer consumers' behavior with other suppliers in that category. In particular, armed with prior knowledge of the parametric form of consumer interpurchase time distributions, they uncover elements of the stochastic process that dictates which supplier a consumer chooses on a particular purchase occasion. The authors focus on interpurchase times because they form the core of the incomplete information problem. If a company uses its observed interpurchase times to estimate interpurchase times in the category for a specific consumer, its estimate will be biased upward. Combined with the model developed in this study, a familiar analysis of transaction profitability can be used to build a new type of lifetime value: lifetime category value of the customer.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.06.0005","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to marketing analytics and consumer behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In other words, they show that two status products that are (imperfect) substitutes in the consumer utility function may be complements in the profit function.

Given that consumers commonly believe price and quality are positively correlated and that price\u2013quality perceptions have been shown to influence price evaluations and willingness to pay, the generalizability of existing research to commonly encountered contexts is questionable. In this research, the authors examine the influence of price order on consumer choice across differing brands in contexts in which consumer quality perceptions are free to covary with price and they are manipulated to be correlated or uncorrelated with price. Using reference dependence theory as a framework, they find that when differing brand options are presented in descending price order, consumers tend to choose higher-price options; when they are presented in ascending price order, consumers tend to choose lower-priced options (the price order effect).

Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint.

They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly \u201coveruse\u201d in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage.

The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0009","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Not only is BEA distinct from two conceptualizations of fit in brand extension literature\u2014fit as similarity and fit as relevance\u2014but it also moderates the effects of both fit dimensions on brand extension responses. By capturing a cultural and consumer relational perspective that shapes reactions to brand extensions, BEA provides an important, complementary construct for predicting brand extension success and enhancing brand value.

Because intermediate effects\u2014cognition, affect, and experience\u2014are unobservable constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models explain how advertising grows sales but ignore the role of intermediate effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments the dynamic advertising\u2013sales response model by integrating the hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic advertising\u2013sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating hierarchy (advertising \u2192 experience \u2192 cognition \u2192 affect \u2194 sales). The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales growth and brand building.

They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing. Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing increases in detailing activities.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0114","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of drug diffusion and physician behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This article demonstrates that attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare, and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more broadly.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0142","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['consumer welfare', 'public policy', 'attributes']","The article primarily focuses on consumer choice and marketing strategies without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

To this purpose, we present a separation procedure for MIP problems\u2014SEP-MIPMK\u2014where we derive knapsack sets of the form XMK by aggregating the continuous variables in the mixed knapsack inequalities of the formulation. Then, we use SEP-MK to generate cutting planes. Before the continuous variables are aggregated, the mixed knapsack inequalities are modified through the use of a bound substitution procedure to take into account fixed and variable bounds on the continuous variables. Bound substitution is made according to some heuristic rules, so even if its basic component SEP-MK is \u201cexact,\u201d the overall separation procedure for MIP problems, SEP-MIPMK, is heuristic. We perform a computational study on a wide set of mixed-integer programming instances from the MIPLIB 2003 [Achterberg, T., T. Koch, A. Martin. 2006. Mixed Integer Problem Library (MIPLIB) 2003.

The process models describe the ordering relationships between tasks in a process in terms of standard constructs like sequence, parallel, choice, and loop. Most algorithms assume that each trace in a log represents a correct execution sequence based on a model. In practice, logs are often noisy, and algorithms designed for correct logs are not able to handle noisy logs. In this paper we share our key insights from a study of noise in process logs both real and synthetic. We found that all process logs can be explained by a block-structured model with two special self-loop and optional structures, making it trivial to build a fully accurate process model for any given log, even one with inaccurate data or noise present in it. However, such a model suffers from low quality. By controlling the use of self-loop and optional structures of tasks and blocks of tasks, we can balance the quality and accuracy trade-off to derive high-quality process models that explain a given percentage of traces in the log. Finally, new quality metrics and a novel quality-based algorithm for model extraction from noisy logs are described. The results of the experiments with the algorithm on real and synthetic data are reported and analyzed at length.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0444","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of process mining and algorithm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, for at least a certain class of problems, we show that the acceptance probability within C-NORTA decays only linearly with respect to a defined rarity parameter.

To this end, we extend earlier optimization models to incorporate both objectives and develop an exact branch-and-price approach to solve this problem, generalizing a solution approach studied for the case where only efficiency is taken into account. In addition, we propose an effective solution algorithm that approximates the (generally nonconcave) frontier of Pareto-efficient solutions with respect to the two objectives by simultaneously generating and successively improving upper and lower bounds on this frontier. We implement and test our approach on observed data and show that solutions significantly dominating the current configuration in both efficiency and equity can be found.

Phylogenies find applications in several scientific areas ranging from medical research, to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to systematics, and to population dynamics. In such applications, the available information is usually restricted to the leaves of a phylogeny and is represented by molecular data extracted from the analyzed species, such as DNA, RNA, amino acid, or codon fragments. On the contrary, the information about the phylogeny itself is generally missing and is determined by solving an optimization problem, called the phylogeny estimation problem (PEP), whose versions depend on the criterion used to select a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. In this paper, we investigate a recent version of the PEP, called the balanced minimum evolution problem (BMEP).

In the last few years, it has been a favorite playground for metaheuristics, but very few contributions have appeared on exact methods. In this paper we introduce an exact approach based on the optimal solution of subproblems limited to a subset of variables. Each subproblem is faced through a recursive variable-fixing process that continues until the number of variables decreases below a given threshold (restricted core problem). The solution space of the restricted core problem is split into subspaces, each containing solutions of a given cardinality. Each subspace is then explored with a branch-and-bound algorithm. Pruning conditions are introduced to improve the efficiency of the branch-and-bound routine. In all the tested instances, the proposed method was shown to be, on average, more efficient than the recent branch-and-bound method proposed by Vimont et al. [Vimont, Y., S. Boussier, M. Vasquez. 2008. Reduced costs propagation in an efficient implicit enumeration for the 0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem. J. Combin. Optim.15(2) 165\u2013178] and CPLEX 10.

This framework enables the modeling of internal security threats that emanate from cross-task and cross-personnel assignments and the development of optimal staffing strategies that meet security requirements at minimum operational costs. Our detailed implementation analysis reveals that the model developed is not demanding in terms of required parameters and that the proposed approach is practical and adaptable to evolving business, regulatory, and workforce conditions.

The aim of the MEBP is to determine the power assignment of each node in a wireless sensor network such that a specified source node can broadcast messages to each of the other nodes and the total energy consumption is minimized. We first present a new formulation involving an exponential number of constraints for the broadcasting requirement. We then prove that under a mild condition, these constraints for the broadcasting requirement are facet defining.

Applications of this problem include testing rationality of collective consumption behavior, a subject in microeconomics. We prove that the problem is NP-complete even for oriented graphs and argue that the existence of a constant-factor approximation algorithm is unlikely for an optimization version that maximizes the number of vertices that can be colored using two colors while avoiding monochromatic cycles. We present three exact algorithms\u2014namely, an integer-programming algorithm based on cycle identification, a backtracking algorithm, and a branch-and-check algorithm. We compare these three algorithms both on real-life instances and on randomly generated graphs. We find that for the latter set of graphs, every algorithm solves instances of considerable size within a few seconds; however, the CPU time of the integer-programming algorithm increases with the number of vertices in the graph more clearly than the CPU time of the two other procedures. For real-life instances, the integer-programming algorithm solves the largest instance in about a half hour, whereas the branch-and-check algorithm takes approximately 10 minutes and the backtracking algorithm less than 5 minutes. Finally, for every algorithm, we also study empirically the transition from a high to a low probability of a YES answer as a function of the number of arcs divided by the number of vertices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0466","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in graph theory and algorithm development without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

These execution locations differ in speed, communication characteristics, and size. In particular, hardware components offering high speed tend to accommodate only few code segments. The goal of software partitioning is to find an assignment of code segments to execution locations that minimizes the overall program run time and respects the size constraints. In this paper we demonstrate that an additional speedup is obtained if we allow code segments to be instantiated on more than one location. We further show that the program run time not only depends on the execution frequency of the code segments but also on their execution order if there are multiply instantiated code segments. Unlike frequency information, however, sequence information is not available at the time when the software partition is selected. This motivates us to formulate the software-partitioning problem as a robust optimization problem with decision-dependent uncertainty. We transform this problem to a mixed-integer linear program of moderate size and report on promising numerical results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0467","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software partitioning and optimization, with no mention of social themes, diversity, ethics, or any socially progressive topics.

Much is known about the asymptotic behavior of such procedures. In this paper, we introduce coverage contours to quantify the trade-offs in interval coverage, stopping times, and precision for finite-sample experiments using absolute precision rules. We use these contours to evaluate the coverage of a basic absolute precision stopping rule, and we show that this rule will lead to a bias in coverage even if all of the assumptions supporting the procedure are true. We define optimal stopping rules that deliver nominal coverage with the smallest expected number of observations. Contrary to previous asymptotic results that suggest decreasing the precision of the rule to approach nominal coverage in the limit, we find that it is optimal to increase the confidence coefficient used in the stopping rule, thus obtaining nominal coverage in a finite-sample experiment. If the simulation data are independent and identically normally distributed, we can calculate coverage contours analytically and find a stopping rule that is insensitive to the variance of the data while delivering at least nominal coverage for any precision value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0471","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical methods related to stopping rules in experiments, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Like the Internet or the telephone network, the ability to efficiently search large social networks will play an important role in the extent of their use by individuals and organizations alike. However, unlike these domains, search on social networks is likely to involve measures that require a set of individuals to collectively satisfy some skill requirement or be tightly related to each other via some underlying social property of interest. The aim of this paper is to highlight\u2014and demonstrate via specific examples\u2014the need for algorithmic results for some fundamental set-based notions on which search in social networks is expected to be prevalent. To this end, we argue that the concepts of an influential set and a central set that highlight, respectively, the specific role and the specific location of a set are likely to be useful in practice. We formulate two specific search problems: the elite group problem (EGP) and the portal problem (PP), that represent these two concepts and provide a variety of algorithmic results. We first demonstrate the relevance of EGP and PP across a variety of social networks reported in the literature. For simple networks (e.g., structured trees and bipartite graphs, cycles, paths), we show that an optimal solution to both EGP and PP is easy to obtain. Next, we show that EGP is polynomially solvable on a general graph, whereas PP is strongly NP-hard. Motivated by practical considerations, we also discuss (i) a size-constrained variant of EGP together with its penalty-based relaxation and (ii) the solution of PP on balanced and full d-trees and general trees.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0473","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of searching and optimizing social networks without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Traditionally, minimizing beam-on time has been postponed until the leaf sequencing stage, where the treatment plan quality is already determined and fixed. However, there is a trade-off between the beam-on time and the treatment plan quality. The aim of this study is to incorporate the beam-on time into the treatment plan optimization stage using a direct aperture optimization approach that allows for explicitly quantifying the trade-off. The proposed approach can provide clinicians with valuable information for each patient case so that they can design clinically attractive yet efficient treatment plans. Using the special structure of the problem, we propose an exact solution approach that sequentially characterizes segments of the Pareto-efficient frontier. In addition, an approximate solution technique that is applicable to more classes of evaluation criteria is developed. Our approximate technique is tested on clinical cancer cases, and its performance is compared with the general approximation techniques that are available for convex bicriteria optimization problems. The results of our experiments validate that our approach can achieve a more accurate representation of the Pareto-efficient frontier with less computational effort.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0474","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of treatment plan optimization in radiation therapy without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity and inclusion."],["2012","24","4","Xue BaiXue Baixue.bai@business.uconn.eduDepartment of Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269Search for more papers by this author","A Mathematical Framework for Data Quality Management in Enterprise Systems","This paper addresses the issue of data quality management in information systems within an enterprise.

It is applied to a routing problem called the multilabel traveling salesman problem, a variant of the traveling salesman problem in which labels are attributed to the edges. The goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle that minimizes the tour length and the number of labels in the tour.

For a maximum-period MRG, a large-order k not only means a large period length (i.e., pk \u2212 1) but, more importantly, also guarantees the equidistribution property in high dimensions (i.e., up to k dimensions), a desirable feature for a good random-number generator. As to generating efficiency, in addition to the multipliers, some special choices of the prime modulus p can significantly speed up the generation of pseudo-random numbers by replacing the expensive modulo operation with efficient logical operations. To construct efficient maximum-period MRGs of a large order, we consider the prime modulus p = 231 \u2212 1 and, via extensive computer search, find two large values of k, 7,499 and 20,897, for which pk \u2212 1 can be completely factorized. The successful search is achieved with the help of some results in number theory as well as some modern factorization methods. A general class of MRGs is introduced, which includes several existing classes of efficient generators. With the factorization results, we are able to identify via computer search within this class many portable and efficient maximum-period MRGs of order 7,499 or 20,897 with prime modulus 231 \u2212 1 and multipliers of powers-of-two decomposition.

More specifically, it seeks the minimum-length tour visiting a subset of the nodes in N such that each node i not on the tour is within a predetermined distance di of a node on the tour. In this paper, we define and develop a generalized version of the CSP, and we refer to it as the generalized covering salesman problem (GCSP). Here, each node i needs to be covered at least ki times, and there is a cost associated with visiting each node. We seek a minimum-cost tour such that each node i is covered at least ki times by the tour. We define three variants of the GCSP. In the first case, each node can be visited by the tour at most once. In the second case, visiting a node i more than once is possible, but an overnight stay is not allowed (i.e., to revisit a node i, the tour has to visit another node before it can return to i). Finally, in the third case, the tour can visit each node more than once consecutively. In this paper, we develop two local search heuristics to find high-quality solutions to the three GCSP variants. To test the proposed algorithms, we generated data sets based on traveling salesman problem library instances. Because the CSP and the generalized traveling salesman problem are special cases of the GCSP, we tested our heuristics on both of those problems as well. Overall, the results show that our proposed heuristics find high-quality solutions very rapidly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0480","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in operations research without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

The data comes from a survey of 238 manufacturing plants in three industries across eight countries. Regression analyses show that both internal fit with the organizational structure and external fit with the environment affect performance.

However, some individual journals have large rank changes using different impact factor specifications. We also find that OM journal rankings based on impact factors are only moderately correlated with journal quality rankings previously determined using other methods, and the agreement among these other methods in ranking the quality of OM journals is relatively modest.

Further, we examine whether availability of organizational slack over the study interval interferes with the relationship between quality practices and process performance. Organizational slack consists of the available and accessible resources in an organization; we focus here on unabsorbed slack in the form of financial resources. We investigate the quality practices of U.S. general acute care hospitals, measured by their depth of implementation of practices characterizing a total quality management system, and use them to predict process performance related to four medical conditions. Analysis reveals differing effects that are dependent on hospital slack conditions. In hospitals with high slack, quality practices significantly predict three of four studied process performance measures. In contrast, in hospitals with low slack, quality practices predict only one of the four process performance measures, while other factors outweigh the effects of quality practices. This study lends support to management taking a long-term perspective related to implementation of quality management systems, and highlights the relevance of slack conditions in garnering the benefits of such systems.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.05.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['quality management', 'process performance', 'organizational slack']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and quality management in hospitals without addressing social justice or equity themes.

Indeed, economic theory regarding the factors which influence the outsourcing decision, treats opportunism as a core behavioral assumption. It is assumed that if given the opportunity, outsourcing providers will act in a self-serving manner despite the potentially negative impact it may have on their customer. Other researchers have suggested that opportunism is not an unwavering human behavior, but rather can be substantively influenced by the management practices which define the relationship. Building on these arguments, this study investigates the validity of these divergent positions. Hierarchical linear regression is used to examine dyadic data on 102 information technology, logistics, and other business process outsourcing relationships. We test a model which hypothesizes that the buying firm's reliance on different bases of inter-firm power will have differing effects on the risk of opportunism (shirking and poaching). These hypotheses are evaluated while concurrently examining the influence of exchange hazards (relationship-specific investments and technological uncertainty) on provider shirking and poaching. The results offer strong evidence that buyer reliance on mediated forms of power (i.e. rewards, coercive, legal legitimate) enhance the risk of both provider shirking and poaching, while non-mediated power (i.e. expert, referent) is associated with a diminished level of opportunistic behavior. Interestingly, relationship-specific investments have a significant effect on some forms of opportunistic behavior but not on other forms of opportunistic behavior. Technological uncertainty did not have a significant impact on provider opportunism.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.06.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['opportunism', 'management practices', 'power']","The article primarily focuses on economic theory and opportunism in outsourcing relationships, with no significant emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

In this research, a Schumpeterian economics perspective is adopted to investigate competitive interactions among leader and challenger firms in the domain of EM, with a particular focus on operational EM activities. Using econometric methods, the empirical analysis of panel data from a broad cross-section of US manufacturing firms reveals that such rivalry does exist and that the effect of a rival's past EM activity on a focal firm's EM activity is greater for more profitable and smaller firms.

Research shows that ambidextrous organizations can better manage these dual demands, but our understanding of the antecedents that lead to ambidexterity is still emerging. In addition, previous research has taken a piecemeal approach to understand ambidexterity and does not fully consider its multilevel nature. This research takes a multilevel perspective and argues that a competency in ambidexterity involves three capabilities at different organizational levels: decision risk (strategic level), structural differentiation (project level), and contextual alignment (meso level). After correcting for endogeneity we empirically examine the relationship between these antecedents and ambidexterity competency by collecting multi-level data from 34 high tech business units and 110 exploration and exploitation R&D projects. The results indicate that decision risk and contextual alignment affect ambidexterity competency for high tech organizations. Structural differentiation does not affect ambidexterity competency but has mixed effects on R&D project performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.10.002","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['ambidexterity', 'competency', 'decision risk']","The article focuses primarily on operational capabilities and performance metrics within high-tech organizations, with minimal reference to social themes or ethical considerations.

Given this state, the lackluster performance of an alarmingly high proportion of outsourcing initiatives is somewhat surprising. In an effort to achieve aggressive cost savings objectives, many outsourcing engagements are associated with organizational resources being disposed of which can lead to a significant operational capability loss on the part of the outsourcing firm. Surprisingly little empirical research has dealt with the issues arising from this capability loss frequently associated with outsourcing. This study strives to address this void. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, this study investigates the direct impact that capability loss has on outsourcing performance, and also the impact it has on the outsourcing firm's ability to effectively manage its relationship with the outsourcing provider. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis on 198 outsourcing initiatives suggest an inadequate capability evaluation up front can lead to a more substantive capability loss. Subsequently, we find that a more extensive capability loss has a direct negative effect on outsourcing performance. Prior studies have established the significant positive effect that developing a committed and cooperative relationship with the provider has on outsourcing performance. Our results corroborate these previous findings, and also demonstrate that capability loss inhibits the outsourcing firm's efforts to develop a committed and cooperative relationship with the outsourcing provider.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.10.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on operational capabilities and performance related to outsourcing without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The mixed findings could be due to differences across firms in terms of the capabilities to acquire, assimilate, and transform knowledge and to simultaneously pursue both the exploitation of existing operational capabilities and the exploration for new operational capabilities. Building on the literature that suggests that manufacturing flexibility mediates the relationship between environmental uncertainty and firm performance, we explore the applicability of two organizational learning contingencies to the operations environment: operational absorptive capability and operational ambidexterity. Absorptive capacity enables the recognition and assimilation of new knowledge. Ambidexterity determines whether this knowledge will be applied for both exploration and exploitation. Using a sample of 852 manufacturing firms, we find that environmental uncertainty affects firm performance directly and indirectly through manufacturing flexibility. Furthermore, both operational absorptive capacity and operational ambidexterity moderate the relationship between environmental uncertainty and manufacturing flexibility and the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and firm performance.

This would broaden the domain covered by each research effort, minimize the bias resulting from the choice of research paradigm and research domain, to enhance external validity, and to minimize the gap between our research efforts and the real world our community seeks to reshape. Second, there is an opportunity to pursue multiple perspectives because a scientific conclusion valid for a narrow domain may prove to be partially true or even false if one obtains multiple perspectives.

Interestingly, significant contributions in the academic literature offer consistent evidence that the use of mediated power has a negative impact on the quality of inter-organizational relationships. Yet, there is a dearth of empirical research investigating the conditions under which the use of mediated power is more or less prevalent. Utilizing dyadic data collected on 102 outsourcing relationships, this study evaluates how the buying firm's dependence on the service provider, asserted importance of the outsourced activity, and difficulties with other inter-organizational control mechanisms are related to their reliance on mediated power. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis support the hypotheses that the use of mediated power is diminished when the buyer is currently more dependent on the service provider due to switching difficulties and the buyer has a higher expectation of future supply market consolidation. Similar hypotheses regarding the effect of the strategic importance of the outsourced activity and entry barriers to the service provider's market were not supported.

It proposes a model that integrates multiple considerations germane to global supply chains. Postponement is important in this context because it is necessary to consider international transfers and tariffs, and it is important to appropriately account for the impact of postponement on total costs. Consideration of several key variables such as shipping point, customs tariff, and cost differences between countries is essential to derive full benefits from postponement strategy in global supply chains. International transfer of goods among countries in global automobile industry is complex and dynamic because of the multitude of factors that must be considered. The paper develops insights regarding postponement strategy in global supply chains via a system dynamics simulation model. The model draws on the experiences of a Korean automobile manufacturer with operations in developing and developed countries.\n            \n            The results of the system dynamics simulations show that the choice of optimal shipping point and the right level of postponement under the \u201cdecoupling points\u201d strategy in global operations has a significant effect on overall cost efficiency, when decoupling point and postponement timing are considered simultaneously. The results also show that there are key differences in executing the postponement strategy when shipping to a developing country as opposed to a developed country.\n            \n            This insight has practical implications for global operations and is helpful in developing a sophisticated framework for executing the postponement strategy as manufacturing firms expand their operations globally.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.01.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['global supply chain', 'developing countries', 'cost efficiency']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost efficiency, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, recent studies suggest that the operational challenges associated with meeting this objective may be heavily dependent not only upon a firm's internal modification, mix, and new product flexibilities, but also upon the flexibility of its inbound and outbound supply chain partners. Drawing upon the theory of Complementarity, we examine if simultaneous utilization of both internal and external flexibilities does in fact create synergies that can improve a firm's delivery performance. Based on a sample of 158 U.S. manufacturing plants, we find that the extent to which performance enhancing synergies are generated is primarily dependent upon the type of internal flexibility that is paired with supply chain flexibilities. Additionally, we find that when synergies do exist, external supplier and logistics flexibilities generally tend to enhance the scope of flexible response, while internal flexibilities generally tend to enhance the achievability of a flexible response. Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of firms to actually reap the synergistic benefits of an integrated system of supply chain flexibility is much more complex and nuanced than previously believed or expected.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.01.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['flexibility', 'supply chain', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on operational capabilities and performance metrics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We empirically test a conceptual framework of safety culture that accounts for the use of general quality practices as well as outcome-specific approaches in light of the general and more focused climates in which those practices are embedded. We utilize structural equation modeling to analyze a unique pairing of primary data from a survey of quality improvement directors and chief nursing officers at 272 hospitals across the U.S. with secondary data on process of care performance publicly reported by the federal government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). General safety climate and quality practices are found to establish an environment in which outcome-specific efforts enable process quality improvement. A split-group SEM analysis highlights significant differences in managing healthcare safety outcomes through climate and practices. In particular, the employment of practices focused on the specific outcome goals is found to relate to higher quality of patient care in smaller hospitals. In contrast, the development of a climate focused on specific outcome goals is found to relate to higher quality of patient care in larger hospitals. These findings suggest alternative approaches for small and large hospitals in the critical effort to improve patient safety and reduce healthcare costs.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.12.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['quality improvement', 'patient care', 'safety culture']","The article discusses quality improvement in healthcare and emphasizes patient care and safety culture, which are relevant to ethical practices in operations management.

More recently, demand management has emerged as a new dimension at the customer interface. Although it has become increasing popular in industry, it has not yet been analyzed in depth with respect to its impact on supply chain performance. Both distribution management and demand management entail customer-facing processes and practices and that are interrelated and (may) jointly determine supply chain performance. In this paper we seek to extend the stream of research in supply chain management by systematically investigating the impact of customer-facing supply chain practices on supply chain performance. Specifically, the paper examines the relative impact of relevant practices associated with demand and distribution management. To this end, we collected data from 116 multi-national companies based in Europe and analyzed it using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results suggest that (i) high demand management performance has a substantial positive impact on the overall supply chain performance, (ii) this effect is stronger than that of distribution management performance, and (iii) there is no evidence that demand management might be an enabler for effective distribution management. Among the individual practices that constitute demand and distribution management, adherence to the demand and distribution management processes and demand segmentation emerged as the strongest performance levers. Based upon additional in-depth interviews conducted with selected companies from our sample, we shed light on some of the most important findings that emerged from our survey analysis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.02.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['customer-facing', 'supply chain', 'management']","The article focuses on traditional supply chain management practices without any explicit mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The application of informal control to improve supplier performance has been well established, but the effect of formal control appears profoundly equivocal. This study proposes that the actual effect of formal control depends on its mode (output vs. behavior) and its relationship with the service type (mass vs. professional) and informal control. With survey data from 252 service buying organizations, the results indicate that output control interacts with service type to determine perceived supplier performance (PSP). Buyers\u2019 reliance on high output control has a positive effect on PSP in mass service exchanges; this effect becomes negative in professional service exchanges. The effect of the interaction of behavior control and service type also depends on the presence of informal control.

Consumers value the flexibility to learn about the available offerings, complete their orders and obtain customer service across different channels in a convenient and integrated manner. Therefore, the retail industry has begun to use IT extensively to automate and integrate business processes across their traditional and online channels. This study examines the impacts of the use of IT by retail firms in integrating channel activities for selling to customers. Our research model argues that retail channel integration through IT should enhance the efficiency and innovation of a retail firm. In turn, these improvements should enhance their overall performance. We also propose that the environmental dynamism would moderate the effects of improvements in efficiency and innovation on firm performance. We draw upon recent theories in organizational resource integration and organizational learning to develop our research model and hypotheses. Based on survey data from 125 multichannel retailers in Singapore, we find that retail channel integration through the use of IT allows firms to not only be efficient in delivering the current offerings, but also be innovative in creating future offerings. Further, we find that environmental dynamism does positively moderate the effects of innovation ability on performance. Our results provide managerial insights for firms involved in digital integration not only in the retail sector but also in other service industries. These findings could also serve as a foundation for further research on service operations management for firms with both physical and online operations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['integration', 'efficiency', 'innovation']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of retail channel integration and firm performance, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This suggests that traditional supply chains have encountered limits to time-based competition in which the cost of faster replenishment exceeds the benefits. This paper explores and quantifies those limits to time-based competition in make-to-stock supply chains for functional products (products with stable demand over relatively long life cycles).\n            \n            The marginal value of time is used to define the limits of time-based competition in a supply chain, and we define it as the change in total inventory costs per unit change in supply chain lead-time. To calculate the value of time, we develop a set of simple analytical expressions that apply to most standard reorder-point inventory policies under deterministic and variable lead-times. By not requiring optimal inventory policies and expressing the value of time in terms of the unit cost of the product, we obtain very general results that are essentially product-free. We validate the analytical expressions using data from actual supply chains to simulate the inventory cost effects of changes in the lead-time. The results show that the marginal value of time in a supply chain is surprisingly low; it generally falls within a range of 0.4\u20130.8% of product unit cost per week.\n            \n            Our analytical models explain why there has been expansive growth in global supply chains for functional products. The key tradeoff in outsourcing is between reduced variable production cost and the increased inventory cost of longer supply chain lead-times. The models show analytically that the incremental inventory cost is extremely small relative to the cost benefit. The growth in global supply chains with long lead-times is cost, rather than time, driven.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.03.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and time-based competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Underpinned by loose coupling theory, we build a mediating framework in which we propose that a high level of justice (or fairness) as mutually perceived by both parties drives buyer\u2013supplier relationship performance through bolstered coupling links in mutual knowledge sharing, continuous commitment, and relationship investment. Our survey of 216 paired manufacturers (suppliers) and distributors (buyers) in China generally supports this argument, leading to a conclusion that justice is not a direct determinant of buyer\u2013supplier performance but a critical conduit that nourishes mid-range coupling behaviors, which in turn promotes a successful relationship. Based on findings from this study, firms are encouraged to endorse all four kinds of justice in managing supply chain relationships. However, when constrained by resources, the recommendation for managers is to focus on achieving a high level of perceptual convergence on procedural justice and informational justice with the exchange partner, because mutual perceptions of procedural and informational justice have the strongest effects on coupling behaviors and buyer\u2013supplier relationship performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.03.003","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['justice', 'fairness', 'procedural justice', 'informational justice']","The article emphasizes the importance of various types of justice in buyer-supplier relationships, suggesting a focus on fairness and ethical considerations in operations management.

The impact of these two strategies, however, has not been uniform across firms, calling for a deeper examination of their relative effectiveness. Utilizing multiple theoretical frameworks, this study examines the relevance and effectiveness of the two collaborative strategies across the growth and maturity stages of the product life cycle (PLC). Specifically, the study analyzes the influence of competitive intensity as an antecedent to supplier development and relational initiatives, and the role of product life cycle as a moderator of the inter-relationships among competitive intensity, supplier development, relational initiatives, and supplier capability. Based on primary survey data, and discussion with practicing managers, the study finds that the individual and integrative effectiveness of supplier development investments (SDI) and relational orientation (RO) can be influenced differently by competitive intensity and PLC stage. In particular, RO can have a foundational role in motivating SDI for superior supplier capability, as also in safeguarding against supplier opportunism in the standardized product market context of the maturity stage. The managerial and theoretical implications of varied emphasis on the two collaborative supplier management strategies across the PLC stages are discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.03.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier development', 'collaborative', 'relational initiatives']","The article focuses primarily on supplier management strategies and their effectiveness in relation to competitive intensity and product life cycle, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Using a unique data set of buyer\u2013supplier disputes, we find, in particular that increasing contractual control governance weakens the positive effect of cooperative relational experience on cooperative negotiation strategy. However, increasing contractual control governance for a buyer\u2013supplier dyad with competitive relational experience will increase cooperative negotiation strategy. Contractual coordination governance reinforces the positive effect of cooperative relational experience.

By comparing performance outcomes across a hierarchy of operating metrics, we establish a pattern of Six Sigma adoption effects that provides strong evidence of a positive impact on ROA. Interestingly, these ROA improvements arise mostly from significant reductions in indirect costs; significant improvements in direct costs and asset productivity are not evident. We also find small improvements in sales growth due to Six Sigma adoption. Cross-sectional analyses of the performance results reveal that distinctions in Six Sigma impacts across manufacturing and service firms are negligible. Interestingly, we find that the performance impact of Six Sigma adoption is negatively correlated to the firm's quality system maturity (indicated by prior ISO 9000 certification). Further analyses of manufacturing and service firms reveals that Six Sigma benefits are significantly correlated with intensity in manufacturing, and with financial performance before adoption in services.

Anecdotal evidence points to numerous situations where companies have failed to harness the potential of e-procurement. In this paper, we argue that online purchase volume and mix flexibilities facilitated by these applications play a significant role in the ability of firms to benefit from e-procurement. We examine this tenet from both an economic as well as a social perspective. We propose that increased online purchase volume flexibility as well as online purchase mix flexibility can be facilitated by two mechanisms \u2013 supplier customization as explained by transaction costs perspective, and information sharing between supply chain partners using a social exchange theoretical perspective. The increased purchase volume and mix flexibility in turn leads to better performance along the dimensions of cost, quality, and delivery. We present and test a nuanced perspective where we argue that (i) the effect of supplier customization on both purchase volume and mix flexibilities will be moderated by the frequency of transactions conducted online, and (ii) the effect of information sharing on both purchase volume and mix flexibilities will be moderated by trust in the supplier. We estimate our research model using survey data collected from 130 purchasing and procurement managers. We find strong support for our proposed research model with results indicating that purchase volume and mix flexibilities play a vital mediating role in impacting e-procurement performance.

Although there is a fairly large and growing body of anecdotal evidence associated with the benefits of implementing Six Sigma, there is very little systematic and rigorous research investigating these benefits. This research extends previous research in several important ways including utilizing a sample of 84 Six Sigma firms that represent a wide variety of industries and firm characteristics, utilizing rigorously constructed control groups to ensure the validity of our comparisons and conclusions, and investigating the impact of adopting Six Sigma on corporate performance over a ten year period. To carry out this investigation, the event study methodology is employed. The ten year period consists of three years prior to Six Sigma implementation, the event year corresponding to the year Six Sigma is adopted, and six years post Six Sigma implementation. To assess the impact of adopting Six Sigma on corporate performance we utilize commonly used measures including Operating Income/Total Assets (OI/A), Operating Income/Sales (OI/S), Operating Income/Number of Employees (OI/E), Sales/Assets (S/A), and Sales/Number of Employees (S/E). The sample Six Sigma firms are compared to different benchmarks including the overall industry performance and to the performance of carefully selected portfolios of control firms. The results of the study indicate that adopting Six Sigma positively impacts organizational performance primarily through the efficiency with which employees are deployed. More specifically, enhanced employee productivity results were observed in both static analyses that assessed the performance of the sample Six Sigma firms relative to their control groups at discrete points in time and dynamic analyses of the Six Sigma firms\u2019 rate of improvement relative to the rate of improvement of their control groups. Benefits in terms of improved asset efficiency were not observed.

This tradeoff determines the optimal extent of programmer participation in open source for the firm.  The extent of open source participation may also be influenced by the minimum compensation that must be paid to hire a programmer in the labor market.  This is because providing better skills is a way of compensating the programmers by improving their future market value.  Hence the firm may want to increase open source participation to keep direct wage payments in check. We develop an analytical model based on optimal control theory to characterize the employment contract that features the best mix of open source participation and wage payments.  We also find that the firm benefits more from the presence of open source in a tight labor market (i.e., when programmers have good options besides the employment offered by the firm).

If so, is this effect because such investments help improve sales, or is it because they help reduce overall operating expenses?  How does the effect of IT on profitability compare with that of advertising and of research and development?  These are important questions because investments in IT constitute a large part of firms\u2019 discretionary expenditures, and managers need to understand the likely impacts and mechanisms to justify and realize value from their IT and related resource allocation processes.  The empirical evidence in this paper, derived using archival data from 1998 to 2003 for more than 400 global firms, suggests that IT has a positive impact on profitability.  Importantly, the effect of IT investments on sales and profitability is higher than that of other discretionary investments, such as advertising and R&D.  A significant portion of the impact of IT on firm profitability is accounted for by IT-enabled revenue growth, but there is no evidence for the effect of IT on profitability through operating cost reduction.  Taken together, these findings suggest that firms have had greater success in achieving higher profitability through IT-enabled revenue growth than through IT-enabled cost reduction.  They also provide important implications for managers to make allocations among discretionary expenditures such as IT, advertising, and R&D.  With regard to IT expenditures, the results imply that firms should accord higher priority to IT projects that have revenue growth potential over those that focus mainly on cost savings.\n\nThis paper won the first-place award as European Research Paper of the Year for 2013.","https://misq.umn.edu/information-technology-and-firm-profitability-mechanisms-and-empirical-evidence.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of information technology investments and their impact on profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We identify a set of IT functionalities\u2014single-location shipping, multilocation shipping, supply chain visibility, and financial settlement\u2014that can be used to manage the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in interfirm logistics processes.  Progressively more advanced sets of IT functionalities, when implemented and used in the interfirm relationship to execute logistics processes, are proposed to form four distinct IT capability profiles of increased sophistication.  Interfirm IT capability profiles of higher sophistication are proposed to help cocreate greater relational value by facilitating the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in the interfirm logistics process.  Besides their direct role in helping cocreate relational value, these interfirm IT capability profiles are proposed to further enhance relational value cocreation when complemented by interfirm communications for business development and IT development.\n\nOur empirical study was situated in one of the world\u2019s largest logistics suppliers and over 2,000 of its interfirm relationships with buyers across industries.

We test this conjecture using the revenue distributions of books in over 200 distinct categories on Amazon.com and detailed daily snapshots of co-purchase recommendation networks in which the products of these categories are situated. We measure how much a product is influenced by its position in this hyperlinked network of recommendations using a variant of Google\u2019s PageRank measure of centrality.  We then associate the average influence of the network on each category with the inequality in the distribution of its demand and revenue, quantifying this inequality using the Gini coefficient derived from the category\u2019s Lorenz curve.  We establish that categories whose products are influenced more by the recommendation network have significantly flatter demand and revenue distributions, even after controlling for variation in average category demand, category size, and price differentials.  Our empirical findings indicate that doubling the average network influence on a category is associated with an average increase of about 50 percent in the relative revenue for the least popular 20 percent of products, and with an average reduction of about 15 percent in the relative revenue for the most popular 20 percent of products.  We also show that this effect is enhanced by higher assortative mixing and lower clustering in the network, and is greater in categories whose products are more evenly influenced by recommendations.  The direction of these results persists over time, across both demand and revenue distributions, and across both daily and weekly demand aggregations.  Our work illustrates how the microscopic economic data revealed by online networks can be used to define and answer new kinds of research questions, offers a fresh perspective on the influence of networked IT artifacts on business outcomes, and provides novel empirical evidence about the impact of visible recommendations on the long tail of electronic commerce.","https://misq.umn.edu/recommendation-networks-and-the-long-tail-of-electronic-commerce.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['inequality', 'recommendation', 'demand', 'revenue']","The article discusses the redistribution of demand and revenue in electronic commerce, touching on themes of inequality through the use of the Gini coefficient.

Coupled with the posited severe biasing effects of construct misspecification on structural parameters, these two assertions would lead to concluding that an important portion of our literature is largely invalid.  While we do not delve into the issue of when one specification should be employed over another, our work here contends that construct misspecification, but with a particular exception, does not lead to severely biased estimates.

Thus, a potential source of resistance to adopting a new system lies in the use of an incumbent system.  Using the status quo bias and habit literatures as theoretical lenses, the study explains how use of an incumbent system negatively impacts new system perceptions and usage intentions.  We argue that habitual use of an incumbent system, rationalization due to perceived transition costs, and psychological commitment due to perceived sunk costs all encourage development of inertia.  Inertia in turn fully mediates the impact of these incumbent system constructs on constructs related to acceptance of the new system via psychological commitment based on cognitive consistency and by increasing the importance of normative pressures.  Specifically, we hypothesize that inertia leads to decreased perceptions of the ease of use and relative advantage of a newly introduced system and has a negative impact on intentions to use the new system, above and beyond its impact through perceptions.  Finally, we hypothesize that inertia moderates the relationship between subjective norm and intention, such that normative pressures to use a new system become more important in the presence of inertia.  Empirical results largely support the hypothesized relationships showing the inhibiting effect of incumbent-system habit, transition and sunk costs, and inertia on acceptance of a new system.  Our study thus extends theoretical understanding of the role of incumbent system constructs such as habit and inertia in technology acceptance, and lays the foundations for further study of the interplay between perceptions and cognition with respect to the incumbent system and those with respect to a new system.","https://misq.umn.edu/shackled-to-the-status-quo-the-inhibiting-effects-of-incumbent-system-habit-switching-costs-and-inertia-on-new-system-acceptance.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of system adoption and user behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

They parameterize their simulation models using standardized coefficients in contrast to Jarvis et al., MacKenzie et al., and Petter et al., who parameterize their simulation models using unstandardized coefficients.  Thus, across these four simulation studies, biases in parameter estimates are likely to result in misspecified measurement models (i.e., using either unstandardized or standardized coefficients); yet, the biases are greater in magnitude when unstandardized coefficients are used to parameterize the misspecified model.  We believe that regardless of the extent of the bias, it is critically important for researchers to achieve correspondence between the measurement specification and the conceptual meaning of the construct so as to not alter the theoretical meaning of the construct at the operational layer of the model.

In this paper we build and test theory concerning a significant threat to the accuracy of information requirements, termed the misinformation effect. Misinformation is distorted, false, or other erroneous or misleading information that does not reflect the true state of the world or state of mind of the person communicating the information. The misinformation effect refers to the tendency of people to recall misleading or false information introduced to them following an event instead of original material learned or observed at the time the event occurred.  During user\u2013analyst communication in the IRD process, analysts may introduce misinformation in their discussions with users.  We use the misinformation effect literature to hypothesize that in such circumstances users are likely to recall misinformation introduced by analysts rather than their true beliefs and knowledge of facts.  Additionally, we use literature in social psychology to hypothesize that the misinformation effect will be stronger when misinformation is introduced using a social technique rather than a nonsocial technique.  We conducted an experiment to test the misinformation effect in the requirements elicitation process.  Results indicated that (1) introduction of misinformation reduces the accuracy of requirements provided by users, and (2) social techniques (interviews) are more vulnerable to the misinformation effect than nonsocial techniques (surveys).  Our research contributes to the information systems literature by identifying an important reason that requirements provided by users may be inaccurate, and to IRD practice by identifying important dilemmas caused by the misinformation effect as well as potential solutions.  We also contribute to the psychology literature by demonstrating the existence of the misinformation effect with users\u2019 experiential factual knowledge and beliefs in a business context, and by aiding in understanding the underlying causes of the misinformation effect.

Given that OIAs differ substantially from traditional, closed alliances in many aspects, including their strategic scope and scale, governing mechanisms, and member composition, it is important to understand and assess the potential value inherent in these new modes of collaboration.  Furthermore, OIAs evolve over time as the participating members are free to enter and leave at will.  Therefore, we also examine the on-going value creation and wealth spillover that result from changes in membership.  Moreover, we investigate how a firm\u2019s participation in an IT-based open alliance alters the market value of its rivals operating within the same marketplace.  To gain additional insight into the factors that moderate the market valuation of OIA participation, several contextual factors, including the degree of partner heterogeneity, innovation type, and degree of openness of the OIAs are used to account for variability in abnormal returns. Based on 194 observations, we found that allying firms realize significant positive abnormal returns when their entry into an OIA is made public.  The results also suggest that substantial excessive returns accrue to the allying firms with the belated entry of a market leader firm.  Furthermore, we discovered that a firm\u2019s entry into an OIA increases, rather than decreases, the market valuation of its rivals.  Interestingly, an incumbent rival that did not participate in the alliance appears to gain greater \u201cfree-riding\u201d benefits from the OIA, as compared to peer rivals.  Innovation type and openness were significantly associated with the amount of abnormal returns accruing to allying firms, while no significance was found for partner heterogeneity.

This growth translates into increased activity on the supporting infrastructure, leading to a corresponding need to scale the infrastructure.  This is difficult in an era of shrinking budgets and increasing functional requirements.  Increasingly, IT managers are turning to virtualized cloud providers, drawn by the pay-for-use business model.  As cloud computing becomes more popular, it is important for data center managers to accomplish more with fewer dollars (i.e., to increase the utilization of existing resources).  Advanced request distribution techniques can help ensure both high utilization and smart request distribution, where requests are sent to the service resources best able to handle them.  While such request distribution techniques have been applied to the web and application layers of the traditional online application architecture, request distribution techniques for the data layer have focused primarily on online transaction processing scenarios.  However, online applications often have a significant read-intensive workload, where read operations constitute a significant percentage of workloads (up to 95 percent or higher).  In this paper, we propose a cost-based database request distribution (C-DBRD) strategy, a policy to distribute requests, across a cluster of commercial, off-the-shelf databases, and discuss its implementation.  We first develop the intuition behind our approach, and describe a high-level architecture for database request distribution.  We then develop a theoretical model for database load computation, which we use to design a method for database request distribution and build a software implementation.  Finally, following a design science methodology, we evaluate our artifacts through experimental evaluation.  Our experiments, in the lab and in production-scale systems, show significant improvement of database layer resource utilization, demonstrating up to a 45 percent improvement over existing request distribution techniques.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-cost-based-database-request-distribution-technique-for-online-e-commerce-applications.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of database request distribution and resource utilization in e-commerce without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

The Effect of Filler Interfaces and Presentation Modes on Perceived Waiting Time Online","Long waits online undermine users\u2019 evaluations of Web sites and their providers, triggering abandonment behaviors.  Yet e-business researchers and practitioners have not perfected mechanisms to respond to online wait issues.  A filler interface that runs during the wait for search results may influence online users\u2019 perceived waiting time (PWT); however, no scientific investigation has attempted to design effective filler interfaces for managing online waits.  By adopting resource allocation theory, cognitive absorption theory, and human computer interaction (HCI) theories (competition for attention, visual search, and motion effect), we design diverse filler interfaces and investigate their effects on antecedents of PWT.  The proposed research model considers cognitive absorption factors such as temporal dissociation, focused immersion, and heightened enjoyment as antecedents of PWT, which in turn triggers three outcomes:  affective appraisals, cognitive appraisals, and Web site use intention. A multistage, multimethod approach is used to test the research hypotheses.  In the first stage, we compare a filler interface condition with a no-filler interface condition, and find the superiority of a filler interface with respect to inducing focused immersion and temporal dissociation.  In the second stage, we conduct two controlled experiments to examine whether filler interfaces with various designs (varying the presence and relevance of image, text, and image motion) distinctly influence antecedents of PWT and confirm their distinctive effects on focused immersion, temporal dissociation, and heightened enjoyment.  In addition, by conducting a structural equation modeling analysis, we find that our research model explains 51 percent, 51 percent, 44 percent, and 45 percent of the variance in PWT, affective appraisals, cognitive appraisals, and Web site use intention respectively.

We theorize that the enactment of clan control is a dual process of (1) building the clan by developing its social capital dimensions (structural, cognitive, and relational ties) or reappropriating social capital from elsewhere and (2) leveraging the clan  by reinforcing project-facilitating shared values, beliefs, and norms, and inhibiting those that impede the achievement of project goals.  We explore how clan control was enacted in a large IT project at a major logistics organization in which clan control was quickly instituted to avoid an impending project failure.

We focus on a critical manifestation of relational governance\u2014the presence of relational flexibility in the exchange relationship\u2014and argue that the enacted observation of relational flexibility is driven by perceptions of exchange hazards.  In a departure from extant literature, however, we propose that the benefits accruing from it are asymmetric and depend on how the exchange risks are apportioned by the formal contract.  Formally, we hypothesize that relational flexibility provides greater benefits to an exchange partner that faces the greater proportion of risk in a project, induced through the contract.  In addition, we hypothesize that these benefits manifest on the performance dimensions that are of importance to the risk-exposed partner.  We test our hypotheses on 105 software projects completed by a software outsourcing vendor for multiple clients.  The results show that relational flexibility positively affects profitability in only fixed price contracts, where the vendor faces greater risk, while positively affecting quality only in time and materials contracts, where the client is at greater risk.  We thus provide evidence for the asymmetric benefits from relational governance, thereby arguing for a more contingent and limited view of the value of relational governance, based on risk-exposure, rather than the more expansive view prevalent in the literature contending that relational governance provides benefits for all parties to an exchange.

This is amply reflected in recent surveys of CIOs, which consistently suggest that the notion of alignment is a top challenge and management priority.  Many CIOs face a double challenge when addressing the issue of alignment:  they must first clarify top management\u2019s expectations and assumptions about IT, which may be contradictory, and then understand their implications for how the IT department should be managed (i.e., translate the function\u2019s strategic mission into an IT management model that adds value to the organization).\n\nThe characterization of the IT function has constituted a central and growing subject of research in the information systems field.  Although the extant literature has much to teach us, knowledge in this area is nevertheless fragmented and has not been properly integrated.  In response to these limitations, this study proposes and tests a new theory of the contribution of the IT function.  Specifically, our objective is to offer an explanation of the contribution of the IT function in organizations with a typology of ideal profiles.\n\nA field study was conducted in 24 large Canadian companies in order to validate a set of research propositions.  Our results first suggest that there are five distinct \u201cideal\u201d IT management profiles in organizations and each of these profiles tends to focus on specific sources of value.  Next, we observed that IT functions that are close to the ideal of any given profile seem to be outperforming those with hybrid profiles.  Finally, our findings provide a compelling explanation as to how ideal IT management profiles are adopted in organizations.

This paper investigates how and why individual users revise their system use at the feature level.  A new concept, adaptive system use (ASU), is conceptualized as a user\u2019s revisions of which and how system features are used.  This research identifies four specific ASU behaviors that collectively describe how people revise their use of system features.  A model of ASU is developed based on Louis and Sutton\u2019s (1991) research on how people switch to active thinking from automatic thinking.  The model specifies three antecedents of ASU (novel situations, discrepancies, and deliberate initiatives) and two moderators (personal innovativeness in IT and facilitating conditions).  An empirical study of 253 Microsoft Office users largely supported the research model.  The findings suggest that triggers\u2015including novel situations, discrepancies, and deliberate initiatives\u2015are a significant impetus to ASU.  This research also confirms moderating effects of personal innovativeness in IT.  The findings also show the relationships among triggers:  in addition to their direct impact on ASU, novel situations and deliberate initiatives exert their influence on ASU indirectly by giving rise to discrepancies in system use.  Moreover, a cluster analysis identifies three heterogeneous triggering conditions and reveals that people engage in different ASU behaviors under different triggering conditions.","https://misq.umn.edu/understanding-user-revisions-when-using-information-systems-features-adaptive-system-use-and-triggers.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['adaptive system use', 'user revisions', 'personal innovativeness']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of information systems and user behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

We distinguish three types of IT innovations\u2014base, processes, and service innovation\u2014that form an innovation ecology.  We posit that (1) ACAP is a relational construct where the impact of the knowledge base is mediated by routines; (2) IT innovations are either externally adopted or internally generated; and (3) knowledge antecedents associated with different types of innovations differ.  We hypothesize a three-step, mediated path (knowledge base \u00e0 sensing \u00e0 experimentation \u00e0 innovation) for external innovation adoption, and a two-step path (knowledge diversity/depth \u00e0 experimentation \u00e0 innovation) for internal innovation creation to explain the software firm\u2019s level of radical innovation across three IT innovation types.  We validate the model through a cross-sector study that examined how 121 small software firms innovated with Internet computing.  We confirm the mediated nature of ACAP for external base innovations, which are driven by all three knowledge-based factors as follows:  (1) knowledge depth (direct positive effect); (2) knowledge diversity (mediated three-step path), (3) knowledge linkages (mediated three step path).  Process innovations are externally driven by a three-step mediated path for knowledge linkages, as well as being directly affected by knowledge diversity, but negatively and directly impeded by knowledge depth.  Service innovations are not driven by any mediated influence of ACAP, but driven directly by knowledge diversity.

It contends that some analysts argue that a composite should be represented as a relationship while others argue that a composite should be represented as an entity.  We find no evidence of such a dispute in the data modeling literature.  We observe that composites are objects.  By definition, all object-types should be represented as entities.  Therefore, using the relationship construct to represent composites should not be seen as a viable alternative.  Additionally, we found significant conceptual and methodological issues within the study that call its conclusions into question.  As a way to offer insight into the requisite methodological procedures for research in this area, we conducted two experiments that both explicate and address the issues raised.  Our results call into question the utility of using ontology as a foundation for conceptual modeling practice.

In this research note, we assess the utility of the unmeasured latent method construct (ULMC) approach in partial least squares (PLS), introduced by Liang et al. (2007).  Such an assessment of the ULMC approach is important, because it has been employed in 76 studies since it appeared in MIS Quarterly in early 2007.  Using data generated via Monte Carlo simulations, we use PLS structural equation modeling (SEM) to demonstrate that the ULMC approach of Liang et al. is neither able to detect, nor control for, common method bias.  Method estimates using this approach resulted in negligible estimates, regardless of whether there were some, large, or no method bias introduced in the simulated data.  Our study contributes to the IS and research methods literature by illustrating that, and explaining why the ULMC approach does not accurately detect common method bias in PLS.

In this article, we apply theory from the field of social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, an important dimension of community success.  We implemented and empirically tested two sets of community features for building member attachment by strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds.  To increase identity-based attachment, we gave members information about group activities and intergroup competition, and tools for group-level communication.  To increase bond-based attachment, we gave members information about the activities of individual members and interpersonal similarity, and tools for interpersonal communication.  Results from a six-month field experiment show that participants\u2019 visit frequency and self-reported attachment increased in both conditions.  Community features intended to foster identity-based attachment had stronger effects than features intended to foster bond-based attachment.

We used Monte Carlo simulation more extensively than previous research to evaluate PLS, multiple regression, and LISREL in terms of accuracy and statistical power under varying conditions of sample size, normality of the data, number of indicators per construct, reliability of the indicators, and complexity of the research model.  We found that PLS performed as effectively as the other techniques in detecting actual paths, and not falsely detecting non-existent paths.  However, because PLS (like regression) apparently does not compensate for measurement error, PLS and regression were consistently less accurate than LISREL.  When used with small sample sizes, PLS, like the other techniques, suffers from increased standard deviations, decreased statistical power,and reduced accuracy.  All three techniques were remarkably robust against moderate departures from normality, and equally so.

However, this is a strong assumption especially when the user is observed over a long period of time.  With the help of a data set on employees\u2019 blog reading behavior, we show that users\u2019 product selection behaviors change over time.  We propose a hidden Markov model to correctly interpret the users\u2019 product selection behaviors and make personalized recommendations.  The user preference is modeled as a hidden Markov sequence.  A variable number of product selections of different types by each user in each time period requires a novel observation model.  We propose a negative binomial mixture of multinomial to model such observations.  This allows us to identify stable global preferences of users and to track individual users through these preferences.  We evaluate our model using three real-world data sets with different characteristics.  They include data on employee blog reading behavior inside a firm, users\u2019 movie rating behavior at Netflix, and users\u2019 music listening behavior collected through last.fm.  We compare the recommendation performance of the proposed model with that of a number of collaborative filtering algorithms and a recently proposed temporal link prediction algorithm.

Specifically, based on social network and homophily paradigms in which individuals have a natural tendency to associate and interact frequently with others with similar characteristics, we constructed a relational inference model to determine the accuracy of self-administered consumer profiles.  In addition, to further enhance the reliability of our model\u2019s prediction capability, we employed the entropy mechanism that minimizes potential biases that may arise from a simple probabilistic approach.  To empirically validate the accuracy of our inference framework, we obtained and analyzed over 20 million actual call transactions supplied by one of the largest global telecommunication service providers.  The results suggest that our social network-based inference model consistently outperforms other competing mechanisms (e.g., weighted average and simple relational classifier) regardless of the criteria choice (e.g., number of call receivers, call duration, and call frequency), with an accuracy rate of approximately 93 percent.  Finally, to confirm the generalizability of our findings, we conducted simulation experiments to validate the robustness of the results in response to variations in parameter values and increases in potential noise in the data.

In such auction environments, bidders have the opportunity of participating in many auctions to learn and choose the bidding strategy that best fits their preferences.

Using a large data set collected from sequential online auctions, we first characterize bidding strategies in this interesting online environment and then develop an empirical model to explain bidders\u2019 adoption of different strategies.  We also examine how bidders change their strategies over time.  Our findings challenge the general belief that bidders employ their strategies regardless of experience or their specific demand.

Bidders with unit demand are likely to choose early bidding strategies, while those with multiple unit demand adopt late bidding strategies.  Auction design parameters that affect bidders\u2019 perception of demand and supply trends affect bidders\u2019 choice of bidding strategies.

One important type of user-generated content is the blog.  Blogs encompass useful information (e.g., insightful product reviews and information-rich consumer communities) that could potentially be a gold mine for business intelligence, bringing great opportunities for both academic research and business applications.  However, performing business intelligence on blogs is quite challenging because of the vast amount of information and the lack of commonly adopted methodology for effectively collecting and analyzing such information.  In this paper, we propose a framework for gathering business intelligence from blogs by automatically collecting and analyzing blog contents and bloggers\u2019 interaction networks.  Through a system developed using the framework, we conducted two case studies with one case focusing on a consumer product and the other on a company.  Our case studies demonstrate how to use the framework and appropriate techniques to effectively collect, extract, and analyze blogs related to the topics of interest, reveal novel patterns in the blogger interactions and communities, and answer important business intelligence questions in the domains.  The framework is sufficiently generic and can be applied to any topics of interest, organizations, and products.

We examine structural results explaining the reasons firms join an MSSP network, and characterize the growth of MSSP network size under different forms of ownership (monopoly versus consortium).  We find that the need for an initial investment in MSSP networks (which is necessary to overcome the stalling effect) only affects the optimal network size for a consortium but has no impact on the optimal network size for a profit-maximizing monopolist.  Our results provide an explanation why the majority of the MSSPs are for-profit entities and consortium-based MSSPs are less common.

Moreover, there is little evidence of the role and contributions of the individual mechanisms by which service providers create value for client firms.  We are particularly interested in whether client firms benefit from the accumulated knowledge held by information technology (IT) service firms.  In this paper, we examine the impact of IT outsourcing on the productivity of firms that choose this mode of services delivery focusing, on the role of IT-related knowledge.  Since firms self-select into their optimal sourcing mode, we use a variety of econometric techniques including propensity score-based matching and switching regression to control for potential bias arising from endogenously determined sourcing modes.  We demonstrate that IT outsourcing does lead to productivity gains for firms that select this mode of service delivery.  Our results also suggest that IT-related knowledge held by IT services vendors enables these productivity gains, the magnitude of which is moderated by a firm\u2019s IT intensity.  Moreover, the value of outsourcing to a client firm increases with its propensity for outsourcing, which in turn depends on firm-specific attributes including efficiency level, financial leverage, and variability in business conditions.

A 2009 article in Nature suggested new approaches to modeling economic meltdowns are needed to prevent future financial crises. However, existing studies have not focused on analysis of systemic risk at the individual bank level in a banking network, which is essential for monitoring and mitigating contagious bank failures.  To this end, we develop a network approach to risk management (NARM) for modeling and analyzing systemic risk in banking systems. NARM views banks as a network linked through financial relationships.  It incorporates network and financial principles into a business intelligence (BI) algorithm to analyze systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulations based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Our research demonstrates the feasibility of modeling and analyzing systemic risk at the individual bank level in a banking network using a BI-based approach.  In terms of business impact, NARM offers a new means for predicting contagious bank failures and determining capital injection priorities in the wake of financial crises.  Our simulation study shows that under significant market shocks, the interbank payment relationship becomes more influential than the correlated bank portfolio relationship in determining an individual bank\u2019s survival.  These insights should help financial regulators devise more effective policies and mechanisms to prevent the collapse of a banking system.

We use the literature on hyperbolic discounting to model consumers' self-control problems and examine conditions under which firms will offer small packages to help consumers combat their self-control problem, and how this offering in turn affects prices, profits, consumer, and social welfare. Our results show that introducing small packages can increase firms' profits only when a small fraction of consumers have overconsumption problems or when small packages can bring in new customers. Additionally, we find that competition can sometimes reduce the incentives for firms to introduce small packages. This is particularly true when a large fraction of consumers is attracted to small packages.

They may incur additional transaction costs when buying groceries online versus off-line. We integrate the various transaction costs into a channel choice framework and empirically quantify the relative transaction costs when households choose between the online and off-line channels of the same grocery chain. The key challenges in quantifying these costs are (i) the complexity of channel choice decision and (ii) that several of the costs depend on the items a household expects to buy in the store, and unobserved factors that influence channel choice also likely influence the items purchased. We use the unique features of our empirical context to address the first issue and the plausibly exogenous approach in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for the endogeneity of the channel choice drivers. We find that transaction costs for grocery shopping can be sizable and play an important role in the choice between online and off-line channels. We provide monetary metrics for several types of transaction costs, such as travel time and transportation costs, in-store shopping time, item-picking costs, basket-carrying costs, quality inspection costs, and inconvenience costs.

Such learning behavior is often embedded within a discrete choice framework that is then calibrated on scanner panel data. At the same time, it is now accepted wisdom that disentangling preference heterogeneity and state dependence is critical in any attempt to understand either construct. We posit that this confounding between state dependence and heterogeneity often carries through to Bayesian learning models. That is, the failure to adequately account for preference heterogeneity may result in over- or underestimation of the learning process because this heterogeneity is also reflected in the initial conditions. Using a unique data set that contains stated preferences (survey) and actual purchase data (scanner panel) for the same group of consumers, we attempt to untangle the effects of preference heterogeneity and state dependence, where the latter arises from Bayesian learning. Our results are striking and suggest that measured brand beliefs can predict choices quite well and, moreover, that in the absence of such measured preference information, the Bayesian learning behavior for consumer packaged goods is vastly overstated. The inclusion of preference information significantly reduces evidence for aggregate-level learning and substantially changes the nature of individual-level learning. Using individual-level outcomes, we illustrate why the lack of preference information leads to faulty inferences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0680","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'preferences', 'heterogeneity']","The article focuses on consumer behavior and preferences within a technical framework, lacking explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When such no-fault failures occur in confined zones, service providers may confine customers against their will if making arrangements for them to leave is very costly. Such confinements, however, can result in severe pain and suffering, and customer complaints put regulators under pressure to pass a customer bill of rights that allows captive customers to abort failed services. This paper shows that service providers are better off preempting such laws by voluntarily allowing customers to escape the service under failure. Moreover, service providers can profit by targeting compensation to customers based on whether they use or leave the service under failure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0683","","MKS","Marketing","4","['customer rights', 'compensation', 'service failure']","The article discusses the concept of a 'customer bill of rights' and the ethical implications of service failures, indicating a moderate focus on customer welfare and rights.

The model bridges the gap in the literature on hybrid multichannel supply chains with bilateral complementary products and services with or without revenue sharing. The analysis indicates that, without revenue sharing, the suppliers are reluctant to form exclusive deals with the retailers; thus, no equilibrium results. With revenue sharing from the retailers to the suppliers, it can be an equilibrium strategy for the suppliers and retailers to form exclusive deals. Bargaining solutions are provided to determine the revenue sharing rates. Our additional results suggest forming exclusive deals becomes less desirable for the suppliers if revenue sharing is also in place under nonexclusivity.

The Fashion Dilemma","There exists a dichotomy in the communication strategies of fashion firms\u2014some firms purposefully cloak information on the tastefulness of their products, whereas others openly flaunt their tasteful or \u201cit\u201d products. This divide in communication strategies cannot be explained by existing wealth signaling models of fashion. In this paper, we offer a model of fashion that explains the above dichotomy. We model fashion as a social device that plays the dual role of allowing people to both fit in with their peers and differentiate themselves by signaling their good taste or access to information. In this context, we show that a fashion firm faces an interesting dilemma\u2014if it restricts information, then only sophisticated consumers buy its products and use them to signal their taste. Cloaking thus preserves the signaling value of its products but reduces the number of social interactions enabled by them. In contrast, flaunting undermines the signaling value of its products but increases the interactions enabled by them. Given these trade-offs, we derive the conditions under which cloaking occurs. We also show that, in equilibrium, the most tasteful product endogenously emerges as the fashion hit or \u201cit\u201d product.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0689","","MKS","Marketing","2","['communication strategies', 'social device', 'taste', 'signaling']","The article primarily focuses on the marketing strategies of fashion firms without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

When consumers can freely maintain their anonymity, they all individually choose to do so, which results in the highest profit for the monopolist.

In these markets, retailers often use dynamic markdown policies in which an initial retail price is announced at the beginning of the season and the price is subsequently marked down as the season progresses. Strategic consumers face a trade-off between purchasing early in the season, when prices are higher but goods are available, and purchasing later, when prices are lower but the stockout risk is higher.

We model a monopolist manufacturer with a new innovation that can be sold to two potential customers. We demonstrate here two benefits of a reference program that relate not to an increase in later adopters' willingness to pay but to an increase in the willingness to pay of the early adopters themselves. The impact on the early adopters' willingness to pay arises in two ways as a result of their observation of the firm's commitment to information transmission. First, in a model of symmetric uncertainty, we show that the announcement of a reference program facilitates dynamic pricing by the manufacturer in the sense that it allows the firm to provide temporary exclusive use of the technology to one of the customers. This creates more value, which the manufacturer can extract via a higher price. In this way, a reference program can serve as a partial substitute for an exclusive-use contract. In a model with asymmetric information, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the firm is able to use the reference program as a signal\u2014again, to the early adopting customer\u2014that its technology is of high quality. However, such a signal requires significant discounts to early adopters to ensure separation. As a result, a pooling equilibrium dominates in which the manufacturer fosters references regardless of its quality. Finally, by allowing the firms' private information to be stochastic, we show that separation may be a dominant outcome.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0695","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of business-to-business marketing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The resulting diffusion model captures seasonality in a way that naturally matches the original diffusion model's pattern. The method assumes that additional sales at seasonal peaks are drawn from previous or future periods. This implies that the seasonal pattern does not influence the underlying diffusion pattern. The model is compared with alternative approaches through simulations and empirical examples. As alternatives, we consider the standard Generalized Bass Model (GBM) and the basic Bass Model, which ignores seasonality. One of the main findings is that modeling seasonality in a GBM generates good predictions but gives biased estimates. In particular, the market potential parameter is underestimated. Ignoring seasonality in cases where data of the entire diffusion period are available gives unbiased parameter estimates in most relevant scenarios. However, ignoring seasonality leads to biased parameter estimates and predictions when only part of the diffusion period is available. We demonstrate that our model gives correct estimates and predictions even if the full diffusion process is not yet available.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0696","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for modeling seasonality in product diffusion without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We posit that a customer's value (CV) comes not only from her purchase value (PV) but also from her influence value (IV) (i.e., CV = PV + IV). Therefore, a customer's value can be far greater than her purchase value if she exerts a considerable influence on others. Building on a two-segment influential\u2013imitator asymmetric influence model, we develop a model framework to derive closed-form expressions for PV, IV, and CV by customer segment as well as time of adoption, and we examine their comparative statics with respect to the diffusion parameters. A key parameter of our model framework is the social apportioning parameter, \u03b4, which determines the credit a customer receives by influencing other potential adopters. We develop an endogenous method for determining \u03b4 as a function of the new product diffusion parameters. Our model framework allows us to investigate how a firm might accelerate product purchases by providing introductory discount offers to a targeted group of potential adopters at product launch.

Our model can handle large quantity values and produces WTP estimates that are positive and increasing in quantity at a diminishing rate. In particular, we propose a tractable WTP function that depends on both product attributes and product quantity and that captures diminishing marginal WTP. We show how such a function embeds standard WTP functions in the quantity discount literature as special cases.

In our empirical application to a customer-to-customer marketplace, we find that contributor (seller) acquisition has the largest financial value because of their strong network effects on content consumers (buyers) and other contributors. However, the wear-in of contributors' financial values takes longer because the network effects need time to be fully realized.

In this paper, we argue that the value of collaborative user-generated content is a function both of the direct efforts of its contributors and of its embeddedness in the content\u2013contributor network that creates it. An analysis of Wikipedia's WikiProject Medicine reveals a curvilinear relationship between the number of distinct contributors to user-generated content and viewership. A two-mode social network analysis demonstrates that the embeddedness of the content in the content\u2013contributor network is positively related to viewership. Specifically, locally central content\u2014characterized by greater intensity of work by contributors to multiple content sources\u2014is associated with increased viewership. Globally central content\u2014characterized by shorter paths to the other collaborative content in the overall network\u2014also generates greater viewership. However, within these overall effects, there is considerable heterogeneity in how network characteristics relate to viewership. In addition, network effects are stronger for newer collaborative user-generated content. These findings have implications for fostering collaborative user-generated content.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0684","","MKS","Marketing","3","['collaborative', 'user-generated content', 'contributors']","The article discusses collaborative user-generated content, which hints at inclusivity and collective effort, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects and viewership metrics rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

To do so, we develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users. Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP) print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when \u201cfree\u201d promotional activities by content creators exist.

The open source community features two separate but related subcommunities: developer users who contribute time and effort to develop products and end users who act as collaborative testers and provide feedback. We develop hypotheses concerning how the location of the project's founders in the social network of developer users, the interplay of developer users and end users, and project and product characteristics affect time to product release. We use data on 817 development projects from SourceForge, a large open source community forum, to calibrate a split hazard model to test the hypotheses. That model supports the two-community conceptualization and most of the related hypotheses.

However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the \u201cbest-value\u201d hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0700","","MKS","Marketing","3","['user-generated content', 'consumer preferences', 'social media']","The article discusses the use of user-generated content and consumer preferences, which hints at a consideration for diverse consumer needs.

We distinguish between intraconnectivity\u2014the ability of one firm's customers to connect to each other\u2014and interconnectivity\u2014the ability of one firm's customers to connect with another firm's customers. The profitability implications of allowing connectivity are not a straightforward consequence of the consumer value of connectivity, because connectivity affects not only the customer value but also the intensity of competition by creating or changing network externality. We find that if sales are driven by brand switching rather than by category expansion, a firm may find it optimal not to provide intraconnectivity even if providing it is not costly and may find it optimal to provide interconnectivity even at a cost exceeding the consumer value of connectivity. On the other hand, if category expansion is possible, providing intraconnectivity may be profitable. In this case, either the equilibrium intraconnectivity provision may be asymmetric or both firms may find it (individually) optimal to provide intraconnectivity. Under certain conditions in the latter case, the firms' choice of intraconnectivity is a prisoner's dilemma game.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0705","","MKS","Marketing","2","['value creation', 'connectivity', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of connectivity and profitability without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The effect of social sharing on firm pricing and profits depends critically on two elements: the structure of the underlying consumer network and the mechanism used by groups to decide whether to purchase at a given price. We examine the effect of social sharing under different network structures (decentralized, centralized, and complete), which reflect a range of market conditions. Moreover, we draw from the mechanism design literature to examine several approaches to group decision making. Our results suggest that a firm can benefit from increased social sharing if the level of sharing is already high, enabling a pricing strategy targeted primarily at sharing groups rather than individuals. However, the point at which sharing becomes marginally beneficial for a firm depends on both the distribution of group sizes (which derives from the network structure) and the group decision mechanism. Additional insights are obtained when we extend the model to capture homophily in group formation and the potential that a subset of consumers will never share for ethical reasons.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0706","","MKS","Marketing","5","['social sharing', 'ethical reasons', 'group decision making']","The article discusses social sharing and includes a mention of 'ethical reasons' for not sharing, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations within a marketing context.

This is a large, understudied targeted marketing and price discrimination problem. This problem falls into a broader class of configuration utility problems (CUPs), which typically require an approach tailored to exploit the particular setting. This paper provides such an approach for the admission and scholarship decisions problem. The approach accounts for the key distinguishing feature of this industry\u2014schools value the average features of the matriculating students such as percent female, percent from different regions of the world, average test scores, and average grade point average. Thus, as in any CUP, the value of one object (i.e., student) cannot be separated from the composition of all of the objects (other students in the enrolling class). This goal of achieving a class with a desirable set of average characteristics greatly complicates the optimization problem and does not allow the application of standard approaches. We develop a new approach that solves this more complex optimization problem using an empirical system to estimate each student's choice and the focal school's utility function. We test the approach in a field study of an MBA scholarship process and implement adjusted scholarship decisions. Using a holdout sample, we provide evidence that the methodology can lead to improvements over current management decisions. Finally, by comparing our solution to what management would do on its own, we provide insight into how to improve management decisions in this setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0707","","MKS","Marketing","5","['diversity', 'scholarships', 'students', 'average characteristics']","The article discusses the optimization of admission and scholarship decisions with a focus on the composition of student demographics, such as 'percent female' and 'percent from different regions of the world,' indicating a moderate emphasis on diversity and inclusion in the marketing context."],["2012","31","4","Yaniv DoverYaniv Doveryaniv.dover@yale.eduYale School of Management, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520Search for more papers by this author, Jacob GoldenbergJacob Goldenbergmsgolden@huji.ac.ilJerusalem School of Business Administration, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel 91905; and Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author, Daniel ShapiraDaniel Shapirashapirad@bgu.ac.ilGuilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management, Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel 84105Search for more papers by this author","Network Traces on Penetration: Uncovering Degree Distribution from Adoption Data","We show how networks modify the diffusion curve by affecting its symmetry.

Specifically, using external sources of information, we confirm that each network degree distribution identified by the model matches the actual social network that is underlying the dissemination process.

The framework is that of a first-order Markov process with three states. The objective of both firms is to maximize profits. We are able to demonstrate, for a diminishing returns advertising function, that the optimal advertising strategy is pulsing. The frequency of the advertising pulse is shown to depend on the magnitude of the market share retention rate (state dependence); the higher it is, the less frequent the advertising. We further find that the optimal advertising budgets do not remain the same when the frequency of pulsing changes.

Moreover, the preference evolution in a certain category can spill over to other categories; i.e., consumers can exhibit cross-category learning. In this paper, we develop a multicategory framework to analyze the role of the above elements in the formation and evolution of consumer preferences across categories. We analyze these elements by employing multiple data sets, i.e., by combining revealed preference data (from scanner panel), stated data (from surveys measuring consumer lifestyle variables and demographics), and external influences (e.g., media mentions) in a completely heterogeneous framework while considering other facets of the learning process. By jointly estimating the model for organic purchases in six distinct food categories, we also explore the role of category differences. Results show that consumer new product adoption and learning is indeed impacted significantly and to various degrees by the aforementioned factors. We show how, by selectively encouraging purchases under various scenarios, firms can accelerate the learning process, not only for the focal category but also for other categories, thereby realizing considerable incremental profits. These results can be used by both manufacturers and retailers for more efficient allocation of marketing budgets across (new) products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0717","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'preferences', 'marketing', 'learning']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we test our predictions using two large-scale samples that span 30 product categories. Results indicate that the NLEA reduced brand nutritional quality relative to a control group of products not regulated by the NLEA. At the same time, among regulated products, brand taste increased. Although this reduction in nutrition represents an unintended consequence of regulation, there were a set of category, firm, and brand conditions under which the NLEA produced a positive effect on brand nutritional quality. We find that firms were more likely to improve brand nutrition when firm risk or firm power is low. Lower risk occurs when the firm is introducing a new brand rather than changing an existing brand, and weaker power in a category is reflected by lower market share in a category. Furthermore, firms competing in low-health categories (e.g., potato chips) or small-portion categories (e.g., peanut butter) improved nutrition more than firms competing in high-health categories (e.g., bread) or large-portion categories (e.g., frozen dinners). Recommendations for firm strategy and the design of consumer information policy are examined in light of these surprising firm responses.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0692","","MKS","Marketing","3","['nutrition', 'labeling', 'consumer information']","The article discusses the implications of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act on food products, which touches on consumer welfare and information policy.

In organizational settings, this can lead to reduced productivity and profits. We use the literature on present-biased preferences to model employees' self-control problems and examine how firms can design compensation plans to reduce the negative consequences of their employees' self-control problems. Our results suggest that firms can mitigate self-control problems by delaying payment to the employees. This can be achieved by using multiperiod quotas (such as annual quotas) to compensate employees for their cumulative performance. Although such plans are prevalent in the market, there is little theoretical research that shows when multiperiod quota plans can be optimal. The paper provides one potential explanation for the widespread use of such quota plans. Interestingly, we find that such plans may be optimal despite the fact that they encourage more procrastination. We also find that such plans lead to higher effort by the employees and can sometimes improve the welfare of not only the firm but also the employees.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0714","","MKS","Marketing","2","['self-control', 'compensation', 'productivity']","The article primarily focuses on self-control and compensation plans in organizational settings, with an emphasis on productivity and profits.

This paper examines an understudied systematic response tendency in surveys: the extent to which observed responses are subject to state dependence, i.e., response carryover from one item to another independent of specific item content. We develop a statistical model that simultaneously accounts for state dependence, item content, and scale usage heterogeneity. The paper explores how state dependence varies by response category, item characteristics, item sequence, respondent characteristics, and whether it becomes stronger as the survey progresses. Two empirical applications provide evidence of substantial and significant state dependence. We find that the degree of state dependence depends on item characteristics and item sequence, and it varies across individuals and countries. The article demonstrates that ignoring state dependence may affect reliability and predictive validity, and it provides recommendations for survey researchers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0722","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of survey response processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

(Existing literature has assumed either that brand extension is cost-neutral or that it costs more.) I show that it can as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, but the argument is unconvincing. For one thing, the separating equilibrium is not unique; a pooling equilibrium also exists in which brand extension signals nothing. For another, the separating equilibrium relies on off-equilibrium beliefs that are poorly motivated in the model. I propose a refinement of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium that resolves both issues. Empirical off-equilibrium beliefs require that consumers' off-equilibrium beliefs be justifiable on the basis of their prior beliefs and product performance observations. With empirical off-equilibrium beliefs, two necessary conditions for brand extension to signal product quality are identified: (i) consumers must perceive old and new products of the firm to be positively correlated in quality, and (ii) at least some consumers must identify with brands and not the firm behind the brands. Even with these conditions in place, the signaling argument is fragile: firm observability of past performance diminishes brand extension's signaling capability; an arbitrarily small probability of failure for good products eliminates it. My results suggest that, going forward, the case for brand extension must rest on foundations other than signaling product quality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0723","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of brand extension and product quality signaling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This question has been particularly controversial for advertising on search engines. In June 2009, Google started allowing any third-party reseller of a product to use a trademark such as \u201cDoubleTree\u201d in the text of its ad, even if the reseller did not have the trademark holder's permission. We study the effects of this change empirically within the hotel industry. We find some evidence that allowing third-party sellers to use a trademark in their online search advertising weakly reduced the likelihood of a consumer clicking on a trademark holder's paid search ads. However, the decrease in paid clicks was outweighed by a large increase in consumers clicking on the unpaid links to the hotelier's website within the main search results. Our evidence shows that when a third-party seller focuses on a trademarked brand in its ads, the ads become less distinct, and customers are more likely to ignore the advertised offers and buy from the direct channel.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0724","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of trademark usage in online advertising without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Bidders may be motivated by different goals, e.g., thrill (of winning the item, with minimal attention to what they pay for it) versus prudence (winning the item at a price at or below its perceived value). Also, innate or auctioneer-induced differences may exist in the precision and salience of bidder cognitions about the item's value. We report two studies on how these motivational and cognitive factors influence bids in descending and ascending auctions, respectively. Each study also manipulated a situational variable (wait time at each price step). The two auctions realized different average prices for the same item set. Average bids were higher in the descending (versus ascending) auction in several study conditions. In both auction formats, bidders primed with thrill (versus prudence) bid higher, but more precise and/or salient values attenuated this goal effect. Among other results, in the descending auction, longer wait times elicited higher bids from bidders primed with thrill (but not prudence). In the ascending auction, longer wait times produced lower bids for bidders primed with prudence (but not thrill). These findings on consumer bidding behavior have practical implications for auction design.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0730","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer bidding behavior in auctions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Past literature offers deep insights about bundling by a single firm whose unit costs are not impacted by choice of selling strategy. But when the retailer bundles goods from separate manufacturers, unit costs for the bundler (retailer) are, being the prices set by the manufacturers, no longer exogenous. This alters the economic balance with respect to bundling. I show that channel conflicts weaken the case for bundling. Although bundling is better than component selling for the integrated firm, it is no longer so in the decentralized channel. The culprit is a combination of vertical channel conflict (incentive misalignment with respect to bundle versus component sales) and horizontal conflict (each manufacturer wants a higher share of profits from bundle sales), with the latter playing a dominant role. They cause manufacturers to overprice component goods, weakening the retailer's incentives to bundle. The competitive interplay between firms when one (retailer) merges the prices of several (manufacturers) leads to lower profits for all. Price coordination between the firms could partially restore the role of bundling and improve the firms' profits as well as consumer surplus.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0725","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product bundling and economic dynamics within distribution channels without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated.

The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule.

We examine how a retailer's advantage in providing consumer shopping experience affects its equilibrium pricing and price advertising strategies. We find that if the consumer valuation of a shopping experience is sufficiently low, its effect on retailer strategy is similar to that of quality, and the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience then deploys higher levels of price advertising. On the other hand, when the shopping experience is valuable enough for consumers, it acts akin to price advertising in that it makes it optimal for the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience to eschew price advertising. The optimal competitive investments in consumer shopping experience can be higher than that of a monopoly. The profit impact of shopping experience for a retailer depends on the level of shopping experience: for low levels, the profit impact depends on the difference in the levels between the retailers, but for high enough levels, it depends only on whether the retailer's shopping experience level is higher than that of its competitor. In this case, even small differences in shopping experience levels can result in large differences in equilibrium profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0734","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on competitive strategies and pricing in retail without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To prevent deliberation, the firm may have to offer downgraded quality at a low price so that an impulsive purchase will not appear too wasteful. Whether the firm should induce deliberation depends on how much surplus it creates by aligning the supply of quality with heterogeneous demand for quality and how much surplus it captures during this process. Interestingly, equilibrium firm profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare can all increase with the cost of deliberation. We extend the model to accommodate consumers' heterogeneous prior beliefs of their valuations for quality.

Prior work in marketing has mainly focused on the aggregate impact of WOM on product sales as well as the generation of WOM. Very little attention has been paid to the consumption or usage of WOM. In this paper, utilizing a unique data set that collects information from the automobile category on whether a consumer generates WOM to others and uses WOM for making purchase decisions, we build a discrete-choice model to study consumer WOM generation and WOM consumption decisions simultaneously and empirically answer questions that have not been explored previously. We are particularly interested in studying the key drivers of WOM generation/consumption and the synergy effect between the two WOM-related activities. We apply the proposed model to survey data collected on the automobile category. We find a strong synergy between WOM generation and WOM consumption. Although some consumers view WOM generation and WOM consumption as complementary to each other, others tend to perceive the two activities as competing with each other. We also find that consumer product experience and media exposure are positively correlated with their propensity to generate WOM. However, their effect on WOM consumption is mixed. Our empirical analysis also provides evidence of unobserved heterogeneity in the way consumer WOM activities are related to consumer product experience. Overall, these findings lead to important managerial implications on targeting for effective use of WOM as a marketing tool.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0738","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of word-of-mouth marketing and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, SAW produces superior predictions over traditional methods, such as the Bass model or Gompertz law, and can form predictions for a completely new technology by incorporating information from other categories on time-varying covariates.

This paper studies the strategic aspects of such advertising, considering an intermediary who has access to a content base, sells advertising space to advertisers who compete in the product market, and provides the targeting technology. The results show that contextual targeting impacts advertiser profit in two ways: First, advertising through relevant content topics helps advertisers reach consumers with a strong preference for their product. Second, heterogeneity in consumers' content preferences can be leveraged to reduce product market competition, especially when competition is intense. The intermediary has incentives to strategically design its targeting technology, sometimes at the cost of the advertisers. When product market competition is moderate, the intermediary offers accurate targeting such that the consumers see the most relevant ads. When competition is high, the intermediary lowers the targeting accuracy such that the consumers see less relevant ads. Doing so intensifies competition and encourages advertisers to bid for multiple content topics in order to prevent their competitors from reaching consumers. In some cases, this may lead to an asymmetric equilibrium where one advertiser bids high even for the content topic that is more relevant to its competitor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0740","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contextual advertising and its impact on advertiser profits without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Here we contribute to this burgeoning literature by extending it to a number of key behavioral anomalies that are thought to be of importance for consumption, savings, and portfolio selection decisions. Using survey-based evidence from more than 11,000 Swedish twins, we demonstrate that a number of anomalies such as, for instance, the conjunction fallacy, default bias, and loss aversion are moderately heritable. In contrast, our estimates imply that variation in common environment explains only a small share of individual differences. We also report suggestive evidence in favor of a shared genetic architecture between cognitive reflection and a subset of the studied anomalies. These results offer some support for the proposition that the heritable variation in behavioral anomalies is partly mediated by genetic variance in cognitive ability.

The dual-system framework presented here distinguishes heuristic assessments of value and evidence strength from deliberative assessments that incorporate prior odds and likelihood ratios following Bayes' rule. Hypotheses are derived regarding the relative sensitivity of judged probabilities, buying prices, and selling prices to case- versus class-based evidence. We test these hypotheses using a simulated stock market in which participants can learn from experience and have incentives for accuracy.

Cooperative Behavior Whenthe Stakes Are Large (p. 2) Martijn J. van den Assem, Dennie van Dolder, Richard H. Thaler Split or steal? That's the primary question in the British game show Golden Balls. As it turns out, the game show tests a variation on the famous \u201cprisoner's dilemma\u201d game theoretic problem. The two contestants are better off collectively if they cooperate and agree to share, but they have individual incentives to try to \u201csteal\u201d the entire pot that averages more than $20,000. If they both steal, they get nothing. The variation from the classic game theoretic problem is that the contestants can communicate their intentions, even if they might be dishonest. The authors study the show and make a number of observations. First, cooperation is surprisingly high for amounts that would usually be considered consequential but look tiny in the context of the game, what the authors call a \u201cbig peanuts\u201d phenomenon. Second, the authors find evidence that people demonstrate reciprocity; that is, contestants repay kindness with kindness or unkindness with unkindness. The authors find little support for contestants cooperating based on rational projections of competitors' behavior based on their stated intentions; that is, players do not seem to be more likely to cooperate if their opponent might be expected to cooperate. Third, the authors' findings support prior game theoretic findings that young males are less cooperative than females but that this gender effect reverses for older contestants: Men become increasingly cooperative as their age increases.

E. Magnusson, Bj\u00f6rn Wallace Are our economic decisions\u2014such as consumption, savings, and portfolio selection decisions\u2014a function of heredity or environment? Using evidence from more than 11,000 Swedish twins, the authors demonstrate that a number of economic behaviors are moderately heritable and that variation in common environment explains only a small share of individual differences. However, heterogeneity of economic decisions may be partially due to genetic variance in cognitive ability. The insight for management: Genetic differences are a source of heterogeneity in economic and financial decision making.A Model of Casino Gambling (p. 35) Nicholas Barberis Why do people go to casinos? In 2007, 55 million people made 376 million trips to casinos in the United States alone, despite their obviously negative expected payoff. Prospect theory helps explain why lottery tickets are popular despite their negative expected payout\u2014so little to lose, so much to gain; however, this skewed payout does not apply to casinos, where payouts are not so highly skewed. The author describes a time inconsistency: At the moment a gambler enters a casino, he plans to follow one particular gambling strategy; but after he starts playing, he wants to switch to a different strategy. Interestingly, the model predicts heterogeneity in gambling behavior: How a gambler behaves depends on whether he is aware of the time inconsistency. The insight for management: Gambler behaviors can be better understood, increasing potential earnings from gamblers.The Impact of Personal Experience on Behavior: Evidence from Video-Rental Fines (p. 52) Michael P. Haselhuhn, Devin G. Pope, Maurice E. Schweitzer, Peter Fishman After renting the movie Apollo 13, Reed Hastings misplaced his video cassette. He found the cassette six weeks later and faced a $40 late fee. The experience of paying this late fee was so aversive for Hastings that it motivated him to take an action that would fundamentally change the entire video-rental industry: In 1997, Hastings founded Netflix. In short, personal experience matters. But how much? In a field setting with longitudinal data, the authors disentangle the effects of learning new information from the effects of personal experience. They find that after a customer experiences a fine they are much more likely to comply in the future. The effect is more significant after a large fine. They also note that the influence of experience with both large and small fines decays sharply over time. The insight for management: Negative financial incentives have a significant effect on future behavior.Norms and Contracting (p. 62) Judd B.

The authors find that \u201chandshake agreements\u201d (unenforceable components of a contract) establish \u201cinduced norms\u201d that are endogenous to a relationship and that agents feel beholden to follow. The disutility of deviating from norms in a relationship is enough to hold participants to agreements. The insight for management: Norms for unenforceable \u201chandshake agreements\u201d can effectively substitute for weak enforceable restrictions.The Impact of Gender Composition on Team Performance and Decision Making: Evidence from the Field (p. 78) Jose Apesteguia, Ghazala Azmat, Nagore Iriberri Researchers have long evaluated gender preferences as they relate to decision making. Generally, researchers have found that women are more risk averse than men and women are more averse to competition. How do these preferences translate to a group setting? The authors investigate whether the gender composition of teams affects their economic performance. In experiments with both undergraduates and MBA students, the authors show that teams formed by three women are significantly outperformed by all other gender combinations. Undergraduate women are outperformed throughout, but top-performing women are closer to men at the top of the distribution. The authors show that, for MBA students, the best-performing group constitution is two men and one woman. The authors show that the differences in performance are explained by differences in gender-specific approaches to decision making. They suggest that, generally, three-women teams are less aggressive in their pricing strategies, invest less in research and development, and invest more in social sustainability initiatives than does any other gender combination. The insight for management: The gender constitution of a group directly affects its approach to decision making and its performance.Feedback, Self-Esteem, and Performance in Organizations (p. 94) Camelia M. Kuhnen, Agnieszka Tymula How do both positive and negative feedback affect performance? The authors examine whether feedback improves performance in competitive environments by modifying the agents' self-esteem. In their experiments, even the prospect of getting feedback is motivating; people work harder when told that they may learn their ranking, relative to cases when they don't get feedback. Interestingly, feedback has an inverse relationship with performance. Individuals who ranked better than expected decreased their subsequent output, whereas those who ranked worse than expected increased their output. Employees are rational; their expected future ranking changes with learned feedback on current rank. They are competitive as well; ranking feedback helps create a ratcheting effect in the fight for dominance. The insight for management: Organizations can improve employee productivity by changing the likelihood of feedback, the reference group used to calculate relative performance, and the quality of the information of the feedback message.Gender, Competition, and Managerial Decisions (p. 114) Curtis R. Price How does a manager's gender affect the choice of compensation plans for employees? In experiments, the author gave managers a choice of performance-based compensation plan for a subordinate: either a piece rate or a tournament payment scheme. The author finds that, given information about worker ability, male managers chose the tournament significantly less often for a female worker. On the other hand, when no information about worker ability was given to the manager, there was no difference in compensation choice for the worker. The insight for management: Choice of compensation plans depends not only on the information the manager has on worker performance, but importantly on the gender of the manager making the choice.Aggregation and Manipulation in Prediction Markets: Effects of Trading Mechanism and Information Distribution (p. 123) Lian Jian, Rahul Sami Prediction markets\u2014markets in which traders buy and sell bets on future events\u2014are designed to explicitly take advantage of the information aggregation function of market prices to provide decision makers with forecasts of future events. Such markets have been created for a wide range of applications such as the Iowa Electronic Market for forecasting elections and the Hollywood Stock Exchange for forecasting movie box office receipts. Often, such markets are conducted as a continuous double auction, but increasingly market scoring rules are being used as an alternative. The authors conduct laboratory experiments on variants of market scoring rule prediction markets, under different information distribution patterns, to evaluate the efficiency and speed of information aggregation, and they test recent theoretical results on manipulative behavior by traders. The authors find that markets structured to have a fixed sequence of trades exhibit greater accuracy of information aggregation than the typical form that has unstructured trade. In comparing two commonly used mechanisms, they find no significant difference between the performance of the direct probability-report form and the indirect security-trading form of the market scoring rule. In the case of the markets with a structured order, they find evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that information aggregation is slower when information is complementary. The insight for management: Different market structures and information dissemination methods help to improve the accuracy of predictive markets.Apologies as Signals: With Evidence from a Trust Game (p. 141) Benjamin Ho \u201cLove means never having to say you're sorry\u201d is a famous line from the 1970 movie Love Story. Is the expression true? More than just romantic relationships, apologies are part of a social institution designed to restore frayed relationships not only in personal life but also in corporate domains such as product recalls, medical malpractice litigation, political malfeasance, and the like. When and why do people and institutions apologize? Interestingly, the author suggests that Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw (who said the famous quote) were wrong\u2014apologies are more frequent in long relationships, early in relationships, and between better-matched partners. So, an apology is, in fact, an indicator of a healthy and sustainable relationship. The insight for management: The words \u201cI am sorry,\u201d or their equivalent, don't necessarily suggest weakness or guilt of past events; instead, apologies are forward looking\u2014a desire to sustain an ongoing relationship into the future.A Case-Based Model of Probability and Pricing Judgments: Biases in Buying and Selling Uncertainty (p. 159) Lyle A. Brenner, Dale W. Griffin, Derek J. Koehler Are assets priced rationally and accurately in an environment of uncertainty? The authors show that, despite giving participants incentives for accurate pricing and an opportunity for experiential learning, people demonstrate systematic biases in their experiment of a simulated stock market. The insight for management: People exhibit distinct patterns of miscalibration for buying prices, selling prices, and probability judgments.Paying to Be Nice: Consistency and Costly Prosocial Behavior (p. 179) Ayelet Gneezy, Alex Imas, Amber Brown, Leif D. Nelson, Michael I. Norton Do we give until it hurts? The authors suggest that we tend to make giving a habit only if it hurts. The authors find in a laboratory experiment and a large field study that a major contributor to charitable behavior is the costliness of an initial gift. If that initial gift is costly, then the decision maker may develop a prosocial identity that spurs future giving. However, if it is not costly, the decision maker may not try to live up to the reputation of being prosocial and, in fact, might exhibit more greedy behaviors subsequent to the initial gift. The insight for management: Charitable behavior is more likely to become a habit if initial gifts impose some cost on the giver.Imprecise Data Sets as a Source of Ambiguity: A Model and Experimental Evidence (p. 188) Ayala Arad, Gabrielle Gayer Suppose you have to undergo some medical treatment. You have the precise information that the treatment was successful in 25 of 50 past cases. Now imagine that, in addition to that information, you are notified that the outcomes of 20 other cases were lost because of some technical problem, making the overall success rate of the treatment unknown. How would you feel about undergoing the treatment in the second scenario compared to the first? Would the presence of imprecise information lower your confidence in the treatment, or would you ignore the unknown data? The insight for management: With precise data, subjects behave as if there were no ambiguity, whereas with imprecise data subjects turn out to be ambiguity averse.A Multimethod Approach to Identifying Norms and Normative Expectations Within a Corporate Hierarchy: Evidence from the Financial Services Industry (p. 203) Stephen V. Burks, Erin L. Krupka How do ethical expectations and norms affect decision making in cases such as whistle-blowing on a peer, an incentive clash between serving the client and earning commissions, or a dilemma about fiduciary responsibility to a client? The authors use both economic experiments and surveys at a large financial services firm to identify the norms for on-the-job behavior among financial advisers and their leaders, and the effect that the expectations of each group has on the other. The authors find patterns of agreement among advisers, among leaders, and between the two groups that are consistent with company guidelines. However, the authors do find measurable differences between what leaders expect and the actual norms of advisers. The authors are able to distinguish between differences that result from miscommunication and ethical disagreement between leaders and advisers. The insight for management: If advisers' personal ethical opinions do not match group norms, job dissatisfaction can result.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1504","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['gender', 'cooperation', 'ethical', 'behavior', 'decision making']","The article discusses gender differences in decision-making and cooperation, which touches on themes of gender equity and ethical behavior in management.

Specific proposals vary in their choice of conversion trigger and conversion mechanism. We analyze the case of contingent capital with a capital-ratio trigger and partial and ongoing conversion. The capital ratio we use is based on accounting or book values to approximate the regulatory ratios that determine capital requirements for banks. The conversion process is partial and ongoing in the sense that each time a bank's capital ratio reaches the minimum threshold, just enough debt is converted to equity to meet the capital requirement, so long as the contingent capital has not been depleted. We derive closed-form expressions for the market value of such securities when the firm's asset value is modeled as geometric Brownian motion, and from these we get formulas for the fair yield spread on the convertible debt. A key step in the analysis is an explicit expression for the fraction of equity held by the original shareholders and the fraction held by converted investors in the contingent capital.

This means that a predictable risk premium is not equal to compensation for systematic risk as implied by asset pricing theory. We show that introducing market frictions relaxes these asset pricing moments from a strict equality to a range. Empirically, it is not short sales constraints but transaction costs (below 35 basis points) that help to reconcile the observed predictability with linear portfolio return-based factor models, and partly with the durable consumption model. Across the sorts, predictability in industry returns can be reconciled with all models considered with only a 25 basis point transaction cost, whereas for momentum and ROA portfolios, up to 115 basis points are needed.

We first characterize a market equilibrium under a general, single buyback contract. We show that the buyer's stocking decision can be distorted in equilibrium. Such a downstream stocking distortion hurts the buyer firm's own performance, and it also influences the performances of the supplier and the supply chain. We further reveal scenarios where full supply chain efficiency cannot be reached under any single buyback contract. Then, focusing on contract design, we characterize conditions under which a menu of buyback contracts can prevent downstream stocking distortion and restore full efficiency in the supply chain. Our study demonstrates that in a supply chain context, a firm's incentive to undertake real economic activities to influence capital market valuation can potentially be resolved through operational means.

Business interruption (BI) insurance offers firms a financial mechanism for managing their exposure to disruption risk. Firms can also avail of operational measures to manage the risk. In this paper, we explore the relationship between BI insurance and operational measures. We model a manufacturing firm that can purchase BI insurance, invest in inventory, and avail of emergency sourcing. Allowing the insurance premium to depend on the firm's insurance and operational decisions, we characterize the optimal insurance deductible and coverage limit as well as the optimal inventory level. We prove that insurance and operational measures are not always substitutes, and we establish conditions under which they can be complements; that is, insurance can increase the marginal value of inventory and can increase the overall value of emergency sourcing. We also find that the value of insurance is higher for those firms less able to absorb financially significant disruptions. As disruptions become longer but rarer, the value of emergency sourcing increases, and the value of inventory and the value of insurance increase before eventually decreasing.

A little studied question is how dividend smoothing, as a choice of corporate policy, affects predictability. We show that even if dividends are supposed to be predictable without smoothing, dividend smoothing can bury this predictability. Because aggregate dividends are dramatically more smoothed in the postwar period than before, the lack of dividend growth predictability in the postwar period does not necessarily mean that there is no cash flow news in stock price variations; rather, a more plausible interpretation is that dividends are smoothed.

However, as acknowledged by the authors, when counting the number of adopters who substitute an old product generation with a new generation, the NB model does not differentiate those who have already adopted the old generation from those who have not. In this study, we develop a generalized Norton\u2013Bass (GNB) model that separates the two different types of substitutions. The GNB model provides closed-form expressions for both the number of units in use and the adoption rate, and offers greater flexibility in parameter estimation, forecasting, and revenue projection. An appealing aspect of the GNB model is that it uses exactly the same set of parameters as the NB model and is mathematically consistent with the later. Empirical results show that the GNB model delivers better overall performance than previous models both in terms of model fit and forecasting performance. The analyses also show that differentiating leapfrogging and switching adoptions based on the GNB model can help gain additional insights into the process of multigeneration diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GNB model can incorporate the effect of marketing mix variables on the speed of diffusion for all product generations.

The retailers choose their orders strategically, and if their orders exceed the supplier's capacity, quantities are allocated proportionally to the orders. We experimentally study the capacity allocation game using subjects motivated by financial incentives. We find that the Nash equilibrium, which assumes that players are perfectly rational, substantially exaggerates retailers' tendency to strategically order more than they need. We propose a model of bounded rationality based on the quantal response equilibrium, in which players are not perfect optimizers and they face uncertainty in their opponents' actions. We structurally estimate model parameters using the maximum-likelihood method. Our results confirm that retailers exhibit bounded rationality, become more rational through repeated game play, but may not converge to perfect rationality as assumed by the Nash equilibrium.

Using a comprehensive database of American prisoners of war during World War II, the authors find that survival from captivity generally declines as the hierarchy of a prisoner's group becomes steeper or more closely matches the military's established hierarchy. The insight for management: The military's WWII hierarchy was too inflexible to adapt from the battlefield to captivity.A Generalized Norton\u2013Bass Model for Multigeneration Diffusion (p. 1887) Zhengrui Jiang, Dipak C. Jain The Norton\u2013Bass (NB) model is often credited as the pioneering multigeneration diffusion model in marketing. However, as acknowledged by the authors, when counting the number of adopters who substitute an old product generation with a new generation, the NB model does not differentiate those who have already adopted the old generation from those who have not. In this study, the authors develop a generalized Norton\u2013Bass (GNB) model that separates the two different types of substitutions. The GNB model provides closed-form expressions for both the number of units in use and the adoption rate, and it offers greater flexibility in parameter estimation, forecasting, and revenue projection. An appealing aspect of the GNB model is that it uses exactly the same set of parameters as the NB model and is mathematically consistent with the latter. Empirical results show that the GNB model delivers better overall performance than previous models in terms of both model fit and forecasting performance. The analyses also show that differentiating leapfrogging and switching adoptions based on the GNB model can help gain additional insights into the process of multigeneration diffusion. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the GNB model can incorporate the effect of marketing mix variables on the speed of diffusion for all product generations.Managing Disruption Risk: The Interplay Between Operations and Insurance (p. 1898) Lingxiu Dong, Brian Tomlin Disruptive events that halt production can have severe business consequences if not appropriately managed. Business interruption (BI) insurance offers firms a financial mechanism for managing their exposure to disruption risk. Firms can also use operational measures to manage the risk. What is the relationship between BI insurance and operational measures to mitigate BI costs? The authors characterize the interaction of the optimal insurance deductible and coverage limit as well as the optimal inventory level. They find that insurance and operational measures are not always substitutes and establish conditions under which they can be complements; that is, insurance can increase the marginal value of inventory and can increase the overall value of emergency sourcing. The authors also find that the value of insurance is higher for those firms less able to absorb financially significant disruptions. As disruptions become longer but rarer, the value of emergency sourcing increases, and the value of inventory and the value of insurance increase before eventually decreasing. The insight for management: BI insurance and inventories have complex interactions in the effort to mitigate business interruption risk.Asset Pricing Restrictions on Predictability: Frictions Matter (p. 1916) Frans de Roon, Marta Szymanowska Asset pricing models predict a risk\u2013price relationship that is not always observed empirically. What is the explanation for deviations? The authors sort U.S. stock portfolios on size, momentum, transaction costs, market-to-book, investment-to-assets, return-on-assets (ROA) ratios, and industry classification, and they find considerable levels and variation of return predictability, inconsistent with asset pricing models. The authors show that a predictable risk premium is not equal to compensation for systematic risk as implied by asset pricing theory. Their explanation: Market frictions create these deviations, converting an equality into a range prediction. Transaction costs (below 35 basis points) help to reconcile the observed predictability. The authors find that predictability in industry returns can be reconciled with a 25- to 115-basis-point transaction cost. The insight for management: Market friction in the form of transaction costs can affect the predicted valuation of an asset.Supply Chain Performance Under Market Valuation: An Operational Approach to Restore Efficiency (p. 1933) Guoming Lai, Wenqiang Xiao, Jun Yang How is supply chain performance affected by market valuation? The authors study the stocking decision of a buyer who has the incentive to influence their capital market valuation. They find that the buyer's decisions are suboptimal in some cases, which hurts the buyer firm's own performance, and it also influences the performances of the supplier and the supply chain. The authors characterize conditions under which a menu of buyback contracts can prevent downstream stocking distortion and restore full efficiency in the supply chain. The insight for management: In a supply chain context, a firm's incentive to undertake real economic activities to influence capital market valuation can potentially be resolved through operational means.Modeling Bounded Rationality in Capacity Allocation Games with the Quantal Response Equilibrium (p. 1952) Yefen Chen, Xuanming Su, Xiaobo Zhao How does proportional rationing of capacity in time of short supply affect ordering behavior? The authors experimentally study the capacity allocation game and find that the prevailing theoretical \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d solution, which assumes that players are perfectly rational, substantially exaggerates retailers' tendency to strategically order more than they need. The authors consider a model of bounded rationality in which players are not perfect optimizers and face uncertainty in their opponents' actions. The authors find that participants become more rational through repeated game play but may not converge to perfect rationality as assumed by the Nash equilibrium. The insight for management: Rational behavior is often assumed but is not always followed in complex games with uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1656","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['risk-taking', 'behaviors', 'religious beliefs']","The article discusses the influence of local religious beliefs on mutual fund risk-taking behaviors, which touches on behavioral aspects but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

However, defection to low quality impairs the firm's reputation, which lowers cash flows and inhibits production over the long term. Financing via short-term claims discourages defection to low quality because the gains from defection are mostly captured by outside investors through an increase in the value of their claims.

We consider a tractable (continuous-time) model of gradual learning, in which consumers incur search costs to learn further product information, and update their expected utility of the product at each search occasion. We characterize the optimal stopping rules for either purchase, or no purchase, as a function of search costs and of the importance/informativeness of each attribute. This paper also characterizes how the likelihood of purchase changes with the ex ante expected utility, search costs, and the importance/informativeness of each attribute. We discuss optimal pricing, the impact of consumer search on profits and social welfare, and how the seller chooses its price to strategically affect the extent of the consumers' search behavior. We show that lower search costs can hurt the consumer because the seller may then choose to charge higher prices. Discounting creates asymmetry in the purchase and no-purchase search thresholds, and may lead to lower prices if search occurs in equilibrium, or higher prices if there is no search in equilibrium. This paper also considers searching for signals of the value of the product, heterogeneous importance of attributes, endogenous intensity of search, and social learning.

Theory and Experiments","We study a procurement setting in which the buyer seeks a low price but will not allocate the contract to a supplier who has not passed qualification screening. Qualification screening is costly for the buyer, involving product tests, site visits, and interviews. In addition to a qualified incumbent supplier, the buyer has an entrant of unknown qualification. The buyer wishes to run a price-only, open-descending reverse auction between the incumbent and the entrant, and faces a strategic choice about whether to perform qualification screening on the entrant before or after the auction. We analytically study the buyer's optimal strategy, accounting for the fact that under postauction qualification, the incumbent knows he could lose the auction but still win the contract. In our analysis, we derive the incumbent's optimal bidding strategy under postauction qualification and find that he follows a threshold structure in which high-cost incumbents hold back on bidding\u2014or even boycott the auction\u2014to preserve their profit margin, and only lower-cost incumbents bid to win. These results are strikingly different from the usual open-descending auction analysis where all bidders are fully qualified and bidding to win is always a dominant strategy. We test our analytical results in the laboratory, with human subjects. We find that qualitatively our theoretical predictions hold up quite well, although incumbent suppliers bid somewhat more aggressively than the theory predicts, making buyers more inclined to use postauction qualification.

This requires inferring the extent to which each store generates incremental sales as opposed to competing with other stores belonging to the chain for the same set of customers. However, when the chain is experiencing a growth or a decline in sales, not accounting for these dynamics in goodwill is likely to yield misleading estimates of incremental sales versus cannibalization. Moreover, firms might have been strategic in opening outlets in locations with favorable characteristics. We need to control for this location endogeneity while inferring the marginal effect of store opening/closure. In this paper, we develop a demand model that accounts for dynamics in goodwill, location endogeneity, and spatial competition between geographically proximate retail outlets. We calibrate the model parameters on both attitudinal and behavioral data for a fast food chain in a large U.S. city. The results imply that consumers perceive a travel cost of $0.60 per mile. As regards the composition of sales at individual stores, on average, 86.7% of sales constitute incremental purchases with the rest derived from cannibalized sales from nearby stores belonging to the chain. We also find significant decay in cannibalization with distance such that when the distance between stores increases by one mile, the sales lost due to cannibalization decreases by 28.1%; there is virtually no cannibalization at a distance of 10 miles. In terms of managerial applications, we discuss how managers can use the model presented in this paper to make two key decisions: (a) isolating locations that can be closed by identifying stores that yield the lowest marginal benefit to the chain and (b) dealing with franchisees' potential concerns about cannibalization.

Women do not enter the tournament significantly more often when it is team based, but men enter significantly less when they are part of a team than when alone. The main reason for men's disaffection with team competition appears to be linked to the uncertainty of their teammate's performance in a team tournament. More precisely, high-performing men fear being the victims of the free-riding behavior of their teammate.

While producing high quality is best, defecting to low quality is tempting because it lowers current costs while revenue remains unchanged because consumers and outside investors cannot immediately observe the defection. However, defection to low quality impairs the firm's reputation, which lowers cash flows and inhibits production over the long term. Interestingly, financing via short-term claims discourages defection to low quality because the gains from defection are mostly captured by outside investors through an increase in the value of their claims.

Miguel Villas-Boas Consumers often need to search for product information before making purchase decisions. But how do they decide whether to shop, or stop? Consumers have to decide when enough search is enough when balancing the costs of search with the potential benefits of better product or lower price. The authors develop the optimal stopping rules for either purchase, or no purchase, as a function of search costs and of the importance of each attribute. Given the search behavior of the consumer, sellers can construct pricing strategies that maximize profits. Interestingly, the authors show that lower search costs can hurt the consumer because the seller may then choose to charge higher prices. The insight for management: Understanding search behavior can help improve the probability of sale and improve profits.When Does It Pay to Delay Supplier Qualification? Theory and Experiments (p. 2057) Zhixi Wan, Damian R. Beil, Elena Katok Should suppliers always be prequalified? The authors study a procurement setting in which the buyer seeks a low price but will not allocate the contract to a supplier who has not passed qualification screening. Qualification screening is costly for the buyer, involving product tests, site visits, and interviews. The buyer has an incumbent whose quality is known and an entrant that must be screened. The buyer faces a strategic choice about whether to perform qualification screening on the entrant before or after the auction. Under postauction qualification, the incumbent knows he could lose the auction but still win the contract. The incumbent might boycott the auction in this situation, whereas if the participants are fully screened the incumbent's best strategy is always to bid. The insight for management: The timing of quality screening of suppliers directly affects supplier bidding strategy.Coordination of Price Promotions in Complementary Categories (p. 2076) Maxim Sinitsyn The Betty Crocker cake mix box tells us, \u201cFrost with Betty Crocker Creamy Deluxe or Whipped Frosting,\u201d but does that influence the consumer's decision on frosting? How does this suggestion affect pricing? Some consumers are \u201cloyals,\u201d who purchase both products from their preferred firm, and some are \u201cswitchers,\u201d who choose between product bundles or buy a product in a single category. The switchers are willing to pay some price premium to purchase two complementary products that share the same brand name and are produced by the same firm because they believe that these products are a better match than two complementary products with different brand names.

This structure encompasses a number of known models (e.g., expected utility and several variants under a concave utility function). The authors show that such preferences share a representation in terms of a family of measures of risk and targets. Specifically, the choice function is equivalent to selection of a maximum index level such that the risk of beating the target at that level is acceptable. This representation may help to uncover new models of choice. One that the authors explore in detail is the special case when the targets are bounded. This case corresponds to a type of satisficing and has descriptive relevance.

Such gains in knowledge have come primarily via laboratory experiments\u2014a missing piece of the puzzle in many cases is parallel evidence drawn from naturally occurring field counterparts. We provide a small movement in this direction by taking advantage of a unique opportunity to work with a Chinese high-tech manufacturing facility. Our study revolves around using insights gained from one of the most influential lines of behavioral research\u2014framing manipulations\u2014in an attempt to increase worker productivity in the facility. Using a natural field experiment, we report several insights. For example, conditional incentives framed as both \u201closses\u201d and \u201cgains\u201d increase productivity for both individuals and teams. In addition, teams more acutely respond to bonuses posed as losses than as comparable bonuses posed as gains. The magnitude of this framing effect is roughly 1%: that is, total team productivity is enhanced by 1% purely due to the framing manipulation. Importantly, we find that neither the framing nor the incentive effect lose their significance over time; rather, the effects are observed over the entire sample period. Moreover, we learn that repeated interaction with workers and conditionality of the bonus contract are substitutes for sustenance of incentive effects in the long run.

Firms that produce such conspicuously consumed goods such as designer apparel, fashion goods, jewelry, etc., often face challenges in making optimal pricing and production decisions. Such firms are confronted with precipitous trade-off between high sales volume and high margins, because of the highly uncertain market demand, strategic consumer behavior, and the display of conspicuous consumption. In this paper, we propose a model that addresses pricing and production decisions for a firm, using the rational expectations framework. We show that, in equilibrium, firms may offer high availability of goods despite the presence of conspicuous consumption. We show that scarcity strategies are harder to adopt as demand variability increases, and we provide conditions under which scarcity strategies could be successfully adopted to improve profits. Finally, to credibly commit to scarcity strategy, we show that firms can adopt sourcing strategies, such as sourcing from an expensive production location/supplier or using expensive raw materials.

Because there are typically profound uncertainties in these models, a simulation approach is often used. This approach requires the distribution of the uncertain parameters clearly specified. However, this is typically impossible because there is often a significant amount of ambiguity (e.g., estimation error) in specifying the distribution. In this paper, we adopt the widely used multivariate normal distribution to model the uncertain parameters. However, we assume that the mean vector and covariance matrix of the distribution are within some ambiguity sets. We then show how to find the worst-case performance of a given policy for all distributions constrained by the ambiguity sets. This worst-case performance provides a robust evaluation of the policy. We test our algorithm on a famous integrated model of climate change, known as the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE model). We find that the DICE model is sensitive to the means and covariance of the parameters. Furthermore, we find that, based on the DICE model, moderately tight environmental policies robustly outperform the no controls policy and the famous aggressive policies proposed by Stern and Gore.

The PO method builds on a dual characterization of optimal stopping problems as optimization problems over the space of martingales, which we dub the martingale duality approach. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that the PO method produces upper bounds of a quality comparable with state-of-the-art approaches, but in a fraction of the time required for those approaches. As a by-product, it yields lower bounds (and suboptimal exercise policies) that are substantially superior to those produced by state-of-the-art methods. The PO method thus constitutes a practical and desirable approach to high-dimensional pricing problems. Furthermore, we develop an approximation theory relevant to martingale duality approaches in general and the PO method in particular. Our analysis provides a guarantee on the quality of upper bounds resulting from these approaches and identifies three key determinants of their performance: the quality of an input value function approximation, the square root of the effective time horizon of the problem, and a certain spectral measure of \u201cpredictability\u201d of the underlying Markov chain. As a corollary to this analysis we develop approximation guarantees specific to the PO method. Finally, we view the PO method and several approximate dynamic programming methods for high-dimensional pricing problems through a common lens and in doing so show that the PO method dominates those alternatives.

The marketer offers royalty contracts to the innovator. We find that the potential for royalty revision leads to more severe distortions in the optimal initial royalty contracts offered by the marketer. We show that if the innovator plays a significant role in the marketing stage, the marketer should offer a low royalty rate initially and then revise the royalty rate up later. Otherwise, she should do the opposite. We identify two major effects of royalty revision. First, royalty revision provides the marketer with a flexibility to dynamically adjust royalty rates across the two stages of the alliance to better align the innovator's incentives. This incentive-realigning effect improves the marketer's profit. Second, royalty revision makes it harder for the marketer to obtain private information from the innovator, because the innovator worries that the marketer will take advantage of the information to revise the initial contract to a more favorable one to herself later. This information-revealing effect hurts the marketer's profit. We characterize in what kind of alliances marketers would benefit the most from royalty revision so that managers should clearly establish the expectation for royalty revision, and in what kind of alliances markerters would not benefit from royalty revision so that managers should commit not to revise the initial royalty contract. With royalty contracts that are contingent on the R&D outcome of the R&D stage, we find that contingent contract structure could be either substitutable (by fully capturing the incentive re-aligning effect) or complementary (by weakening the information revealing effect) to royalty revision, depending on whether the innovator plays a significant role in the marketing stage. Managers may need to use a contingent contract (if possible) either to replace or with royalty revision accordingly to improve profits.

Experimental economists have found that by framing an option as the lesser of two evils, rather than the better of two benefits, they can dramatically affect decision makers' choices. The authors extend these experimental results by taking advantage of a unique opportunity to work with a Chinese high-tech manufacturing facility in an attempt to increase worker productivity in the facility. The authors found that conditional incentives framed as both \u201closses\u201d and \u201cgains\u201d increase productivity for both individuals and teams. In addition, teams more acutely respond to bonuses posed as losses than to comparable bonuses posed as gains.

Producers are confronted with precipitous trade-off between high sales volume and high margins, because of the highly uncertain market demand, strategic consumer behavior, and the display of conspicuous consumption. The authors show that firms may offer high availability of goods despite the presence of conspicuous consumption.

The authors suggest that in order to credibly commit to scarcity strategy, firms can adopt sourcing strategies, such as sourcing from an expensive production location/supplier or using expensive raw materials.

Jeff Hong How can the validity of long-term projections on global warming be validated and their accuracy assessed? Because there are typically profound uncertainties in the geophysical and economic inputs to these models, a simulation approach is often used. This approach requires the distribution of the uncertain parameters clearly specified; however, this is typically impossible because there is often a significant amount of ambiguity from estimation error in specifying the distribution. The authors use a worst-case approach to account for this ambiguity to produce robust evaluation of policy. They test the algorithm on a famous integrated model of climate change, known as the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE model), and they find that the DICE model is sensitive to the means and covariance of the parameters. The authors evaluate previously proposed and well-known policies, such as Al Gore's proposal that aims to reduce the global CO2 by 90% by 2050, and Britain's Sir Nicholas Stern's claims that spending only 1%\u20132% of the global GDP now could save the future potential climate loss at a magnitude of around 20% of the global GDP.

If both quantities are low, then the optimal portfolio consists of a mix of familiar and unfamiliar assets; moreover, an increase in correlation between assets causes an investor to increase concentration in familiar assets (flight to familiarity). Alternatively, if both quantities are high, then the optimal portfolio contains only the familiar asset(s), as Keynes would have advocated. In the extreme case in which both quantities are very high, no risky asset is held (nonparticipation).

We find that when sentiment is high, analysts' forecasts of one-year-ahead earnings and long-term earnings growth are relatively more optimistic for \u201cuncertain\u201d or \u201cdifficult-to-value\u201d firms. Adding these forecast errors to a regression of stock returns on sentiment absorbs a sizable fraction of the explanatory power of sentiment for the cross section of future returns. This finding provides direct support for the notion that investor sentiment affects the earnings expectations of hard-to-value firms.

Using a utility formulation inspired by regret theory, we derive closed-form solutions. When the degree of foreign aversion is high in a given country, investors place a high valuation on domestic equity, which results in a low expected return. Thus, the model generates the simple prediction that a country's degree of home bias and the expected return of its domestic assets should be inversely related. Our predicted relation between the degree of home bias and a country's expected return has the opposite sign predicted by models that assume some form of market segmentation.

We discuss and test three explanations for these results. Finally, 24-hour returns also vary by price point, and buy\u2013sell imbalances are a major determinant of that variation across price points.

Using previously identified firm characteristics, we find that most of the negative returns to uncertain firms in months following high-sentiment periods fall within the three-day window around the issuance of management earnings guidance. Comparisons of guidance months to nonguidance months show that guidance issuance affects the magnitude and not just the daily distribution of negative returns. There is also some evidence of negative returns around earnings announcements for firms that previously issued guidance, suggesting that guidance does not entirely correct optimistic earnings expectations. To provide additional insight into the strength of the guidance effect, we show that the market reacts more strongly to surprises, particularly negative surprises, following high-sentiment periods. Finally, firms with higher transient institutional ownership are less likely to guide, and their guidance is less likely to contain bad news following high-sentiment periods, indicating that managers with a short-term focus are hesitant to correct optimistic market expectations.

The author investigates the impact of social ties on the effectiveness of boards of directors.

Although being ousted is costly for all CEOs\u2014who must then devote time to finding new employment and succeed in only 62% of cases\u2014socially connected CEOs are more likely to find new and better employment after a forced departure.

Warren Buffett has quoted Keynes and espouses this approach to investing. On the other hand, Harry Markowitz has won the Nobel Prize in Economics for developing portfolio diversification methods and models to reduce risk for a given desired return. Which approach should be followed? The authors show that for any given level of expected returns, the optimal portfolio depends on two quantities: relative ambiguity across assets and the standard deviation of the expected return estimate for each asset. If both quantities are low, then the optimal portfolio consists of a mix of familiar and unfamiliar assets; moreover, an increase in correlation between assets causes an investor to increase concentration in familiar assets (flight to familiarity). Alternatively, if both quantities are high, then the optimal portfolio contains only the familiar asset(s), as Keynes would have advocated. In the extreme case in which both quantities are very high, no risky asset is held (nonparticipation). The insight for management: Portfolio diversification strategies and investing in few familiar assets are competing philosophies that can be reconciled based on risk, correlation of assets, and relative ambiguity of the investment options.A Global Equilibrium Asset Pricing Model with Home Preference (p. 273) Bruno Solnik, Luo Zuo Are investors biased toward domestic investments? The authors test the assumption that investors suffer from foreign aversion, a preference for home assets based on familiarity. They find that, if the degree of foreign aversion is high in a given country, investors place a high valuation on domestic equity, which results in a low expected return. Using International Monetary Fund portfolio data, the authors test the model's prediction that a country's degree of home bias and the expected return of its domestic assets are inversely related. The insight for management: Expected returns for a country's assets are negatively related to home bias.Investor Sentiment and Analysts' Earnings Forecast Errors (p. 293) Paul Hribar, John McInnis Are stock analysts sentimental? The authors examine the correlation of analysts' forecast errors with investor sentiment. They find that when sentiment is high, analysts' forecasts of one-year-ahead earnings and long-term earnings growth are relatively more optimistic for \u201cuncertain\u201d or \u201cdifficult-to-value\u201d firms. They find that these errors contain information; regression analysis of the errors has sizable predictive ability on future returns. The insight for management: Evaluate both what analysts say and what they may feel; investor sentiment may affect the earnings expectations of hard-to-value firms.The Party's Over: The Role of Earnings Guidance in Resolving Sentiment-Driven Overvaluation (p. 308) Nicholas Seybert, Holly I. Yang \u201cIrrational exuberance\u201d is a famous term coined by Alan Greenspan to steer enthusiastic investors riding a bull market back to reality. It worked; a major stock market correction ensued. Can senior management provide earning guidance that helps prevent investors' sentiment-driven overvaluation? The authors find that most of the negative returns to uncertain firms in months after high-sentiment periods fall within the three-day window around the issuance of management earnings guidance. But there is also some evidence of negative returns around earnings announcements for firms that previously issued guidance, suggesting that guidance does not entirely correct optimistic earnings expectations. The authors suggest that transient or short-term focused management are more likely to fail to provide effective earnings guidance. The insight for management: Regular and clear earnings guidance can help avoid irrational expectations of investors and subsequent abrupt and negative corrections.The Accrual Anomaly: Risk or Mispricing? (p. 320) David Hirshleifer, Kewei Hou, Siew Hong Teoh When investors value a firm, they should distinguish between the two components of earnings: cash flows from operations and accounting adjustments (operating accruals). Because cash flows from operations predict future profitability more strongly than do accruals, investors should discount accruals and focus on cash flows. However, past research has found that firms with high accruals underperform compared with firms with low accruals in the United States and in other countries. This pattern has come to be known as the accrual anomaly. The authors confirm that accrual characteristics cause investors to overvalue stocks. The insight for management: Investors misvalue the accrual characteristic and cast doubt on the rational risk explanation.Investor Inattention and the Market Impact of Summary Statistics (p. 336) Thomas Gilbert, Shimon Kogan, Lars Lochstoer, Ataman Ozyildirim Can a little information go a long way? The authors examine the effect of recurring stale information releases on U.S. stock and Treasury futures prices. The authors evaluate the effect of the U.S. Leading Economic Index\u00ae (LEI), which is released monthly and is constructed as a summary statistic of previously released inputs. The researchers find a pronounced pattern at the release of this information, and these patterns are more pronounced for high beta stocks, for stocks that are more difficult to arbitrage, and during times when investors' sensitivity to firm-specific stale information is high. Other measures of information arrival, such as price volatility and volume, spike after the data release. The insight for management: Some investors are inattentive to the stale nature of the information included in the LEI releases, instead interpreting it as new information, and thereby causing temporary yet significant mispricing.Market Madness? The Case of Mad Money (p. 351) Joseph Engelberg, Caroline Sasseville, Jared Williams Is there market madness for Mad Money? In the popular television show Mad Money, hosted by Jim Cramer, stock recommendations are regularly made. Does viewing the show pose an opportunity for viewers? Yes\u2014if they act quickly. The authors find that stock recommendations lead to large overnight returns that subsequently reverse over the next few months. The spike-reversal pattern is strongest among small, illiquid stocks that are hard to arbitrage. They also find that the overnight return is strongest when high-income viewership is high. The pattern is also apparent among sell recommendations. The insight for management: Hype sells (there is a potential role of media in generating short-term mispricing), but be quick in order to beat the crowd.Do Cultural Differences Between Contracting Parties Matter? Evidence from Syndicated Bank Loans (p. 365) Mariassunta Giannetti, Yishay Yafeh Do cultural differences between contracting parties matter? For example, do banking terms depend on how similar the parties are? The authors examine a large data set of international syndicated bank loans and find that more culturally distant lead banks offer borrowers smaller loans at a higher interest rate and are more likely to require third-party guarantees. The authors show that the differences are big: Minor differences in cultures, such as between Canada and the United States or between Japan and South Korea, are associated with a 6.5-basis-point-higher loan spread. The loan spread increases by approximately 23 basis points if the bank-firm match involves culturally more different countries, for example, from Japan and the United States. The authors suggest that familiarity is not enough; these effects do not disappear after repeated interaction between borrower and lender. The insight for management: Tolerance for cultural diversity can allow an organization expanded business opportunities and profits.Bubbles and Information: An Experiment (p. 384) Matthias Sutter, J\u00fcrgen Huber, Michael Kirchler Ubiquitous information creates market efficiency, right? Speculative bubbles are inefficient, right? So then information should remedy bubbles, but these authors suggest that just the opposite can be true. Although uninformed traders are subject to the bubble phenomenon, so are symmetrically informed traders. The authors find that markets with asymmetrically informed traders have significantly smaller bubbles than markets with symmetrically informed or uninformed traders. Hence, fundamental values are better reflected in market prices\u2014implying higher market efficiency\u2014when some traders know more than others about future dividends. This suggests that bubbles are abated when traders know that a subset of them have an edge (in information) over others. The insight for management: Information is good for market efficiency, but asymmetric information is better.A Transaction-Level Analysis of Spatial Arbitrage: The Role of Habit, Attention, and Electronic Trading (p. 394) Eric Overby, Jonathan Clarke Arbitrage creates market efficiency. But what creates arbitrage opportunities? There is limited evidence of the factors that create and eliminate arbitrage opportunities, how often arbitrage occurs, and how profitable it is. The authors evaluate spatial arbitrage in the wholesale automotive market by analyzing how sellers choose where to sell vehicles. They find that the attention that sellers pay to the distribution of a vehicle is negatively related to the probability that it is arbitraged. Arbitrage occurs in approximately 1% of transactions, although electronic trading is making arbitrage less prevalent by improving buyer/seller matching across locations. Arbitrage yields a 5.6% return on average, although arbitrageurs take a loss 14% of the time. The insight for management: Focusing on contributors to arbitrage opportunities can lead to increased profits.Penny Wise, Dollar Foolish: Buy\u2013Sell Imbalances On and Around Round Numbers (p. 413) Utpal Bhattacharya, Craig W. Holden, Stacey Jacobsen Can traders be penny wise because others are dollar foolish? The answer is yes: Stock traders fixate on whole numbers as trading focal points. The authors examine more than 100 million stock transactions and find excess buying price points one penny below round numbers. Similarly, they find excess selling one penny above round numbers. The effect is biggest at even dollar amounts, then 50-cent markers, and so on. Simply put, the buy and sell orders tend to be at focal points. The insight for management: Focal point buying and selling can be costly; buying (selling) by liquidity demanders below (above) round numbers yields losses approaching $1 billion per year.Initial Public Offerings as Lotteries: Skewness Preference and First-Day Returns (p. 432) T. Clifton Green, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang Is getting in on a hot IPO like winning the lottery? The authors find that initial public offerings (IPOs) with high expected skewness experience significantly greater first-day returns. The skewness effect is stronger during periods of high investor sentiment and is related to differences in skewness across industries as well as to time-series variation in the level of skewness in the market. However, IPOs come back to earth; IPOs with high expected skewness earn more negative abnormal returns in the following one to five years. High expected skewness is also associated with a higher fraction of small-sized trades on the first day of trading, which is consistent with a greater shift in holdings from institutions to individuals. The insight for management: The results suggest that first-day IPO returns are related to a preference for skewness.Prospect Theory, Liquidation, and the Disposition Effect (p. 445) Vicky Henderson It is a well-known behavioral tendency to evaluate outcomes of decision relative to a benchmark position; the disposition effect is the tendency of investors to sell assets that have risen in value rather than fallen. The researchers extend the literature in their development of a model in which the investor will \u201cgive up\u201d and sell at a loss when the asset has a sufficiently low risk/reward ratio. The insight for management: New decision modeling captures the fact that people hate to sell at a loss but will do so in the case of sufficiently poor future prospects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1514","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['gender', 'boardroom', 'diversity', 'values', 'risk attitudes']","The article discusses gender differences in the boardroom, highlighting how female and male directors differ in core values and risk attitudes, which aligns with DEI themes.

Working within the expected utility framework, we extend the one-switch notion to the multiattribute case and identify the families of multiattribute utility functions that are one-switch. We then show that all multiattribute one-switch utility functions can be approximated by a sum of two multiattribute exponential utilities (sumex utility).

We study this new class of problems, which are costly to specify, pose credibility issues for the focal firm, and require finely tuned awards for meeting the firm's needs. Through an analytical model, we examine the relationship between problem specification, award structure, and breadth of solution space searched by outside agents toward characterizing how a firm should effectively manage such open-ended design contests. Our results independently establish and offer a causal explanation for an interesting phenomenon observed in design contests\u2014clustering of searchers in specific regions of the solution space.

Using the Taylor expansion series of the representative investor's marginal utility, I show that the price of market volatility risk is restricted by the investor's risk aversion and skewness preference. The risk aversion is estimated to be between two and five and is significant. The price of the market volatility is negative. Consistent with economic theory, I find that the pricing kernel decreases in the market index return and increases in market volatility. The projection of the estimated pricing kernel onto a polynomial function of the market return produces puzzling behaviors, which can be observed in the pricing kernel and absolute risk aversion functions. The inclusion of additional terms in the Taylor expansion series of the investor's marginal utility produces a pricing kernel function of market stochastic volatility, stochastic skewness, and stochastic kurtosis. The prices of risk of these moments are restricted by the investor's risk aversion, skewness preference, and kurtosis preference. The prices of risk of these moments should not be confused with the price of risk of powers of the market return, such as coskewness and cokurtosis.

Sampling is used to infer the unknown performance of several alternatives before one alternative is selected as best. This paper presents new economically motivated fully sequential sampling procedures to solve such problems, called economics of selection procedures. The optimal procedure is derived for comparing a known standard with one alternative whose unknown reward is inferred with sampling. That result motivates heuristics when multiple alternatives have unknown rewards. The resulting procedures are more effective in numerical experiments than any previously proposed procedure of which we are aware and are easily implemented. The key driver of the improvement is the use of dynamic programming to model sequential sampling as an option to learn before selecting an alternative.

The parameters of the underlying demand model are initially unknown, so each price decision involves a trade-off between learning and earning. Attention is restricted to the simplest kind of model uncertainty, where one of two demand models is known to apply, and we focus initially on performance of the myopic Bayesian policy (MBP), variants of which are commonly used in practice. Because learning is passive under the MBP (that is, learning only takes place as a by-product of actions that have a different purpose), it can lead to incomplete learning and poor profit performance. However, under one additional assumption, a constrained variant of the myopic policy is shown to have the following strong theoretical virtue: the expected performance gap relative to a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand model is bounded by a constant as the number of sales attempts becomes large.

The argument is that because a leasing firm retains ownership of the off-lease units, it has an incentive to remarket them or invest in designing a more durable product, resulting in a lower volume of new production and disposal. However, leasing might be environmentally inferior because of the direct control the firm has over the off-lease products, which may prompt the firm to remove them from the market to avoid cannibalizing the demand for new products. Motivated by these issues, we adopt a life-cycle environmental impact perspective and analytically investigate if leasing can be both more profitable and have a lower total environmental impact. We find that leasing can be environmentally worse despite remarketing all off-lease products and greener than selling despite the mid-life removal of off-lease products. Our analysis also provides insights for environmental groups and entities that use different approaches to improve the environmental performance of business practices.

Density forecasts of arrival rates are needed for analytical call center models, which assume Poisson arrivals with a stochastic arrival rate. Density forecasts of call volumes can be used in simulation models and are also important for the analysis of outsourcing contracts. A forecasting method, which has previously shown strong potential, is Holt\u2013Winters exponential smoothing adapted for modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles in intraday data. To enable density forecasting of the arrival volume and rate, we develop a Poisson count model, with gamma distributed arrival rate, which captures the essential features of this exponential smoothing method. The apparent stationary level in our data leads us to develop versions of the new model for series with stationary levels. We evaluate forecast accuracy up to two weeks ahead using data from three organizations. We find that the stationary level models improve prediction beyond approximately two days ahead, and that these models perform well in comparison with sophisticated benchmarks. This is confirmed by the results of a call center simulation model, which demonstrates the use of arrival rate density forecasting to support staffing decisions.

Seamans How does government bailout of automotive and financial companies affect competition? Economists have long studied competition between profit maximizing firms. The author investigates how private firms respond to potential entry from public firms. Based on a data set of more than 3,000 U.S. cable TV systems, the author presents evidence consistent with the idea that cable firms actively try to deter entrance by municipal electricity utilities that may be considering offering cable services. Interestingly, the author points to evidence that incumbent cable TV firms upgrade faster when located in markets with a potential municipal entrant. However, it isn't necessarily for the good of its customers; the same systems are then slower to offer new products enabled by the upgrade. Incumbent cable systems also upgrade faster in response to municipal entry threats than to the threat of a private company entering the market. The insight for management: A private firm's response to potential entry from a public firm differs from its response to a threat from a private firm; government participation may spark a quicker and more defensive stance from incumbents.Constant Proportion Debt Obligations: A Postmortem Analysis of Rating Models (p. 476) Michael B. Gordy, S\u00f8ren Willemann A complex financial instrument called the constant proportion debt obligation (CPDO) might be viewed as the poster child for the excesses of financial engineering in the credit market. For example, one of the first CPDOs, ABN AMRO's Surf, was rated AAA by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and earned considerable attention in the financial press and industry awards such as Risk magazine's \u201cDeal of the Year\u201d in February 2007. However, when credit markets came under stress in 2007, CPDOs were among the first to unravel. The authors examine the CPDO as a case study in model risk in the rating of complex structured products. They show that the volatility of CPDOs was itself volatile and that it was common for risk models to underestimate the probability of extreme spread changes. The insight for management: Traditional risk models' estimates of high spread levels were biased downward, which in turn biased the rating upward.Cutting in Line: Social Norms in Queues (p. 493) Gad Allon, Eran Hanany \u201cMay I go in front of you?\u201d is a request often made in a bank or grocery line, followed by \u201cI am in a huge hurry and will only take a second.\u201d How do you respond? The authors explore both the decision to request to \u201ccut\u201d and the decision whether to grant or reject the request. They find that when no \u201cauthority\u201d (e.g., bank manager) is involved, in some cases the answer is yes, in others, no. As it turns out, the eyes boring into the back of the \u201ccutter\u201d might be the best enforcement mechanism to reduce cutting. The insight for management: Your customers might \u201ccut\u201d only in certain situations; social policing may be an alternative to authority policing of customer behavior.Calendar Cycles, Infrequent Decisions, and the Cross Section of Stock Returns (p. 507) Ravi Jagannathan, Srikant Marakani, Hitoshi Takehara, Yong Wang Have you checked your portfolio lately? The prevailing \u201cconsumption-based capital asset pricing model\u201d (CCAPM) suggests that the risk premium that investors require to invest in a financial asset is proportional to the covariance of its return with the growth rate in aggregate per capita consumption, the measure of the security's systematic risk. The authors suggest that this model holds only at those points in time when all investors review their plans. They find more support for this theory at the end of the tax year in both Japan and the United Kingdom, when people are more likely to reevaluate their investment and consumption decisions. The insight for management: The assumption of full information is important for the CCAPM to hold.Is Leasing Greener Than Selling? (p. 523) Vishal V. Agrawal, Mark Ferguson, L.

Taylor How many operators are needed to adequately staff a call center? The key input to the call center staffing decision is a forecast for the number of calls arriving. Typically, density forecasts that are inputs to analytical call center simulation models assume Poisson arrivals with a stochastic arrival rate. Often, Holt\u2013Winters exponential smoothing forecasts adapted for modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles has been used. The author proposes a Poisson count model with a gamma distributed arrival rate forecasting method and tests his forecasting methodology using data from three organizations. The author evaluates forecast accuracy up to two weeks ahead and finds that the proposed models improve prediction beyond two days ahead. The insight for management: Improved forecasting methodologies can improve call center simulations to support staffing decisions.Sequential Sampling with Economics of Selection Procedures (p. 550) Stephen E. Chick, Peter Frazier Stop or shop? Say a manager is investigating a location for a new retail outlet or distribution center, for example. How does he know when to stop or to continue searching when there is great uncertainty of how each location will perform? How can a manager select \u201cbest\u201d alternatives in an environment of future uncertainty of how the alternatives will perform? The authors suggest that \u201ceconomics of selection\u201d procedures help a manager facing a sequential sampling problem in which sampling is used to infer the unknown performance of several alternatives before one is selected as best. The manager compares a known standard with one alternative whose unknown reward is inferred with sampling. The insight for management: Sequential decision heuristics based on economics may account for the expected benefit of alternatives and may allow for adaptive stopping policies, saving time and effort.Bayesian Dynamic Pricing Policies: Learning and Earning Under a Binary Prior Distribution (p. 570) J. Michael Harrison, N. Bora Keskin, Assaf Zeevi Imagine that a bank makes loan decisions to consumers who call in sequentially, observing either success or failure in each sales attempt. Initially, the bank may not know the underlying willingness to pay, so each price decision involves a trade-off between learning (failed sale) and earning (successful sale, but potentially underpriced). Because learning is passive (that is, learning takes place only as a by-product of actions that have a different purpose), incomplete learning and poor long-run profit performance can result. The authors find that, in some cases, a myopic policy can work out. The insight for management: A rather myopic policy under this uncertainty has a bounded performance gap relative to that of perfect information as the number of sales attempts becomes large.Chasing a Moving Target: Exploitation and Exploration in Dynamic Environments (p. 587) Hart E.

The insight for management: Under some conditions the appropriate response to environmental change is a renewed focus on exploiting existing knowledge and opportunities rather than a costly pursuit of new information that may itself be obsolete.Multiattribute One-Switch Utility (p. 602) Ilia Tsetlin, Robert L. Winkler The \u201cone-switch\u201d property states that the preference between any two lotteries switches at most once as wealth increases. The authors extend the one-switch notion to the multiattribute case and identify the families of multiattribute utility functions that are also one-switch. The insight for management: The one-switch property, when appropriate, can simplify the assessment of multiattribute utility.Managing Delegated Search Over Design Spaces (p. 606) Sanjiv Erat, Vish Krishnan Recently, the Swiss-based nongovernmental organization Mabawa posed the Rwanda Rural Electrification Challenge in \u201ctournament\u201d fashion, with the top three solutions splitting $2,500. Would you participate? Such an unstructured problem is costly to specify, poses credibility issues for the focal firm, and requires finely tuned awards for meeting the firm's needs. The firm must go through extensive efforts in these regards to attract participants and useful solutions. The authors suggest how a firm should effectively manage such open-ended design contests by examining the relationship among problem specification, award structure, and breadth of solution space searched by outside agents. The authors explain an interesting phenomenon observed in design contests: clustering of searchers in specific regions of the solution space. Although the breadth of search increases with the number of searchers, the growth of the solution space is slower than the growth of participants. The insight for management: Unstructured contests can be made more effective by carefully choosing how many and what size awards should be offered, as well as the extent to which problems are specified.Pricing Kernels with Stochastic Skewness and Volatility Risk (p. 624) Fousseni Chabi-Yo How are investor utility and stock prices affected by price volatility, and vice versa? A pricing kernel can be interpreted as a scaled marginal utility. The author shows that market volatility risk is not exogenous to investor preferences; it is in fact restricted by the investor's risk aversion and skewness preferences. The author shows that the pricing kernel decreases in the market index return and increases in market volatility. The insight for management: Although often investor utility is considered a function of volatility, in fact market volatility and skewness themselves can be affected by investor preference.Optimal Compensation and Pay-Performance Sensitivity in a Continuous-Time Principal-Agent Model (p. 641) Nengjiu Ju, Xuhu Wan How should compensation be structured between diversified, risk-neutral shareholders and a risk-averse manager? The authors show several interesting results. First, the optimal compensation is increasing but concave in output value if the manager is more risk averse than a log-utility manager; optimally, there is diminishing payout for performance. Second, when the manager has a specific preference form, linear contract is optimal without lower bound on payment, but an option contract is optimal when there is an explicit lower bound. Third, optimal effort of the manager depends on the situation he or she is placed in. The insight for management: Pay schemes should be well designed to invoke the appropriate incentives and returns for both investors and managers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1526","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['government', 'competition', 'private firms']","The article primarily focuses on competition and market dynamics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

In this study we can distinguish whether one mechanism\u2014statistical discrimination\u2014is a primary explanation for racial disparities in physicians' treatment of patients. In a longitudinal natural experiment using repeated quasi-audit studies of medical students, we test for within-cohort changes in disparities from medical student behaviors as they interact with white and black patient actors. We find significant increases in medical students' disparate behaviors by patient race between their first and second years of medical school.

We derive the optimal group composition as a function of predictive accuracy, between- and within-type covariance, and group size.

A pseudo order refers to a tentative customer order whose attributes, such as the likelihood of an actual order, order quantity, and confirmation timing, can change dynamically over time. A unit demand from any class is assembled from one manufactured unit and one inventory unit, where the manufactured unit takes one unit of capacity and needs a single period to produce. An accepted order must be filled before a positive delivery lead time. The underlying order acceptance decisions involve trade-offs between committing resources (production capacity and component inventory) to low-reward firm orders and reserving resources for high-reward orders. We develop a Markov chain model that captures the key characteristics of pseudo orders, including demand lumpiness, nonstationarity, and volatility. We then formulate a stochastic dynamic program for the ATP assembly system that embeds the Markov chain model as a short-term forecast for pseudo orders. We show that the optimal order acceptance policy is characterized by class prioritization, resource-imbalance-based rationing, and capacity-inventory-demand matching. In particular, the rationing level for each class is determined by a critical value that depends on the resource imbalance level, defined as the net difference between the production capacity and component inventory levels. Extensive numerical tests underscore the importance of the key properties of the optimal policy and provide operational and managerial insights on the value of the short-term demand forecast and the robustness of the optimal policy.

Recent theoretical developments have lessened the computational complexity of these auctions, but the issue of cognitive complexity remains an unexplored barrier for the online marketplace. This study uses a data-driven approach to explore how bidders react to the complexity in such auctions using three experimental feedback treatments. Using cluster analyses of the bids and the clicks generated by bidders, we find three stable bidder strategies across the three treatments. Further, these strategies are robust for separate experiments using a different setup. We also benchmark the continuous auctions against an iterative form of combinatorial auction\u2014the combinatorial clock auction. The enumeration of the bidding strategies across different types of feedback, along with the analysis of their economic implications, is offered to help practitioners design better combinatorial auction environments.

It finds that relative scarcity may not always benefit resource sellers. Rather, when competition among resource investors passes a certain threshold intensity, miscoordination among investors increases to the point that sellers' expected profits decline. This paper extends the model to consider how investors organize to overcome managerial agency in resource evaluation. Two organizational designs are considered: (a) incentivization, wherein a lower-level manager is motivated by an incentive contract to evaluate resources for an investor, and (b) supervision, wherein evaluation is either handled directly or closely monitored by headquarters. The model suggests that competition among investors will be associated with a greater use of supervision and that investors using supervision will tend to make lower offers. This paper also finds that supervision will be more common when valuable resources are rare.

The analysis is based on the theory that occupations involving tasks that are \u201ctradable,\u201d such as tasks that require little personal communication or hands-on interaction with U.S.-based objects, are vulnerable to being moved offshore. Consistent with this theory, we find that firms that have offshore IT captive centers have 8% less of their onshore IT workforce involved in tradable occupations; those without offshore captive centers have increased the proportion of onshore employment in these same occupations by 3%. In addition, we find that hourly IT workers (e.g., IT contractors) are disproportionately employed in tradable jobs, and their onshore employment is 2%\u20133% lower in firms with offshore captive centers. These findings persist after considering different measures of employment composition, including controls for human capital, firm performance, domestic outsourcing, and whether firms choose to build or buy software.

Explanations for geographic variation in the efficacy of different customer acquisition methods including traditional methods of offline word-of-mouth (WOM) and magazine advertising and information systems (IS)-enabled methods of online WOM and online search remain unexplored. We estimate a multivariate negative binomial distribution (NBD) model on zip code\u2013level customer counts from a leading Internet retailer and provide new insights into factors explaining geographic variation in the success of these methods. First, we show that target customer density explains geographic variation over and above the impact due to the number of potential customers. Moreover, the effect of density is greatest for offline and online WOM acquisitions; this suggests that density contributes to contagion, connectivity, and a hypothesized \u201csocial multiplier.\u201d Second, when senders and recipients of WOM share consumption benefits, WOM is more powerful and compelling. We find that location-based convenience benefits have stronger effects on location-dependent offline WOM acquisitions than on location-independent online WOM acquisitions. Third, acquisition channels contribute differently to the total customer pool\u2014offline WOM acquisitions are clustered, whereas magazine acquisitions are dispersed.

The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed to reduced complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of specialized expertise; the benefits of greater breadth are linked to the economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as advertising or production capacity, across activities. Within the literature on corporate strategy, this tension between focus and breadth is reconciled by the concept of related diversification (i.e., a firm with multiple operating units, each specializing in distinct but related activities). We consider whether there are similar benefits to related diversification within an operating unit and examine the mechanism that generates these benefits. Using the empirical context of cardiovascular care within hospitals, we first examine the relationship between a hospital's level of specialization in cardiovascular care and the quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients. We find that, on average, focus has a positive effect on quality performance. We then distinguish between positive spillovers and complementarities to examine (1) the extent to which a hospital's specialization in areas related to cardiovascular care directly impacts performance on cardiovascular patients (positive spillovers) and (2) whether the marginal benefit of a hospital's focus in cardiovascular care depends on the degree to which the hospital \u201ccospecializes\u201d in related areas (complementarities).

Our empirical analysis of the global semiconductor industry shows that industry leaders intensify internal linkages across locations when they collocate with direct market competitors, but not when they collocate with innovators in the same technological field.

(p. 696) Monic Sun Most people like a bestseller; a high average rating indicates high product quality. But do books sales suffer if some readers hate a book while others love it? The author examines the informational role of product ratings and finds that a high variance of product ratings is associated with a niche product, one that appeals a great deal to a small set of customers. So, interestingly, a higher variance would correspond to a higher subsequent demand if and only if the average rating is low. The author finds support for the niche hypothesis using book data from Amazon.com and BN.com. A higher standard deviation of ratings on Amazon improves a book's relative sales rank when the average rating is lower than 4.1 stars, which is true for 35% of all the books in the sample.

Clark, Robert S. Huckman Should a firm specialize to create more efficient operations or diversify to reduce product risk? The long-standing argument that focused operations outperform others stands in contrast to claims about the benefits of broader operational scope. The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed to reduced complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of specialized expertise. On the other hand, the benefits of greater product breadth are linked to the economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as advertising or production capacity, across activities. This disagreement leads to a tension between focus and breadth in corporate products. The conflict can be reconciled by the concept of \u201crelated diversification\u201d (i.e., a firm with multiple operating units, each specializing in distinct but related activities). The authors test these approaches by studying cardiovascular care within hospitals. They examine the relationship between a hospital's level of specialization in cardiovascular care and the quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients and find that focus has a positive effect on quality performance. But they then look at the hospital's specialization in areas related to cardiovascular care to see whether \u201cpositive spillovers\u201d help performance with cardiovascular patients through \u201ccospecialization\u201d in related areas (complementarities). The insight for management: Specialization may contribute to product quality, but too much specialization might limit opportunities to learn best practices and synergies with related products.White Lies (p. 723) Sanjiv Erat, Uri Gneezy \u201cIt's just a little white lie; it's for the best.\u201d This sounds innocent enough, but who is helped by a white lie, and who is hurt? The authors analyze two types of white lies: those that help others at the expense of the person telling the lie, which the authors term \u201caltruistic white lies,\u201d and those that help both others and the liar, which they term \u201cPareto white lies.\u201d Of course, from a total cost perspective, Pareto white lies are more efficient because they help both parties. However, the authors find that a large fraction of participants are reluctant to tell a Pareto white lie, demonstrating a pure lie aversion independent of any social preferences for outcomes. Paradoxically, a nonnegligible fraction of participants are willing to tell an altruistic white lie even though it hurts them a bit but significantly helps others. In line with previous findings, women are less likely to lie when it is costly to the other side, but, interestingly, the authors find that women are more likely to tell an altruistic lie. The insight for management: While many people avoid lies even if they can help all parties, some people are more likely to lie at their own expense to help the other party.Local R&D Strategies and Multilocation Firms: The Role of Internal Linkages (p. 734) Juan Alc\u00e1cer, Minyuan Zhao How should geographically dispersed research centers in a firm share information?

Moreover, the effect of density is greatest for offline and online word-of-mouth acquisitions; this finding suggests that density contributes to the \u201cbandwagon\u201d effect. They find also that word of mouth is most effective when senders and recipients share consumption benefits. Finally, they show that acquisition channels contribute differently to the total customer pool\u2014offline word-of-mouth acquisitions are clustered, whereas magazine acquisitions are dispersed. The insight for management: Using a new approach to target specific online markets could deliver a twofold improvement in actual click-to-order rates.Managing an Available-to-Promise Assembly System with Dynamic Short-Term Pseudo-Order Forecast (p. 770) Long Gao, Susan H. Xu, Michael O. Ball How should firms reserve capacity to achieve service goals for future orders when those orders are highly uncertain? A \u201cpseudo order\u201d refers to a tentative customer order whose attributes, such as the likelihood of an actual order, order quantity, and confirmation timing, can change dynamically over time. Accepting a pseudo order involves trade-offs between committing resources (production capacity and component inventory) to nonbinding orders and reserving resources for high-profit orders. The authors show that the optimal order-acceptance policy requires prioritization of orders, rationing based on resource imbalances, and matching available capacity and inventory to demand. The insight for management: The net difference between the production capacity and component inventory levels relative to the short-term forecast is critical to making optimal order acceptance decisions.On Evaluation Costs in Strategic Factor Markets: The Implications for Competition and Organizational Design (p. 791) David Gaddis Ross \u201cIt's a seller's market\u201d is the claim of investors who can't buy strategic factors economically. But if evaluation costs are high, the author suggests that relative scarcity may not always benefit sellers. If competition grows past a certain point, miscoordination among buyers increases to the point that sellers' expected profits decline. The author suggests two ways in which investors might organize to overcome managerial errors in resource evaluation. The first is incentivization, wherein a lower-level manager is motivated by an incentive contract to evaluate resources for an investor. The second is supervision, wherein evaluation either is handled directly or is closely monitored by headquarters. The insight for management: Competition among investors when valuable resources are rare creates an organization with centralized supervision, which leads to lower offers.Optimal Forecasting Groups (p. 805) P. J. Lamberson, Scott E. Page What are the optimal composition and group size of a group for making a combined forecast? The authors suggest that it depends on a factor called \u201ccoherence\u201d of the group, which is a function of the accuracy and covariance of forecasters in the group. The insight for management: Group size plays a critical role in determining the optimal group; in small groups the most accurate type should be in the majority, whereas in large groups the type with the least within-type covariance should dominate.Effect of Information Feedback on Bidder Behavior in Continuous Combinatorial Auctions (p. 811) Gediminas Adomavicius, Shawn P. Curley, Alok Gupta, Pallab Sanyal Recent theoretical advances have shown that combinatorial auctions\u2014in which bidders can bid on combinations of goods\u2014can increase the economic efficiency of a trade when goods have complementarities. But if the products being offered are complex, does that hamper the ability of bidders to evaluate the bundles and thus reduce their willingness to bid? The authors evaluate online continuous auctions and combinatorial clock auctions with different feedback mechanisms. For example, participants might be given no feedback, feedback on the winning bid, or feedback on winning prices. In each case, participant behaviors change based on the information made available to them. The insight for management: Information feedback to bidders may help sellers design better combinatorial auction environments.Probability and Time Trade-Off (p. 831) Manel Baucells, Franz H. Heukamp Should a decision maker make a decision now or wait for better information to reduce uncertainty? Probability and time are integral dimensions of virtually any decision. The authors consider the prospect of receiving a certain outcome with some uncertainty at some time. The authors examine trade-offs over risk and time and describe how these might be perceived psychologically by the decision maker. The insight for management: Time, uncertainty, and psychology all enter into the decision maker's calculus of a decision.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1556","","MS","Multidisciplinary","7","['discrimination', 'racial disparities', 'patient care', 'altruistic white lies']","The article addresses themes of discrimination and racial disparities in healthcare, indicating a strong focus on social justice and ethical considerations in management practices.

In this paper, we investigate how pricing strategies based on customer cost information affects a firm's customer acquisition and retention dynamics, and ultimately its profit, using a two-period monopoly model with high- and low-cost customer segments. Although past purchase and cost information helps firms to increase profits through differential prices for good and bad customers in the second period (\u201cprice discrimination effect\u201d), it can hurt firms because strategic forward-looking consumers may delay purchases to avoid higher future prices (\u201cratchet effect\u201d). We find that when the customer cost heterogeneity is sufficiently large, it is optimal for firms to \u201cfire\u201d some of its high-cost customers, and customer cost-based pricing is profitable. Surprisingly, it is optimal to fire even some profitable customers. This result is robust even when the cost to serve is endogenous and determined by the consumer's choice of service level. We also shed insight on acquisition\u2013retention dynamics, on when firms can improve their profitability by selectively firing known old \u201cbad\u201d customers, and on replacing the old \u201cbad\u201d customers with a mix of new \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d customers.

The product may have high or low quality, and consumers are heterogeneously informed. The firm chooses a slow or (at a cost) a fast service rate. In equilibrium, informed consumers join the queue if it is below a threshold. The threshold varies with the quality of the good, so an uninformed consumer updates her belief about quality on observing the length of the queue. The strategy of an uninformed consumer has a \u201chole\u201d: she joins the queue at lengths both below and above the hole, but not at the hole itself. We show that if the prior probability the product has high quality and the proportion of informed consumers are both low, a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a low-quality firm. The queue can therefore be a valuable signaling device for a high-quality firm. Strikingly, in some scenarios, the high-quality firm may choose the slow service rate even if the technological cost of speeding up is zero.

For original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in this industry, the importance of secondary markets has grown in parallel, not only as a source of revenue, but also because of their impact on these firms' competitive advantage and market strategy. Recent articles in the press have severely criticized some OEMs who are perceived to be actively trying to eliminate the secondary market for their products. Other OEMs have policies that enhance their secondary markets. The goal of this paper is to understand how an OEM's incentives and optimal strategies vis-\u00e0-vis the secondary market are shaped contingent on her relative competitive advantage, product characteristics, and consumer preferences. The critical trade-off that we examine is whether the indirect benefit from maintaining an active secondary market (the resale value effect) can outweigh the potentially negative effect of the sales of used products at the expense of new product sales (the cannibalization effect). To that end, we develop a durable good model where the OEM can directly affect the resale value of her product through a relicensing fee charged to the buyer of the refurbished equipment. We analyze the OEM's strategy in both the monopoly and the duopoly cases, characterize the optimal relicensing fee set by the OEM, and draw conclusions on the conditions that favor stimulating or deterring the secondary market.

We use a unique panel data set that tracks the funding dynamics of borrower listings on Prosper.com, the largest microloan market in the United States. We find evidence of rational herding among lenders. Well-funded borrower listings tend to attract more funding after we control for unobserved listing heterogeneity and payoff externalities. Moreover, instead of passively mimicking their peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational learning (rational herding); they infer the creditworthiness of borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences. Counterintuitively, obvious defects (e.g., poor credit grades) amplify a listing's herding momentum, as lenders infer superior creditworthiness to justify the herd. Similarly, favorable borrower characteristics (e.g., friend endorsements) weaken the herding effect, as lenders attribute herding to these observable merits. Follow-up analysis shows that rational herding beats irrational herding in predicting loan performance.

We assess our model by combining fine-grained data on human capital management (HCM) software adoption over 11 years with detailed survey data on incentive systems and HR analytics practices for 189 firms. We find that the adoption of HCM software is greatest in firms that have also adopted performance pay and HR analytics practices. Furthermore, HCM adoption is associated with a large productivity premium when it is implemented as a system of organizational incentives, but has less benefit when adopted in isolation. The system of three-way complements produces disproportionately greater benefits than pairwise interactions, highlighting the importance of including all three complements.

Out of six data sets, the G/G/NBD model provides a notable improvement in the log-likelihood over the Pareto/NBD model in four data sets. It can indicate substantial differences in expected residual lifetimes compared to the Pareto/NBD and induce a retention rather than acquisition policy.

Focusing on relationships between suppliers and their organizational buyers, we augment this perspective by positing that relationship outcomes are also influenced by social comparison processes involving perceptions of a supplier's practices across comparable buyer relationships. Based on past research on embedded ties and institutional theory, we propose that the effect of these comparison processes depends on the nature of a buyer's existing interorganizational ties and on the norms that are brought to bear on the relationship in question. We test our propositions based on 788 observations of organizational buyers who have relationships with the same supplier.

This paper examines the dynamic properties of the rate-of-return regulation process when the regulated firm periodically undertakes new capacity investments. Our analysis identifies prices that correspond to stationary values of the regulation process. It is shown that the underlying depreciation rules for property, plant, and equipment determine whether these stationary prices will be above, equal to, or below the long-run marginal cost of providing the regulated service. We provide conditions under which the rate-of-return regulation process is dynamically stable so that prices indeed converge to their stationary values.

Hitt, Erik Brynjolfsson When it comes to technology, should firms focus on their internal core capabilities or on threats and opportunities in their external environment? The authors suggest that an external focus\u2014which enables a firm to detect and therefore respond to changes in its external operating environment\u2014increases returns to information technology (IT). They gathered detailed data on organizational practices and IT use at 253 firms to examine the hypothesis that an external focus might help the returns to IT. They find that an external focus and decentralized decision making enhance both IT innovation and productivity, which in turn enhance returns to IT investment. The insight for management: Firms that operate in information-rich environments such as high-technology clusters or areas with high worker mobility are likely to achieve higher returns on IT investment.Information Transmission and the Bullwhip Effect: An Empirical Investigation (p. 860) Robert L. Bray, Haim Mendelson Is the bullwhip effect real, and, if so, how large and pervasive is it? The bullwhip effect is the amplification of demand variability along a supply chain; a company bullwhips if it purchases from suppliers more variably than it sells to customers. Such bullwhips (amplifications of demand variability) can lead to mismatches between demand and production and hence to lower supply chain efficiency. The authors search for the bullwhip effect in a sample of 4,689 public U.S. companies over 1974\u20132008. Overall, from 1974\u20131994 to 1995\u20132008, they find that mean bullwhip has dropped by a third, but still approximately two-thirds of firms bullwhip. The sample's mean and median bullwhips measure 15.8% and 6.7% of total demand variability. Put another way, the mean quarterly standard deviation of upstream orders exceeds that of demand by $20 million. The authors find differing levels of bullwhip based on planned and unplanned deviations, seasonality effects, and the lead time between when deviations are realized and when they are experienced. Bullwhip is greater when less lead time is given. The authors find that advanced information dampens the bullwhip effect. Firms with more than three-quarters' notice contribute 30% of the bullwhip, but those with less than one-quarter's notice drive 51% of the bullwhip. The insight for management: Practices such as \u201corder freeze periods\u201d (where planned orders do not vary from actual in the near term) may reduce bullwhip.Signaling Quality via Queues (p. 876) Laurens G.

The authors evaluate behaviors of impatient consumers who observe the length of the queue before deciding whether to buy a product. The product may have high or low quality, and consumers glean information from the queue, which may grow longer as a function of two factors: high product quality or low service rates. Consumers join the queue if the line is short enough to satisfy them. Interestingly, they might join a longer queue if they infer something about the product quality based on the queue length. The authors suggest that this strategy of an uninformed consumer has a \u201chole,\u201d joining at queue lengths both below and above the hole, but not at the hole itself. The insight for management: Designed scarcity might pay off; a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a low-quality firm in order to signal higher quality, even if the cost of faster service is negligible.Rational Herding in Microloan Markets (p. 892) Juanjuan Zhang, Peng Liu On Prosper.com, the largest microloan market in the United States, individual borrowers raise funding from multiple individual lenders. Often, lenders seem to follow a herd instinct; that is, they tend toward the same borrowers in droves. Is this behavior rational? The authors study data from Prosper.com to evaluate whether lenders are irrational and simply \u201cfollow the herd\u201d or whether this herding mentality is more an example of lenders acting rationally in their herding, as they interpret other lenders' willingness to lend as a signal of the borrower's creditworthiness. The authors find that, instead of passively mimicking their peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational learning (rational herding); the lenders infer the creditworthiness of borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences. This is true even in the face of obvious borrower defects such as poor credit grades. Other signals, such as endorsements, reduce herding by providing an alternative for herding-based inference. The insight for management: Lenders engage in rational herding in microloan markets even if it leads to poor lending decisions; microloan markets can be maneuvered by recognizing herding behavior.Three-Way Complementarities: Performance Pay, Human Resource Analytics, and Information Technology (p. 913) Sinan Aral, Erik Brynjolfsson, Lynn Wu What is the connection among information technology (IT), performance pay, and human resource (HR) analytics practices? The authors develop a model examining how these practices work together as an incentive system that produces a larger productivity premium when the practices are implemented in concert rather than separately. The model is measured through the combination of detailed data from 189 firms on human capital management (HCM) software adoption over 11 years with detailed survey data on incentive systems and HR analytics practices. They find that the adoption of HCM software is greatest in firms that have also adopted performance pay and HR analytics practices. Furthermore, HCM adoption is associated with a large productivity premium when it is implemented as a system of organizational incentives, but it has less benefit when adopted in isolation. The authors note that productivity increases significantly when the HCM systems \u201cgo live\u201d but not when they are purchased, which can be years earlier. The insight for management: IT investment, performance pay, and HR analytics are a powerful combination to increase productivity\u2014much more so in combination than in isolation.When to \u201cFire\u201d Customers: Customer Cost-Based Pricing (p. 932) Jiwoong Shin, K. Sudhir, Dae-Hee Yoon When is customer retention just not worth the effort and cost? The widespread adoption of activity-based costing enables firms to allocate common service costs to each customer, allowing for precise measurement of both the cost to serve a particular customer and the customer's profitability. The authors investigate how pricing strategies based on customer cost information affect a firm's customer acquisition and retention dynamics\u2014and ultimately its profit. Although past purchase and cost information helps firms to increase profits through differential prices for good and bad customers, it can hurt firms because strategic forward-looking consumers may delay purchases to avoid higher future prices. As a result, the authors suggest that when cost differentials are high enough, it is better for firms to \u201cfire\u201d some high-cost customers; surprisingly, it is optimal to fire even some profitable customers. The insight for management: Retention is not always preferable to customer churn; firms can improve their profitability by selectively firing known old bad customers and intentionally replacing them with a new set of customers \u2014 both good and bad.Competition Between Organizational Groups: Its Impact on Altruistic and Antisocial Motivations (p. 948) Lorenz Goette, David Huffman, Stephan Meier, Matthias Sutter Is competition creative or destructive? Economist Joseph Shumpeter coined the popular phrase \u201ccreative destruction\u201d; sometimes competition creates something that destroys something else. Similarly, firms are often organized into groups that might compete. Group membership has been shown empirically to have positive effects in the form of increased prosocial behavior toward in-group members. This includes an enhanced willingness to engage in altruistic punishment of inefficient defection. The authors show a dark side of group membership when tested empirically in Swiss Army platoons. They find that when there is competition between groups, a taste for harming the out-group emerges that might tend more toward negative punishment than toward increased creativity and productivity. The authors give an explanation of previous mixed results on the social value of punishment. The insight for management: Competition within firms is as Joseph Shumpeter intuited between firms; competition enhances within-group efficiency but also generates costly between-group conflict.Impact of Performance-Based Contracting on Product Reliability: An Empirical Analysis (p. 961) Jose A. Guajardo, Morris A. Cohen, Sang-Hyun Kim, Serguei Netessine Which is better, time and material contracts (T&MC) or performance-based contracts (PBC)? PBC, in which the buyer pays for some performance over time of an asset (say, availability time), has been heralded as better aligning buyer and seller incentives, as opposed to T&MC, which might give the seller incentive to overperform profitable maintenance when providing service after the sale. Based on data from a major manufacturer of aircraft engines, the authors find evidence of a positive and significant effect of PBC on product reliability as measured by time between unplanned outages. They find that product reliability is higher by 25%\u201340% under PBC compared with T&MC, even after controlling for the inherent tendency of firms to lean toward one contract or the other. The insight for management: PBC improves reliability through more frequent scheduled maintenance and better care performed in each maintenance event.Dynamics of Rate-of-Return Regulation (p. 980) Alexander Nezlobin, Madhav V. Rajan, Stefan Reichelstein How do regulation and depreciation affect the price of an asset? Under rate-of-return regulation, a firm's product prices are constrained by the requirement that investors not earn more than an allowable return on the firm's assets. The authors show that underlying depreciation rules for property, plant, and equipment determine whether these stationary prices will be above, equal to, or below the long-run marginal cost of providing the regulated service. The insight for management: The efficiency of rate-of-return regulation depends on how well the applicable depreciation schedule matches the productivity pattern of the assets in use.Consistency Judgments, Embeddedness, and Relationship Outcomes in Interorganizational Networks (p. 996) Alberto Sa Vinhas, Jan B. Heide, Sandy D. Jap How are buyer/seller relationships influenced? The authors examine 788 buyers of a single supplier to understand the complex, multilevel picture of the process by which relationship outcomes come about in interorganizational networks. They propose that the effect of these comparison processes depends on the nature of a buyer's existing interorganizational ties and on the norms that are brought to bear on the buyer/seller relationship. The insight for management: Buyer/seller relationships are formed based on a number of factors, including the characteristics of the relationship and the buyer/seller processes. Modeling Purchasing Behavior with Sudden \u201cDeath\u201d: A Flexible Customer Lifetime Model (p. 1012) Albert C. Bemmaor, Nicolas Glady What is the lifetime value of a customer? Of course, this depends on customer purchase size, frequency, and retention. Typically, customer lifetime has been approximated with the \u201cPareto negative binomial distribution.\u201d The authors provide a new customer lifetime model, the gamma/Gompertz distribution. The advantage of this model over the Pareto distribution is twofold in its ability to accurately describe customer retention: (i) its probability density function can exhibit a mode at zero or an interior mode, and (ii) it can be skewed to the right or to the left. Of six data sets, the G/G/NBD model provides a notable improvement in predictive ability over the Pareto/NBD model in four data sets. The insight for management: A new model for estimating customer lifetime has been developed to help better predict the lifetime value of a customer.Relicensing as a Secondary Market Strategy (p. 1022) Nektarios Oraiopoulos, Mark E. Ferguson, L. Beril Toktay Does the indirect benefit of maintaining an active secondary market outweigh the potentially negative effect of the sales of used products at the expense of new product sales? On one hand, an active secondary market enhances resale value of an asset and improves new product value by reducing risk; on the other hand, secondary markets can cannibalize new product sales. Secondary markets in the information technology industry, where used or refurbished equipment is traded, have been growing steadily. For original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in this industry, the importance of secondary markets has grown in parallel, not only as a source of revenue, but also because of their impact on these firms' competitive advantage and market strategy. Some OEMs like Sun Microsystems and Cisco seem to be actively trying to eliminate the secondary market for their products through high relicensing fees. Other OEMs such as IBM and Hewlett Packard have policies that enhance their secondary markets through lower relicensing fees. Which strategy is optimal depends on key trade-offs between the two markets. The insight for management: Optimal OEM relicensing fees can derive maximal profitability from the primary and secondary markets of durable goods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1567","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['innovation', 'productivity', 'organizational practices']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of organizational practices and IT use, with an emphasis on productivity and innovation rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

Previous economic studies, focusing on demand side, find that the equilibrium demand is always less than the socially optimal demand because self-interested individuals do not internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced infectiousness (positive externality). In contrast, we show that the equilibrium demand can be greater than the socially optimal demand after accounting for the limited supply due to yield uncertainty and manufacturer's incentives. The main driver for this result is a second (negative) externality: Self-interested individuals ignore that vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the society when supply is limited. We show that the extent of the negative externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms. To investigate the relative effectiveness of government interventions on supply and demand sides under various demand and supply characteristics, we construct two partially centralized scenarios where the social planner (i.e., government) intervenes either on the demand side or the supply side, but not both. We conduct an extensive numerical analysis.

To develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which scientists influence the productivity of others, I expand the traditional taxonomy of scientists that focuses solely on productivity and add a second, social dimension: helpfulness to others. Using a combination of academic paper publications and citations to capture scientist productivity and the receipt of academic paper acknowledgments to measure helpfulness, I examine the change in publishing output of the coauthors of 149 scientists that die. Coauthors of highly helpful scientists that die experience a decrease in output quality but not output quantity. Meanwhile, the deaths of high productivity scientists that are not highly helpful do not influence their coauthors' output. In addition, scientists who are helpful with conceptual feedback (critique and advice) have a larger impact on the performance of their coauthors than scientists who provide help with material access, scientific tools, or technical work.

To design an optimal payment system that incorporates these features, we develop an empirical method to estimate the structural parameters of the principal\u2013agent model underlying Medicare's dialysis payment system. We use the model and parameter estimates to answer the following questions: Can a pay-for-compliance system based only on the intermediate performance measures currently identified by Medicare achieve first-best? How should patient outcomes be risk adjusted, and what welfare gains can be achieved by doing so? Our main findings are as follows: (1) the current set of intermediate measures identified by Medicare are not comprehensive enough for use alone in a pay-for-compliance system; (2) paying for risk-adjusted downstream outcomes instead of raw downstream outcomes can lengthen the hospital-free life of admitted patients by two weeks per patient per year without increasing Medicare expenditures.

Advance purchases trigger action regret if valuations turn out to be lower than the price paid, whereas delaying purchase may cause inaction regret from missing a discount or facing a stockout. Consumers whom we describe as emotionally rational act strategically in response to the firm's policies and in anticipation of regret. In this context, regret explains two types of behavioral patterns: inertia (delayed purchase) and frenzies (buying early at negative surplus). We show how firms should optimally respond to consumer regret and also characterize a normative regret threshold above which they should not advance sell. Action regret reduces profits as well as the value of advance selling and booking limit policies for price-setting firms; inaction regret has the opposite effects. These effects are diminished by capacity constraints and are reversed for firms facing price pressure in the advance period (owing, e.g., to competition or market heterogeneity). Regret heterogeneity explains premium advance selling for the capacity-constrained firm, which may benefit from larger shares of regretful buyers. Finally, we show how the negative effects of regret on profits can be mitigated by regret-priming marketing campaigns and by offering refunds or options or allowing resales. Our results highlight the importance of assessing the relative strength of regret within and across market segments and of accounting for these factors in pricing and marketing policies.

Such pay-per-action (PPA) mechanisms are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call, and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto unrecognized, side effect of PPA advertising. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, PPA mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upward) relative to prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under pay-per-exposure methods. Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher\u2013advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current auction-based PPA mechanisms, such as the ones used by Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft. In the latter settings they also reduce publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods. I show that these phenomena constitute a form of double marginalization and discuss a number of enhancements to today's PPA mechanisms that restore equilibrium pricing of advertised goods to efficient levels, improving both consumer surplus as well as the publisher's expected profits.

One fundamental question yet to be addressed is whether upstream suppliers' cost efficiency is always beneficial to downstream manufacturers in the presence of competition and negotiations. In other words, does low cost outsourcing always lead to a win\u2013win outcome? To answer this question, we adopt a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to investigate competing manufacturers' sourcing decisions. We analyze two supply chain structures: one-to-one channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to an exclusive supplier; and one-to-two channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to a common supplier. We show that, under both structures, low cost outsourcing may lead to a win\u2013lose outcome in which the suppliers gain and the manufacturers lose. This happens because suppliers' cost advantage may backfire on competing manufacturers through two negative effects. First, a decrease of upstream cost weakens a manufacturer's bargaining position by reducing her disagreement payoff (i.e., her insourcing profit) because the competing manufacturer can obtain a low cost position through outsourcing. Second, in one-to-two channels, the common supplier's bargaining position is strengthened with a lower cost because his disagreement payoff increases (i.e., his profit from serving only one manufacturer increases). The endogeneity of disagreement payoffs in our model highlights the importance of modeling firm negotiations under competition. Moreover, we identify an interesting bargaining externality between competing manufacturers when they outsource to a common supplier. Because the supplier engages in two negotiations, his share of profit from the trade with one manufacturer affects the total surplus of the trade with the other manufacturer. Because of this externality, surprisingly, as a manufacturer's bargaining power decreases, her profit under outsourcing may increase and it may be more likely for her to outsource.

In this paper, we investigate how these two strategies may bring different productivity benefits over time. For our empirical analyses, we use two and a half years of transaction data from a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line. We find that over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety, is related to improved worker productivity. However, when we examine workers' experience across a number of days, we find that variety helps improve worker productivity. Additionally, we show that part of this benefit results from workers' cumulative experience with changeovers.

Success is more likely where connections are strong and run deep.Consumption Externality and Yield Uncertainty in the Influenza Vaccine Supply Chain: Interventions in Demand and Supply Sides (p. 1072) Kenan Arifo\u011flu, Sarang Deo, Seyed M. R. Iravani How can influenza vaccines be more widely taken to improve public health? Typically, the demand for such vaccinations is lower than socially optimal because individuals do not internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced infectiousness (known as a positive externality). The authors show that the supply side can also be found at fault; there is typically limited supply due to yield uncertainty and manufacturer's incentives. This shortage leads to a negative externality; self-interested individuals ignore that vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the society when supply is limited. The authors show that the negative externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms. The insight for management: Administering vaccine distribution has both supply-side and demand-side components; more effective disease control can be achieved though both greater application and smarter allocation.An Evidence-Based Incentive System for Medicare's End-Stage Renal Disease Program (p. 1092) Donald K. K. Lee, Stefanos A. Zenios Recent legislations directed Medicare to revamp its decades-old system for reimbursing dialysis treatments, with a focus on the risk adjustment of payments and on the transition toward a pay-for-compliance system. But questions remain: Can a pay-for-compliance system based only on the intermediate performance measures currently identified by Medicare achieve first-best? How should patient outcomes be risk adjusted, and what welfare gains can be achieved by doing so? The authors find that the current set of intermediate measures identified by Medicare are not comprehensive enough for use alone in a pay-for-compliance system. They suggest that paying for risk-adjusted downstream outcomes instead of raw downstream outcomes can improve healthcare outcomes. The insight for management: Modified Medicare terms could lengthen the hospital-free life of admitted patients by two weeks per patient per year without increasing Medicare expenditures.Organizational Structure and the Limits of Knowledge Sharing: Incentive Conflict and Agency in Car Leasing (p. 1106) Lamar Pierce Can conflicting incentives among managers impede potential knowledge-sharing benefits from vertical integration? The author studies behaviors in the car leasing market, where manufacturer-owned captive lessors compete with independent lessors. In order to be profitable, both organizational forms must acquire and integrate diffuse knowledge to accurately predict vehicle depreciation. Using a data set of 180,000 leases, the author compares contracts of independent and captive lessors across car models, market conditions, and product life cycles. He finds that managers in vertically integrated firms have conflicting incentives on whether to accurately and completely share proprietary knowledge, and he shows that these incentives appear to generate agency costs inconsistent with corporate profitability as managers selectively use and share knowledge for personal gain. The insight for management: Most knowledge benefits of vertical integration will be nullified when managerial interests are incompatible with the profit concerns of the firm.Reconceptualizing Stars: Scientist Helpfulness and Peer Performance (p. 1122) Alexander Oettl Are star researchers to be idolized, or should they thank their lucky stars that they have great colleagues? Innovation is often the result of a communal process; how much of the star's brilliance comes from the constellation around him or her? The author uses a combination of academic paper publications and citations to capture scientist productivity and the receipt of academic paper acknowledgments to measure helpfulness. The author examines the change in publishing output of the coauthors of 149 scientists who have died and finds that coauthors of highly acknowledged scientists who die experience a decrease in output quality but not output quantity. Meanwhile, the deaths of high-productivity scientists who are not highly helpful do not influence their coauthors' output. In addition, scientists who are helpful with conceptual feedback (critique and advice) have a larger impact on the performance of their coauthors than scientists who provide help with material access, scientific tools, or technical work. The insight for management: Within the context of evaluating scientific productivity, it may be time to broaden our conceptualization of a \u201cstar\u201d and rather view entire constellations of researchers.Specialization and Variety in Repetitive Tasks: Evidence from a Japanese Bank (p. 1141) Bradley R. Staats, Francesca Gino What enhances the productivity of employees who conduct repetitive tasks? Does variety of work increase worker satisfaction and motivation, or does specialization of tasks improve throughput? Sustaining operational productivity in the completion of repetitive tasks is critical to many organizations' success. On one hand, specialization to capture the benefits of repetition and variety (i.e., working on different tasks) can keep workers motivated and provide them opportunities to learn. On the other hand, repetition creates efficiency by increasing mastery of one task, improving expertise, and reducing rework. The authors use two and a half years of transaction data from a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line and find that, over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety, is related to improved worker productivity. However, when they examine workers' experience across a number of days, they find that variety helps improve worker productivity. The insight for management: Organizations should transform specialization and variety into mutually reinforcing strategies instead of treating them as mutually exclusive.Advance Selling When Consumers Regret (p. 1160) Javad Nasiry, Ioana Popescu How should firms position products when consumers have uncertain valuations and could regret the purchase? Consumers who make advance purchases might regret it if they find out that the product is not worth what they spent. Consumers who delay their purchase may regret from missing a discount or facing a stockout. Regret explains two types of behavioral patterns: inertia (delayed purchase) and frenzies (buying early at negative surplus). Action regret reduces profits as well as the value of advance selling and booking limit policies for price-setting firms. The insight for management: Profit loss effects of regret on profits can be mitigated by marketing campaigns, refund offers, and product resales.Double Marginalization in Performance-Based Advertising: Implications and Solutions (p. 1178) Chrysanthos Dellarocas How should online advertisers and sellers establish the value of an online advertisement? An important current trend in advertising is the replacement of traditional pay-per-exposure (pay-per-impression) pricing models with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such pay-per-action (PPA) mechanisms such as pay-per-click, pay-per-call, and pay-per-sale are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. However, such advertising methods may affect market pricing. The author suggests that if advertisers set prices to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, PPA mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upward), reducing both consumer surplus and the joint publisher\u2013advertiser profit. The insight for management: Popular PPA advertising fee mechanisms should be restructured in ways that benefit both seller and buyer.The Strategic Perils of Low Cost Outsourcing (p. 1196) Qi Feng, Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu Does low cost outsourcing always lead to a win\u2013win outcome for both supplier and manufacturer? The authors show that low cost outsourcing may lead to a win\u2013lose outcome in which the suppliers gain and the manufacturers lose. This happens because suppliers' cost advantage may backfire on competing manufacturers through two negative effects. First, a decrease of upstream cost weakens a manufacturer's bargaining position because a competing manufacturer can obtain a low cost position through outsourcing. Second, the common supplier's bargaining position is strengthened with a lower-cost structure that can serve either manufacturer. The authors explain the importance of considering competition in the outsourcing decision. Because the supplier engages in two negotiations, its share of profit from the trade with one manufacturer affects the total surplus of the trade with the other manufacturer. The insight for management: Outsourcing to a common low cost supplier might have surprising consequences; despite the reduction in manufacturer bargaining power, profit may actually increase, further increasing the incentive to outsource.Information Technology and Trademarks: Implications for Product Variety (p. 1211) Guodong (Gordon) Gao, Lorin M. Hitt Is there a connection between information technology (IT) and trademarks? The authors use an 11-year panel data set (1987\u20131997) of IT capital stock, trademark holdings, and other measures for 116 Fortune 1000 manufacturing firms and find that IT contributes to higher trademark holdings. They also find evidence suggesting that firms with more IT capital tend to apply for more new trademarks and retire existing trademarks more quickly, leading to a shorter trademark life cycle. The insight for management: Because trademarks are mainly used by firms to communicate differences among similar products to the marketplace, the business value of IT can be realized in greater product variety.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1588","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['independent', 'governance', 'public health', 'social benefit']","The article touches on themes of governance and public health, indicating some awareness of ethical considerations in business practices.

How much is too much and how quickly is too quickly depends on the characteristics of the product relative to the time interval between consumption periods. Knowing that, consumers allocate their budget to products that generate less satiation effects. Retailers should then choose to sell products that induce minimal satiation, but usually this is operationally more costly. To study this trade-off, we provide an analytical model based on utility theory that relates customer consumption to price and satiation, in the context of multiple competing retailers. We determine the purchasing pattern over time and provide an explicit expression to determine the consumption level in steady state. We derive market shares and show that they take the form of an attraction model in which the attractiveness depends on price and product satiation. We use this to analyze the competition between firms that maximize long-term average profit. We characterize the equilibrium under three scenarios: (i) price-only competition, (ii) product-only competition, and (iii) price and product competition. The results reveal the interplay between a key marketing lever (price) and the firm's ability to offer products that generate less satiation. In particular, we show that when a firm becomes more efficient at reducing satiation, its competitor may benefit if competition is on product only, but not if it is on price and product. We also find that when satiation effects are not managed, a firm's profit may be significantly reduced while a strategic competitor can largely benefit.

Whereas prior literature in information systems has highlighted the likelihood of ex post rent seeking engendered by renegotiation, we build upon literature on incomplete contracts to posit that renegotiation can be Pareto improving by incorporating contingencies revealed ex post. Research on contract renegotiation has been hampered by two sets of challenges: the lack of appropriate data and empirical challenges in identification. We circumvent this problem both by appropriate data collection and by employing an identification strategy to address alternate causal explanations. We propose a measure, Pareto improving amendments, to assess renegotiation outcomes that enhance the value from outsourcing by hazard equilibration and by incorporating learning. Using a unique sample of 141 IT outsourcing contracts, we examine the role of decision rights delineated ex ante in enabling Pareto improving amendments and in resolving the trade-off between adaptation and rent seeking. We find that flexibility provisions, termination for convenience rights, and contractual rights whereby vendors are granted rights to reuse know-how are associated with Pareto improving amendments. The results are robust to potential endogeneity of contractual provisions when parties have feasible foresight and to the possibility of adverse selection in the sample. We also examine alternate explanations from the literature on contractual breach. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.

However, little progress has been made in disentangling these two roles of detailing in empirical research. In this paper, we provide a new identification strategy to address this problem. Our key identification assumptions are that the informative component of detailing is chemical specific and the persuasive component is brand specific. Our strategy is to focus on markets where some drug manufacturers engage in a comarketing agreement, under which two or more companies market the same chemical using their own brand names. With our identification assumptions, the variation in the relative market shares of these two brands, together with their brand specific detailing efforts, would allow us to measure the persuasive component of detailing. The variation in the market shares of chemicals, and the detailing efforts summed across brands made of the same chemical, would allow us to measure the informative component of detailing. Using the data for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with diuretic in Canada, we find evidence that our identification strategy can help disentangle these two effects. Although both effects are statistically significant, we find that the persuasive function of detailing plays a very minor role in determining the demand at the chemical level\u2014the informative role of detailing is mainly responsible for the diffusion patterns of chemicals.

How can this interface be better managed? The authors introduce a \u201crandomized most-idle\u201d (RMI) routing policy and analyze it in the quality- and efficiency-driven regime. The RMI policy results in the same fairness in work levels as the \u201clongest-idle-first\u201d policy, which is commonly used in call centers and is considered fair. The advantage of RMI is that it does not require detailed information on the wards that is not typically available in real time in the emergency room to be used.

The insight for management: The gambler's fallacy has empirical support; post-earnings-announcement drift has a significant time-series component.Information Environment and Equity Risk Premium Volatility Around the World (p. 1322) Sie Ting Lau, Lilian Ng, Bohui Zhang How do factors such as a country's information disclosure, accounting standards, and financial transparency relate to cross-country differences in the market risk premium volatility? Using time variation in risk premiums for 41 developed and emerging markets, the authors find that countries with better information environments tend to experience a lower risk premium volatility. They analyze two major events, the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis, and find evidence that information environments play an important role in explaining market risk premium variability. The insight for management: Financial transparency has benefits; it allows for lower risk premium volatility.Efficient Cost Allocation (p. 1341) Korok Ray, Maris Goldmanis How should a firm allocate the costs of common corporate resources such as information technology, legal services, human resource management, and executive time to its divisions? Divisions charged an \u201caverage cost\u201d have an incentive to overconsume corporate resources. We propose a new allocation rule, the polynomial rule, which achieves efficiency and approximate budget balance. Welfare losses due to linear allocation rules increase with firm size, so polynomial allocation rules dominate linear rules for larger firms. The insight for management: Any efficient allocation rule must reflect the firm's underlying cost structure.Product and Price Competition with Satiation Effects (p. 1357) Felipe Caro, Victor Mart\u00ednez-de-Alb\u00e9niz Hot fashions command huge profits through both high volumes as product flies off the shelves. However, demand can dry up quickly as customers become satiated. So how much volume is too much, and how can retailers like Zara avoid the satiation effect? The answers to these questions depend on the characteristics of the product and the time interval. Knowing that, consumers allocate their budgets to products that generate less satiation effects. Retailers should then choose to sell products that induce minimal satiation, but usually this is operationally more costly. The authors examine a number of different competitive situations (price only, product only, and both price and product) to determine the long-run average profit-maximizing strategy. In particular, they show that when a firm becomes more efficient at reducing satiation, its competitor may benefit if competition is on product only, but not if it is on price and product. The insight for management: When satiation effects are not managed, a firm's profit may be significantly reduced while a strategic competitor can largely benefit.Measuring the Informative and Persuasive Roles of Detailing on Prescribing Decisions (p. 1374) Andrew T. Ching, Masakazu Ishihara Pharmaceutical representatives spend their days \u201cdetailing\u201d\u2014visiting physicians' offices sharing news, clinical results, and product samples. The sales reps often provide the doctors with pens, pads, free lunches, and much more. So how much of the detailer's work is informative, and how much is persuasive? In the pharmaceutical industry, measuring the importance of informative and persuasive roles of detailing is crucial for both drug manufacturers and policy makers. The authors split those two roles in this way: The informative component of detailing is chemical specific, and the persuasive component is brand specific. Some drug manufacturers engage in a comarketing agreement, under which two or more companies market the same chemical using their own brand names. Variation in market share for the chemical component depends on information; variation in relative market share for each brand depends on persuasion. The authors use data for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with diuretic in Canada and find that both effects are statistically significant but that the persuasive function of detailing plays a minor role in determining the demand at the chemical level\u2014the informative role of detailing is mainly responsible for the diffusion patterns of chemicals. On the other hand, the persuasive role of detailing plays a crucial role in determining the demand for brands that comarket the same chemical. The insight for management: The patient comes first; doctors use the drug that fits the need, but, given a choice between two identical options, they recommend the brand that bought lunch that week.Contractual Flexibility, Rent Seeking, and Renegotiation Design: An Empirical Analysis of Information Technology Outsourcing Contracts (p. 1388) Anjana Susarla How does contract renegotiation structure affect contract efficiency for outsourced information technology (IT) services? Usually, it is believed that service providers try to profit in renegotiation of the contract. The author suggests that renegotiation can improve efficiency by incorporating contingencies revealed after the contract is negotiated. Using a unique sample of 141 IT outsourcing contracts, she finds that flexibility provisions, termination for convenience rights, and contractual rights (whereby vendors are granted rights to reuse know-how) are associated with efficiency-improving amendments. The results are robust to contractual provisions when parties have feasible foresight into those contingencies. The insight for management: IT contracts can be written more efficiently with reasonable contingencies in place instead of planned renegotiations.The Power of Diversity over Large Solution Spaces (p. 1408) Marco LiCalzi, Oktay Surucu Is there power in numbers, or in diversity, or both? The authors consider a team with limited problem-solving ability facing a challenging problem with many possible solutions. The insights for management are many. First, two heads are better than one: A team of two agents will solve the problem even if neither agent alone would be able to. Second, teaming up does not guarantee success: If the agents are not sufficiently creative, even a team of arbitrary size may fail to solve the problem. Third, defendit numerus: When the agent's problem-solving ability is adversely affected by the complexity of the solution space, the solution of the problem requires only a mild increase in the size of the team. Fourth, groupthink impairs the power of diversity: If agents' abilities are positively correlated, a larger team is necessary to solve the problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1595","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['diversity', 'public opinion', 'ethical', 'managerial ability']","The article discusses the influence of public opinion on executive compensation and highlights the importance of diversity in problem-solving, indicating a moderate emphasis on ethical considerations and social dynamics in business practices."],["2012","58","7","Dimitris BertsimasDimitris BertsimasMassachusetts Institute of TechnologySearch for more papers by this author, Eric BradlowEric BradlowUniversity of PennsylvaniaSearch for more papers by this author, Noah GansNoah GansUniversity of PennsylvaniaSearch for more papers by this author, Alok GuptaAlok GuptaUniversity of MinnesotaSearch for more papers by this author","Call for Papers\u2014Special Issue of Management Science: Business Analytics","Organizations today have access to enormous data sets, and sophisticated business analytical tools are needed to harness the tremendous potential of  these data to improve day-to-day decision making. To encourage further developments in this rapidly growing area of interdisciplinary research, Management Science will publish a special issue dedicated to business analytics. Applications of business analytics extend to nearly all managerial functions in an organization. Using microlevel data, mathematical models can become more realistic, be validated more easily, and match more closely true behavioral phenomena. Through business analytics, historical data can be used to discover relationships among important elements in an organization's environment, make more formal statistical inferences regarding the structure or strength of these relationships, and improve actions taken by the organization. Because these relationships are often not static, the entire cycle of identification, estimation, prediction, and decision making is repeated frequently and on an ongoing basis, leading to real-time and highly targeted data-driven decisions.  We envision business analytics applied to many domains, including, but surely not limited to: digital market design and operation; network and social-graph analysis; pricing and revenue management; targeted marketing and customer relationship management; fraud and security; sports and entertainment; retailing to healthcare to financial services to many other industries. We seek novel modeling and empirical work which includes, among others, probability modeling, structural empirical models, and/or optimization methods.

Our empirical study is motivated by two fundamental aspects in the design of CAs: (1) which packages should bidders be allowed to bid on and (2) diversifying the supplier base to promote competition. We use bidding data to uncover important aspects of the firms' cost structure and their strategic behavior, both of which are not directly observed by the auctioneer; these estimates inform the auction design. Our results indicate that package bidding that allows firms to express their cost synergies due to economies of scale and density seems appropriate. However, we also found evidence that firms can take advantage of this flexibility by discounting package bids for strategic reasons and not driven by cost synergies. Because this behavior can lead to inefficiencies, it may be worth evaluating whether to prohibit certain specific combinations in the bidding process. Our results also suggest that market share restrictions and running sequential auctions seem to promote competition in the long run, without significantly increasing the short-run cost for the government due to unrealized cost synergies. Our results highlight that the simultaneous consideration of the firms' operational cost structure and their strategic behavior is key to the successful design of a CA. More broadly, our paper is the first to provide an econometric study of a large-scale CA, providing novel and substantive insights regarding bidding behavior in this type of auction.

However, in today's world, MBGs are ubiquitous among major retailers, even when the likelihood of product return varies greatly between them. To understand this phenomenon, we explore a competitive environment between high- and low-quality retailers where consumers are fully informed and risk neutral, and retailers realize a salvage value for returned products. When MBGs are profitable, under continuous demand it is Nash equilibrium for both retailers to offer MBGs, and the low-quality retailer gains while the high-quality retailer loses relative to when MBGs are not offered. In contrast, if demand is lumpy, retailers can act monopolistically over their respective market segments, allowing both retailers to gain from MBGs, although the low-quality retailer still gains more.

The efficiency rationale, as discussed under the transaction cost economics and property rights theories, posits that vertical integration mitigates contractual inefficiencies between suppliers and customers (termed as holdup) and provides incentives to undertake relationship-specific investments. In contrast, the foreclosure and collusion rationales suggest that vertical integration is anticompetitive in nature. Specifically, the foreclosure argument suggests that vertical integration is used to raise costs of rival firms, and the collusion argument suggests that vertical integration facilitates coordination between the integrated firm and its rivals. To distinguish between the three hypotheses, we examine (1) the announcement period wealth effects to the merging firms, rival firms, and customer firms; and (2) the operating performance changes to the merging firms in vertical takeovers.

The objective of the system operator (the client) is to minimize the sum of staffing costs, customer waiting costs, and mistreatment costs due to unsuccessful attempts by a gatekeeper to solve the customer's problem. The client may outsource all or part of the process to a vendor, and first-best contracts exist when the client outsources only gatekeepers or experts. When the client outsources the entire system as a two-level process, a client-optimal contract may not exist unless the exogenous system parameters satisfy a particular (and unlikely) coordination condition. In addition, optimal incentive-compatible contracts exist when the vendor's structure choice (one level or two levels) can deviate from the client's preference. Finally, we numerically examine how vendor structure choice and labor cost advantages influence the client's optimal outsourcing option.

Weintraub, Rafael Epstein, Daniel Yung How should combinatorial auctions be structured to assure sufficient competition and efficiency of the outcome? The authors evaluate a combinatorial auction for the one half billion dollar Chilean school meal services. They explore which packages bidders should be allowed to bid on and how to diversify the supplier base to promote competition. Their results indicate that package bidding that allows firms to express their cost synergies due to economies of scale and density seems appropriate, but they also found evidence that firms can take advantage of this flexibility by discounting package bids for strategic reasons and not driven by cost synergies. The authors suggest that, because this behavior can lead to inefficiencies, it may be worth evaluating whether to prohibit certain combinations in the bidding process. Their results also suggest that market share restrictions and running sequential auctions seem to promote competition in the long run, without significantly increasing the short-run cost for the government due to unrealized cost synergies. The insight for management: Simultaneous consideration of the firms' operational cost structure and their strategic behavior is key to the successful design of a combinatorial auction.An Examination of the Efficiency, Foreclosure, and Collusion Rationales for Vertical Takeovers (p. 1482) Jaideep Shenoy Vertical takeovers: Are they good or bad? The author investigates the efficiency argument versus the foreclosure and collusion rationales for vertical integration based on a large sample of vertically related takeovers. The efficiency rationale posits that vertical integration mitigates contractual inefficiencies between suppliers and customers and provides incentives to undertake relationship-specific investments. In contrast, the foreclosure and collusion rationales suggest that vertical integration is anticompetitive in nature. Specifically, the foreclosure argument suggests that vertical integration is used to raise costs of rival firms, and the collusion argument suggests that vertical integration facilitates coordination between the integrated firm and its rivals. To distinguish among the three hypotheses, the author examines (1) the announcement period wealth effects to the merging firms, rival firms, and customer firms; and (2) the operating performance changes to the merging firms in vertical takeovers.

O'Doherty Do stocks with high probabilities of bankruptcy or default earn anomalously low returns? The author shows that financially distressed stocks have relatively low exposure to market risk during bad economic times. The author proposes a construct called conditional CAPM, which successfully explains the distress anomaly because conditional betas for distressed stocks are negatively correlated with the market risk premium and positively correlated with market volatility. The insight for management: A theoretical model has been developed to explain an anomaly in which a levered firm's equity beta is negatively related to uncertainty about the unobserved value of its underlying assets.Money-Back Guarantees: Helping the Low-Quality Retailer (p. 1521) Bruce McWilliams Do money-back guarantees help retailers of low quality? Traditionally, money-back guarantees (MBGs) are utilized by high-quality firms that feature a low likelihood of product return to signal their high quality to consumers. However, MBGs are becoming ubiquitous among major retailers, even when the likelihood of product return varies greatly among them. The author explores a competitive environment between high- and low-quality retailers. The author suggests that, if MBGs are profitable, then it is rational for both retailers to offer MBGs, but, interestingly, the low-quality retailer gains while the high-quality retailer loses relative to when MBGs are not offered. In contrast, if demand is lumpy, retailers can act monopolistically over their respective market segments, allowing both retailers to gain from MBGs, although the low-quality retailer still gains more. The insight for management: Surprisingly, lower-quality retailers might benefit more from money-back guarantees than high-quality retailers.Social Learning Through Endogenous Information Acquisition: An Experiment (p. 1525) Bo\u011fa\u00e7han \u00c7elen, Kyle Hyndman How does interaction between individuals affect the dissemination of information? The authors explore social learning through information acquisition of participants in an experiment where a group faces a decision problem under uncertainty. Each person is given private information about the fundamentals of the problem and makes decisions sequentially while observing others make their decisions. The authors show that social welfare can be enhanced by incurring the small cost of collecting information on previous decisions. However, the authors note that there are important deviations from rationality such as a tendency to conform. They conclude that, given such biases, ironically, subjects would often have been better off not forming any links in the problem-solving process. The insight for management: Despite the potential for information sharing in the problem-solving process, natural human tendencies for irrationality can lead to suboptimal solutions in group decision making.From Wires to Partners: How the Internet Has Fostered R&D Collaborations Within Firms (p. 1549) Chris Forman, Nicolas van Zeebroeck How did the diffusion of the Internet influence research collaborations within firms?

On the contrary, they find no evidence of such a link between Internet adoption and within-location collaborative patents, nor do they find any evidence of a relationship between basic Internet and single-inventor patents.

The insight for management: The Internet seems to build better teamwork among geographically disperse teams, but it does not necessarily improve research productivity overall.Outsourcing a Two-Level Service Process (p. 1569) Hsiao-Hui Lee, Edieal J. Pinker, Robert A. Shumsky In a call center, there are often two or more skill levels and cost levels: a first level \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for simpler calls, and a second \u201cexpert\u201d level support. What is the best structure for such an outsourced operation when trying to balance cost and service considerations? The client seeks to find a combination of internally provided and outsourced service to minimize staffing costs, customer waiting costs, and mistreatment costs due to unsuccessful attempts by a gatekeeper to solve the customer's problem. Efficient contracts can result when the client outsources only gatekeepers or experts. However, when the client outsources the entire system as a two-level process, an optimal contract may not exist unless a challengingly high level of coordination is maintained. If the vendor is allowed to choose the structure of the support system, more efficient contracts can be constructed. The insight for management: The outsourcing client should allow the contractor some latitude in determining the structure of service provision.Psychological Pressure in Competitive Environments: New Evidence from Randomized Natural Experiments (p. 1585) Martin G. Kocher, Marc V. Lenz, Matthias Sutter In a soccer shootout, is it better to go first or second? Going first can put the pressure on, or take the pressure off, the other team, who might be affected psychologically by the information. More broadly, psychological pressure could produce a first-mover advantage, even though each team is equally skilled. Previous research finds a large advantage for first movers; these authors do not find such an advantage\u2014at least for soccer shootouts. The insight for management: Contrary to prior findings, the psychological advantage of being a first mover seems to be moot; going first or second in soccer shootouts seems to make little difference to outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1613","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit risk measurement and banking performance without addressing any social justice themes or ethical critiques.

We model a supply chain consisting of a single buyer and two suppliers, both of which compete for the buyer's order and face risk of supply disruption. One supplier is comparatively more reliable but also more expensive, whereas the other one is less reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Moreover, the risk level of the unreliable supplier may be private information, and this lack of visibility increases the buyer's purchasing risk. In such settings, the unreliable supplier often provides a price and quantity (P&Q) guarantee to the buyer. Our objective is to study the underlying motivation for the guarantee offer and its effects on the competitive intensity and the performance of the chain partners. Our model also includes a spot market that can be utilized by any party to buy or to sell. The spot market price is random, partially depends on the available capacity of the two suppliers, and has a positive spread between buying and selling prices. We analytically characterize the equilibrium contracts for the two suppliers and the buyer's optimal procurement strategy. First, our analysis shows that P&Q guarantee allows the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. More importantly, when information asymmetry risk is high, use of a guarantee may enable the unreliable supplier to credibly signal her true risk, thereby improving visibility into the chain. This signal can also be used by the buyer to infer the expected spot market price. In spite of these benefits, a guarantee offer in an asymmetric setting may not always be desirable for the buyer. Rather, it can reduce competition between the suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer.

However, when the disparity of utility becomes too great, the objective becomes progressively utilitarian. Such a model is particularly applicable not only to health provision but to other areas as well. Building a mixed-integer/linear programming (MILP) formulation of the problem raises technical issues, because the objective function is nonconvex and the hypograph is not MILP representable in its initial form. We present a succinct formulation and show that it is \u201csharp\u201d in the sense that its linear programming relaxation describes the convex hull of the feasible set (before extra resource allocation or policy constraints are added).

We study one contributing factor: prior near-miss experiences. Near misses are events that have some nontrivial expectation of ending in disaster but, by chance, do not. We demonstrate that when near misses are interpreted as disasters that did not occur, people illegitimately underestimate the danger of subsequent hazardous situations and make riskier decisions (e.g., choosing not to engage in mitigation activities for the potential hazard). On the other hand, if near misses can be recognized and interpreted as disasters that almost happened, this will counter the basic \u201cnear-miss\u201d effect and encourage more mitigation. We illustrate the robustness of this pattern across populations with varying levels of real expertise with hazards and different hazard contexts (household evacuation for a hurricane, Caribbean cruises during hurricane season, and deep-water oil drilling).

Relative regret evaluates a portfolio by comparing its return to a family of benchmarks, where the benchmarks are the wealths of fictitious investors who invest optimally given knowledge of the model parameters, and is a natural objective when there is concern about parameter uncertainty or model ambiguity. The optimal relative regret portfolio is the one that performs well in relation to all the benchmarks over the family of possible parameter values. We analyze this problem using convex duality and show that it is equivalent to a Bayesian problem, where the Lagrange multipliers play the role of the prior distribution, and the learning model involves Bayesian updating of these Lagrange multipliers/prior. This Bayesian problem is unusual in that the prior distribution is endogenously chosen by solving the dual optimization problem for the Lagrange multipliers, and the objective function involves the family of benchmarks from the relative regret problem.

In this research we undertake several experiments to explore consumer response to modularly upgradeable products in settings featuring technological change. We consider both the initial product choice (between a modularly upgradeable product and an integral one) and the subsequent upgrade decision (replacement of a module versus full product replacement). First, we show that consumers tend to discount the cost savings associated with modular upgrades excessively (insufficiently) when the time between the initial purchase and the upgrade is short (long). This suggests that modular upgradability as a product feature has higher profit potential for slowly rather than rapidly improving products. Second, we observe a preference reversal between the initial purchase and the point of upgrade: At the point of initial purchase, people foresee making a full product replacement in the future, yet, when faced with the actual upgrade decision, they are more likely to revert to modular upgrades. Finally, we discuss and test several pricing and product design strategies that the firm can use to respond to these cognitive biases.

Tinsley, Robin L. Dillon, Matthew A. Cronin When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, the public and media alike wondered why so many people failed to evacuate and why the government and first-responder organizations were not prepared. These questions tend to arise in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters, and the answers can often be found in people's previous experiences.

These often completely take over the sourcing function: They select, verify, and approve suppliers; they allocate business between different suppliers; and they manage the relationship with each supplier, including provision of incentives for investments, performance, and compliance. The authors provide a novel explanation for the use of supply chain intermediaries. They find that, even in the absence of the well-known transactional and informational advantages of mediation, intermediaries improve supply chain performance. In particular, intermediaries facilitate responsive adaptation of the buyers' supplier base to their changing needs while simultaneously ensuring that suppliers behave as if they had long-term sourcing commitments from buying firms.

N. Hooker, H. P. Williams How can mathematical models blend the needs of the conflicting objectives of equity and utilitarianism in social policy making such as healthcare? Equity is the maximization of the minimum utility over individuals or classes of individuals. Utilitarianism maximizes the efficiency or total benefit generated regardless of its distribution.

The authors apply the formulation to a healthcare planning problem to demonstrate that these problems are easily solved by standard software.

The risk of supply disruption increases as firms seek to procure from cheaper, but unproven, suppliers. Imagine a supplier that is comparatively more reliable but also more expensive than another supplier that is less reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Which to choose? The problem is complicated only if it might be hard to recognize the unreliable supplier, increasing the buyer's purchasing risk. The risky supplier might provide a price and quantity guarantee to the buyer. The authors show that such guarantees allow the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. In spite of these benefits, a guarantee offer may not always be desirable for the buyer. The insight for management: Low price and volume guarantees can reduce competition between suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer.Dynamic Pricing with Financial Milestones: Feedback-Form Policies (p. 1715) Omar Besbes, Costis Maglaras How do earnings estimates affect pricing and sales behavior? The authors consider a seller that starts with an initial inventory of goods, has a target horizon over which to sell the goods, and is subject to a set of financial milestone constraints on the revenues and sales that need to be achieved at different time points along the sales horizon. For example, a builder of a multiunit, residential real estate development might have many intermediate milestone constraints on cash flow that play an important role in financing and construction plans. The authors propose an optimal policy can be written in \u201cfeedback form,\u201d where the price at each point in time is selected so as to track the most stringent among all future milestones. The authors propose a discrete-review policy that aims to dynamically track the appropriate milestones, and they show that this simple and practical policy is nearly optimal in settings with large initial capacity and long sales horizons even in settings with no advance demand model information. The insight for management: Choose your goals carefully; they have real impact on pricing and production plans over time.Robust Portfolio Choice with Learning in the Framework of Regret: Single-Period Case (p. 1732) Andrew E.

The authors propose a mechanism through which each party provides relevant private information to an intermediary who ultimately reveals only the portfolio contents and price paid, and only to the seller and winning broker. The insight for management: There may be a substantial potential benefit to sellers of such an intermediary; a seller can reduce expected transaction costs by more than 10% through this approach.Consumer Valuation of Modularly Upgradeable Products (p. 1761) Sezer \u00dclk\u00fc, Claudiu V. Dimofte, Glen M. Schmidt Products such as PCs, cameras, and cell phones can be released more quickly, with more future feature flexibility, and can achieve a longer product life through a modular design. Although product modularity is often advocated as a valuable design strategy in operations, little is known about how consumers respond to modular products. The authors describe consumer response to modularly upgradeable products in settings featuring technological change. They consider both the initial product design choice and the subsequent consumer upgrade decision to replace a module or replace the entire product. The authors find that consumers tend to discount the cost savings associated with modular upgrades excessively when the time between the initial purchase and the upgrade is short and tend to value it excessively over longer intervals. This finding suggests that modular upgradability as a product feature has higher profit potential for slowly rather than rapidly improving products. The authors also observe a preference reversal between the initial purchase and the point of upgrade: At the point of initial purchase, people foresee making a full product replacement in the future, yet, when faced with the actual upgrade decision, they are more likely to revert to modular upgrades. The insight for management: Consumers' perspectives on modular products evolve the use of the product, directly affecting the desirability of modular design.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1636","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['risk', 'decision making', 'supply chain', 'governance']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and supply chain management without a significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

When orders from the retailers exceed the supplier's capacity, she must employ an allocation mechanism to balance supply and demand. In particular, we consider a commonly used allocation scheme in the automobile industry: turn-and-earn, which uses past sales to allocate capacity. In essence, retailers \u201cearn\u201d an allotment of a vehicle after they sell one. In contrast to turn-and-earn, fixed allocation ignores past sales and gives each retailer an equal share of the capacity. Earlier work has demonstrated that turn-and-earn induces more sales in a two-period setting compared to fixed allocation. The question remains unanswered whether turn-and-earn induces similar behaviors over a long horizon when retailers possess private demand information. We construct a dynamic stochastic game of order competition over an infinite horizon to track the order dynamics of the supply chain. We obtain a richer set of equilibrium behaviors than existing models predict. Instead of a symmetric allocation outcome, we observe that sales leadership may arise in equilibrium and that retailers with different past sales adopt distinct ordering strategies to respond to demand uncertainty. Transient sales dynamics suggest that sales leadership may not be persistent and can be eliminated by the occurrence of extremely low demand. This provides a theoretical explanation for several behavioral observations of some U.S. automobile dealers. In addition to the sales-inducing effect, interestingly, turn-and-earn also causes the retailers to absorb local demand variability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0346","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and allocation mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The workload is the number of operating room hours used by a medical specialty on a given day to perform surgical procedures. Variable costs consist of wages at a regular (scheduled) rate and at an overtime rate when the realized workload exceeds the scheduled time. Using a newsvendor framework, we consider the problem of determining optimal staffing levels with different information sets available at the time of decision: no information, information on number of cases, and information on number and types of cases. We develop empirical models for the daily workload distribution in which the mean and variance change with the information available. We use these models to derive optimal staffing rules based on historical data from a U.S. teaching hospital and prospectively test the performance of these rules. Our numerical results suggest that hospitals could potentially reduce their staffing costs by up to 39%\u201349% by deferring staffing decisions until procedure type information is available. The results demonstrate how data availability can affect a newsvendor's performance. The systematic approach of empirical modeling presented in the paper can be applied to other newsvendor problems with heterogeneous sources of demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0350","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of staffing decisions and cost reduction in hospital operating rooms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider a two-stage supply chain with a single supplier selling its product to consumers through a single retailer. We assume that both the supplier and the retailer can improve the quality of their demand forecasts by making costly forecasting investments to gather and analyze information. First, we consider a noncollaborative model where the supplier and the retailer can invest in forecasting but do not share forecast information. Next, we examine a collaborative forecasting model where the supplier and the retailer combine their information to form a single shared demand forecast. We investigate the value of CF by comparing each party's profits in these scenarios under three contractual forms that are widely used in practice (two variations of the simple wholesale price contract as well as the buyback contract). We show that for a given set of parameters, CF may be Pareto improving for none to all three of the contractual structures, and that the Pareto regions under all three contractual structures can be expressed with a unifying expression that admits an intuitive interpretation. We observe that these regions are limited and explain how they are shaped by the contractual structure, power balance, and relative forecasting capability of the parties. To determine the specific value of collaborative forecasting as a function of different factors, we carry out a numerical analysis and observe the following. First, under noncoordinating contracts, improved information as a result of CF has the added benefit of countering the adverse effects of double marginalization in addition to reducing the cost of supply\u2013demand mismatch. Second, one may expect the value of CF to increase with bargaining power, however this does not hold in general: The value of CF for the newsvendor first increases and then decreases in his bargaining power. Finally, whereas one may expect CF to be more valuable under coordinating contracts, rather than a simple wholesale price contract that is prone to double marginalization, the magnitude of the gain from CF is in many cases higher in the absence of quantity coordination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0351","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['collaborative forecasting', 'supply chain', 'contractual structure']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of forecasting in supply chains without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In essence, BPS is a process innovation that reduces the marginal cost of the original product and/or the by-product. The firm creates value through this process innovation and can capture this value by capturing newly created market opportunities, taking market share from competitors, or licensing the innovation to its competitors. We determine the optimal operating and licensing strategies for the firm and find market conditions under which the firm would benefit most from implementing BPS. We show that the optimal operating and licensing strategies are driven by the size of the cost reduction enabled by the BPS process innovation. We also show that leveraging the synergies between the original product and by-product can lead to counterintuitive profit-maximizing operating strategies such as increasing the amount of waste generated, and strategically increasing the quantity of original product above the business as usual production volume. We present a framework for assessing the environmental impact of BPS that incorporates the impact of the optimal operating and licensing strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0352","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['environmental impact', 'process innovation', 'value creation']","The article discusses the environmental impact of converting waste into by-products, highlighting process innovation and value creation.

We investigate the performance of auctions with rank feedback in a simple setting for which analytical benchmarks are readily available. We test these benchmarks in the laboratory by comparing the performance of auctions with rank-based feedback to auctions with full-price feedback as well as to auctions with no price feedback (sealed-bid auctions). When bidders are risk-neutral expected-profit maximizers, the buyer's expected costs should be the same under rank and full-price feedback; moreover, expected buyer costs should be the same as in a sealed-bid auction. However, when we test this theoretical equality in a controlled laboratory setting we find that, consistent with practitioners' beliefs but contrary to our model, rank feedback results in lower average prices than full-price feedback. We identify two behavioral reasons for the difference. The first explanation is based on the similarity of the bidders' problem in a sealed-bid first-price auction and an open-bid auction with rank feedback. The second explanation incorporates the use of jump bids motivated by bidder impatience.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0354","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of procurement auctions and bidder behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The supply chain we study consists of a profit-maximizing manufacturer with a quantity-discount schedule that is nonincreasing in quantity and ensures nondecreasing revenue, a profit-maximizing GPO, a competitive source selling at a fixed unit price, and n providers (e.g., hospitals) with fixed demands for a single product. Each provider seeks to minimize its total purchasing cost (i.e., the cost of the goods plus the provider's own fixed transaction cost). Buying through the GPO offers providers possible cost reductions but may involve a membership fee. Selling through the GPO offers the manufacturer possibly higher volumes, but requires that the manufacturer pay the GPO a contract administration fee (CAF), i.e., a percentage of all revenue contracted through it. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine questions about this supply chain, including how the presence of a GPO affects the providers' total purchasing costs. We also address the controversy about whether Congress should amend the Social Security Act, which, under current law, permits CAFs. Among other things, we conclude that although CAFs affect the distribution of profits between manufacturers and GPOs, they do not affect the providers' total purchasing costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0355","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['cost reduction', 'providers', 'supply chain']","The article primarily focuses on the economic aspects of supply chains and cost minimization without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth.

We solve for the buyer's optimal procurement contract. We show that the optimal contract can be interpreted as the buyer choosing between diversification and competition benefits. Better information increases diversification benefits and decreases competition benefits. Therefore, with better information the buyer is more inclined to diversify. Moreover, better information may increase or decrease the value of the dual-sourcing option, depending on the buyer's unit revenue: for large revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for diversification, the benefits of which increase with information; for small revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for competition, the benefits of which decrease with information. Surprisingly, as the reliability of the entire supply base decreases, the buyer may stop diversifying under asymmetric information (to leverage competition), whereas it would never do so under symmetric information. Finally, we analyze the effect of codependence between supply disruptions. We find that lower codependence leads the buyer to rely less on competition. Because competition keeps the information costs in check, a reduction in supplier codependence increases the buyer's value of information. Therefore, strategic actions to reduce codependence between supplier disruptions should not be seen as a substitute for learning about suppliers' reliabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0358","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement strategies and supplier reliability without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

At the same time, the waste-to-energy firm serves and collects revenue from two types of customers: waste generators who pay for waste disposal service and electricity consumers who buy energy. Given the process characteristics of the waste-to-energy operation, the market characteristics for waste disposal and energy, and the mechanisms regulators use to encourage production of renewable energy, we determine the profit-maximizing operating strategy of the firm. We also show how regulatory mechanisms affect the operating decisions of the waste-to-energy firm. Our analyses suggest that if the social planner's objective is to maximize landfill diversion, offering a subsidy as a per kilowatt-hour for electricity is more cost effective, whereas if the objective is to maximize renewable energy generation, giving a subsidy as a lump sum to offset capital costs is more effective.

Although customers value reservations, restaurants typically neither charge for them nor impose penalties for failing to keep them. However, reservations impose costs on firms offering them. We offer a novel motivation for offering reservations that emphasizes the way in which reservations can alter customer behavior. We focus on a market in which demand is uncertain and the firm has limited capacity. There is a positive chance that the firm will not have enough capacity to serve all potential customers. Customers are unable to observe how many potential diners are in the market before incurring a cost to request service. Hence, if reservations are not offered, some may choose to stay home rather than risk being denied service. This lowers the firm's sales when realized demand is low. Reservations increase sales on a slow night by guaranteeing reservations holders service. However, some reservation holders may choose not to use their reservations resulting in no-shows. The firm must then trade off higher sales in a soft market with sales lost to no-shows on busy nights.

DMEP combines dual-source (i.e., a less-expensive-but-slower base mode and a faster-but-more-expensive flexible mode) procurement with option contracts in three layers: a contract negotiation layer, where the firm chooses the best combination of lead time and price for each mode from the supply contract menu; a capacity reservation layer, where the firm reserves total equipment procurement quantities from the two supply modes before the planning horizon starts; and an execution layer, where the firm orders equipment from the two supply modes based on the updated demand information. We first investigate the execution layer as a dynamic dual-source capacity expansion problem with demand backlogging and demonstrate that the optimal policy lacks structure even under the simplest setting. Thus, we propose a heuristic solution for the execution-layer problem, which also serves as a building block for the other two layers. Through numerical analysis, we quantify the value of the added flexibility of DMEP for the firm. The DMEP framework has been implemented at Intel Corporation and has resulted in savings of tens of millions of dollars for one process technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0361","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity planning and procurement without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Under such a contract the distributor pays the plant a fixed price if the plant is operational and nothing if plant outage occurs. Pricing a unit-contingent contract is complicated by the fact that the plant's true status is its private information. The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributor's expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered. We find that some type of misreporting under certain circumstances can benefit both the plant and the distributor, because it serves as a risk-allocation mechanism between the two parties. We show that such a risk-allocation mechanism is equivalent to using state-contingent options and prohibiting misreporting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0362","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of power purchase agreements and information asymmetry without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model). Comparisons with simulations confirm that the approximations can be useful to assess the impact of the dependence.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0363","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and performance metrics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When a customer demand occurs at a stocked-out retailer, that retailer requests a unit to be transshipped from another retailer who charges a transshipment price. If this request is rejected, the unsatisfied customer may go to another retailer with a customer overflow probability. Each retailer decides on the initial order quantity from a manufacturer and on the acceptance/rejection of each transshipment request. For two retailers, we show that retailers' optimal transshipment policies are dynamic and characterized by chronologically nonincreasing inventory holdback levels. We analytically study the sensitivity of holdback levels to explain interesting findings, such as smaller retailers and geographically distant retailers benefit more from transshipments. Numerical experiments show that retailers substantially benefit from using optimal transshipment policies compared to no sharing. The expected sales increase in all but a handful of over 3,000 problem instances.

We consider four practically motivated special cases of this model, namely, the one-way substitution, the locational choice, the outtree, and the intree preference models, and we study the retailer's product selection problem when products have different price and cost parameters. We assume that the retailer incurs a fixed carrying cost per product offered, a goodwill penalty for each customer who does not purchase his first choice and a lost sale penalty for each customer who does not find an acceptable product to buy. For the first three models, we obtain efficient solution methods that simplify to either a shortest path method or a dynamic program.

In this paper, we study three mechanisms for dealing with product adulteration problems: (a) the deferred payment mechanism\u2014the buyer pays the supplier after the deferred payment period only if no adulteration has been discovered by the customers; (b) the inspection mechanism\u2014the buyer pays the supplier immediately, contingent on product passing the inspection; and (c) the combined mechanism\u2014a combination of the deferred payment and inspection mechanisms. We show that the inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, whereas the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, we identify four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyer's liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product. We find that the deferred payment mechanism is preferable to inspection if the threats of adulteration (either incentive to adulterate or the consequences) are low.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0366","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical mechanisms to address product adulteration without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We derive the open-loop, feedback, and myopic equilibria for this dynamic pricing game and compare it to the centralized solution. Although in an integrated supply chain a forward-looking dynamic pricing strategy is always desirable, we show that this is not the case in a decentralized setting, because of vertical competition. Our main result is that both supply chain entities are better off in the long run when they ignore the impact of current prices on future demand and focus on immediate-term profits. A numerical study confirms that this insight is robust under various supply- and demand-side effects.

This paper proposes a simple heuristic for determining stocking levels in a serial inventory system. Unlike the exact optimization algorithm, the heuristic generates a near-optimal solution by solving a series of independent single-stage systems. The heuristic is constructed based on three results we derive. First, we provide a new cost decomposition scheme based on echelon systems. Next, we show that the optimal base-stock level for each echelon system is bounded by those of two revised echelon systems. Last, we prove that the revised echelon systems are essentially equivalent to single-stage systems. We examine the myopic solution for these single-stage systems. In a numerical study, we find that the change of direction of the myopic solution is consistent with that of the optimal solution when system parameters vary. We then derive an analytical expression for the myopic solution and use it to gain insights into how to manage inventory. The analytical expression shows how future demand affects the current optimal local base-stock level; it also explains an observation that the safety stock at an upstream stage is often stable and may not increase when the demand variability increases over time. Finally, we discuss how the heuristic leads to a time-consistent coordination scheme that enables a decentralized supply chain to achieve the heuristic solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0373","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory management and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Recognizing that such behavior may not be directly observable by a seller, we examine the implications of seller uncertainty over strategic customer behavior in a markdown pricing setting. We assume that some proportion of customers purchase impulsively in the first period if the price is below their willingness to pay, while other customers strategically wait for lower prices in the second period. We consider a two-period selling season in which the seller knows the aggregate demand curve but not the proportion of customers behaving strategically. We show that a robust pricing policy that requires no knowledge of the extent of strategic behavior performs remarkably well. We extend our model to a setting with stochastic demand, and show that the robust pricing policy continues to perform well, particularly as capacity is loosened or the problem is scaled up. Our results underscore the need to recognize strategic behavior, but also suggest that in many cases effective performance is possible without precise knowledge of strategic behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0376","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and customer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of quality, and strategic in that they decide not only whether and which product variant to buy, but also when to buy, choosing the option that maximizes their utility. We derive the equilibrium of the pricing-purchasing game between the firm and the consumers. We find that the loss due to strategic customer behavior can be less with two product variants compared to the single-product benchmark, which indicates that product variety can serve as a lever when dealing with strategic customers. This benefit exists when the additional product has an inferior cost-to-quality ratio. Because of this benefit, a firm may find it attractive to sell a product variant that would be unprofitable otherwise. However, product variety can also hurt profitability due to strategic customer behavior: A product variant that would be profitable absent strategic customers can in fact be unprofitable. This can happen when customer impatience and firm costs are moderate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0377","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product variety and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In a typical call center equipped with an IVR system, customers are handled first by the IVR system, which is a computerized system that often enables customers to self-serve. Those customers whose service cannot be handled by the IVR system are sent to the second stage to be served by agents. To address the design of a call center with a flexible IVR system, we consider a call center whose IVR system can operate in two different service delivery modes that have statistically different outcomes. We formulate a stochastic program to determine the number of agents needed in the second stage as well as the proportion of customers that should be selected for each IVR service mode under different demand levels with the objective of minimizing the total staffing and abandonment costs. We also propose dynamic control policies to achieve the optimal proportions without the knowledge of the exact arrival rate.

Flight delays have been attributed to several causes such as weather conditions, airport congestion, airspace congestion, use of smaller aircraft by airlines, etc. In this paper, we examine the impact of the scheduled block time allocated for a flight, a factor controlled by airlines, on on-time arrival performance. We analyze empirical flight data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to estimate the scheduled on-time arrival probability of each commercial domestic flight flown in the United States in 2007 by a major carrier. The structural estimation approach from econometrics is then used to impute the overage to underage cost ratio of the newsvendor model for each flight. Our results show that airlines systematically \u201cunderemphasize\u201d flight delays, i.e., the flight delay costs implied by the newsvendor model are less than the implied costs of early arrivals for a large fraction of flights. Our results indicate that revenue drivers (e.g., average fare) and competitive measures (e.g., market share) have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. We also show that the scheduled on-time arrival probability is not positively affected by the total number of passengers on the aircraft rotation who could be affected by a flight delay, or the number of incoming and outgoing connecting passengers on a flight. Operational characteristics such as the hub and spoke network structure also have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. Finally, full-service airlines put a higher weight on the cost of late arrivals than do low-cost carriers, and flying on the lowest fare flight on a route results in a drop in the scheduled on-time arrival probability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0379","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of airline operations and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2012","14","3","Alex RoubosAlex Roubosa.roubos@vu.nlDepartment of Mathematics, VU University Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The NetherlandsSearch for more papers by this author, Ger KooleGer Kooleger.koole@vu.nlDepartment of Mathematics, VU University Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The NetherlandsSearch for more papers by this author, Raik StolletzRaik Stolletzstolletz@bwl.uni-mannheim.deBusiness School, University of Mannheim, 68131 Mannheim, GermanySearch for more papers by this author","Service-Level Variability of Inbound Call Centers","In practice, call center service levels are reported over periods of finite length that are usually no longer than 24 hours.

A central element of such a model is its underlying operating policy. We focus on network contracts for the transport capacity of natural gas pipelines, specific energy conversion assets. Practitioners commonly manage these contracts as portfolios of spread options. Although computationally fast, we show that this approach in general is heuristic because of the suboptimality of its operating policy. We propose a different computationally efficient real option approach based on an optimal operating policy, integrating linear optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. We use our approach to benchmark the spread option approach in a numerical study based on market data and realistic instances. We find that our approach can substantially improve on the contract valuations computed by the spread option approach, especially for contracts with flexibility in their allowed capacity usage. We also show that the optimal operating policy of contracts with this flexibility is of the greedy type, whereas the one of contracts without it in general is not. However, we observe that greedy optimization yields a near-optimal operating policy for the latter type of contracts with a substantially reduced computational effort. A version of our model was recently implemented by a major international energy trading company. Our model can also be employed to efficiently estimate the contract value sensitivities (the \u201cGreeks\u201d), which merchants use for financial hedging purposes. Potentially, our work has wider significance for the merchant management of other commodity conversion assets with payoffs determined by solving capacity constrained optimization models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0383","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of real option models and optimization in the context of natural gas pipeline transport, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Energy storage operations typically face limited operational flexibility characterized by the speed of storing and releasing energy, which makes the optimal policy, in general, difficult to compute. A widely used practice-based heuristic, the rolling intrinsic (RI) policy, generally performs well compared with an optimal policy but can significantly underperform in some cases. In this paper, we aim to understand the gap between the RI policy and the optimal policy and leverage the resulting insights to improve the RI policy. A new heuristic policy, the price-adjusted rolling intrinsic (PARI) policy, is developed based on theoretical analysis of storage options. This heuristic adjusts certain prices before applying the RI policy to provide the RI policy with estimates of the values of various storage options.

In this context, we explore the trade-off between improving demand forecast and increasing ordering cost. We show that the optimal ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy and analytically characterize that the base-stock level depends on the information state in a linear (log-linear) fashion for additive (multiplicative) MMFE.

Clinical quality measures hospitals' performance on patient safety, i.e., adherence to standards, whereas experiential quality relates to patient centeredness, i.e., responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the patient. Drawing from the organizational learning literature, we argue for a trade-off between clinical and experiential quality as hospitals emphasize process management. We also study how external and internal forces, i.e., state legislation and hospital leadership, influence this relationship. A combination of primary data and secondary data collected at various time intervals is employed to test our hypotheses. Four important implications emerge from this work. First, we find that hospitals' emphasis on process management is associated with an increase in clinical quality but a decrease in experiential quality. Second, we find that state legislation initially reinforces this trade-off but, overtime, facilitates a positive impact of process management on both quality outcomes. Third, a post hoc analysis suggests that a specific type of hospital leadership, namely, patient-centered leadership, helps mitigate the negative association between process management and experiential quality. Finally, our research provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between clinical quality and patient satisfaction contingent on experiential quality.

We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0380","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of workflow optimization in a medical facility without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0381","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['clinical workflows', 'information systems', 'patient types']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of healthcare service systems and workflow optimization, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we investigate the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience. We open up the black box of the volume-outcome relationship by going beyond just dividing experience into focal and related categories, but also considering how subtasks and context (i.e., the organization in which the work takes place) affect performance. To understand these issues, we assemble a novel data set on 71 cardiothoracic surgeons who performed more than 6,500 procedures during a period of 10 years after the introduction of a breakthrough surgical procedure. We find that, as compared to related experience, surgeon focal experience has a greater effect on surgeon performance. We also demonstrate that subtask experience has different, nonlinear performance relationships for focal and related experience. Finally, we find that focal experience is more firm specific than related experience and that nonfirm experience reduces the learning rate for both focal and related experience.

The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal\u2013agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an M/D/1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0402","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['patient access', 'performance-based', 'contracting']","The article discusses performance-based contracting in healthcare, which touches on patient access-to-care requirements.

Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit\u2014the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 1.7% on average, and as much as 5.5%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply\u2013demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3.63% on average and as much as 13.01%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low.

The resulting mixed-integer pricing problem is solved exactly and efficiently using a dynamic program that exploits certain \u201cextremal\u201d characteristics of the pricing problem. The formulation is tightened by using the problem's boundary conditions in preprocessing and to restrict the set of columns that are produced by the pricing problem. Branching schemes and cuts are introduced that can be implemented efficiently and that preserve the structure of the pricing problem. Some of the cuts are inspired by the capacity cuts known for the vehicle-routing problem, whereas others specifically target fractional solutions brought about by individual vessels \u201ccompeting\u201d for limited inventory at load ports and limited storage capacity at discharge ports.

Upon arrival, a job is routed to the queue of one of the servers. Finding a routing policy that minimizes the total workload in the system is a known difficult problem in general. Even if the optimal policy is identified, the policy would require the full queue length information at the arrival of each job; for example, the join-the-shortest-queue policy (which is known to be optimal for identical servers with exponentially distributed service times) would require comparing the queue lengths of all the servers. In this paper, we consider a balanced routing policy that examines only a subset of c servers, with 1 \u2264 c \u2264 K: specifically, upon the arrival of a job, choose a subset of c servers with a probability proportional to their service rates, and then route the job to the one with the shortest queue among the c chosen servers. Under such a balanced policy, we derive the diffusion limits of the queue length processes and the workload processes. We note that the diffusion limits are the same for these processes regardless the choice of c, as long as c \u2265 2. We further show that the proposed balanced routing policy for any fixed c \u2265 2 is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it minimizes the workload over all time in the diffusion limit. In addition, the policy helps to distribute work among all the servers evenly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0998","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to routing policies in parallel server systems, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For univariate marginals, this bound was first proposed by Meilijson and Nadas [Meilijson, I., A. Nadas. 1979. Convex majorization with an application to the length of critical path. J. Appl. Probab.16(3) 671\u2013677]. We generalize the bound to nonoverlapping multivariate marginals using multiple-choice integer programming. New instances of polynomial-time computable bounds are identified for discrete distributions. For the problem of selecting up to M items out of a set of N items of maximum total weight, the multivariate marginal bound is shown to be computable in polynomial time, when the size of each subset in the partition is O(log N). For an activity-on-arc PERT network, the partition is naturally defined by subsets of incoming arcs into nodes. The multivariate marginal bound on expected project duration is shown to be computable in time polynomial in the maximum number of scenarios for any subset and the size of the network. As an application, a polynomial-time solvable two-stage stochastic program for project crashing is identified. An important feature of the bound developed in this paper is that it is exactly achievable by a joint distribution, unlike many of the existing bounds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.1005","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of combinatorial optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we study possible loss incurred on ignoring correlations through a distributionally robust stochastic programming model, and we quantify that loss as price of correlations (POC). Using techniques of cost sharing from game theory, we identify a wide class of problems for which POC has a small upper bound. To our interest, this class will include many stochastic convex programs, uncapacitated facility location, Steiner tree, and submodular functions, suggesting that the intuitive approach of assuming independent distribution acceptably approximates the robust model for these stochastic optimization problems. Additionally, we demonstrate hardness of bounding POC via examples of subadditive and supermodular functions that have large POC.

The model combines a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model with a nonhomogeneous Poisson model of arrivals over multiple periods. Our key idea is to view the problem in terms of primary (or first-choice) demand; that is, the demand that would have been observed if all products had been available in all periods. We then apply the expectation-maximization (EM) method to this model, and we treat the observed demand as an incomplete observation of primary demand. This leads to an efficient, iterative procedure for estimating the parameters of the model.

The application that motivates this paper concerns the planning of single-product pickups over time; each site accumulates stock at a deterministic rate; the stock is emptied on each visit. At the tactical planning stage considered here, the objective is to minimize a surrogate measure of routing cost while achieving some form of regional clustering by partitioning the sites between the vehicles. The fleet size is given but can potentially be reduced. Planning consists of assigning customers to vehicles in each time period, but the routing, i.e., the actual sequence in which vehicles visit customers, is considered an \u201coperational\u201d decision. The planning is due to be repeated over the time horizon with constrained periodicity. We develop a truncated branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm combined with rounding and local search heuristics that yield both primal solutions and dual bounds. On a large-scale industrial test problem (with close to 6,000 customer visits to schedule), we obtain a solution within 6.25% deviation from the optimal to our model. A rough comparison between an operational routing resulting from our tactical solution and the industrial practice shows a 10% decrease in the number of vehicles as well as in the travel distance. The key to the success of the approach is the use of a state-space relaxation technique in formulating the master program to avoid the symmetry in time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.1015","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization of inventory routing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The airline can sell its cargo capacity either through allotment contracts or on the spot market, where customers exhibit choice behavior between different flights. The goal is to simultaneously select allotment contracts among available bids and find a booking control policy for the spot market to maximize the sum of the profit from the allotments and the total expected profit from the spot market. We formulate the booking control problem on the spot market as a dynamic program and construct approximations to its value functions, which can be used to estimate the total expected profit from the spot market. We show that our value function approximations provide upper bounds on the optimal total expected profit from the spot market, and they allow us to solve the allotment selection problem through a sequence of linear mixed-integer programs with a special structure. Furthermore, the value function approximations are useful for constructing a booking control policy for the spot market with desirable monotonic properties.

Our main result is that in the case of heterogeneous exponential multiserver systems, this regime gives rise to new limit processes for the sojourn time.

The signal processing algorithm identifies sound intensity peaks associated with diver breathing and outputs a diver number measuring the likelihood of diver presence, whereas the diver detection test aggregates the diver numbers obtained from the hydrophones in a linear statistic and optimizes the statistic's coefficients and a detection threshold for each noise scenario. The serial dependence of the diver numbers on a short time scale (several detection periods) is modeled by a hidden Markov chain, and finding the worst-case diver's trajectory for each hydrophone placement and noise scenario is reduced to a linear programming problem.

Both the retailer and supplier are capital constrained and in need of short-term financing. In the presence of bankruptcy risks for both the retailer and supplier, we model their strategic interaction as a Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader. We use the supplier early payment discount scheme as a decision framework to analyze all decisions involved in optimally structuring the trade credit contract (discounted wholesale price if paying early, financing rate if delaying payment) from the supplier's perspective. Under mild assumptions we conclude that a risk-neutral supplier should always finance the retailer at rates less than or equal to the risk-free rate. The retailer, if offered an optimally structured trade credit contract, will always prefer supplier financing to bank financing. Furthermore, under optimal trade credit contracts, both the supplier's profit and supply chain efficiency improve, and the retailer might improve his profits relative to under bank financing (or equivalently, a rich retailer under wholesale price contracts), depending on his current \u201cwealth\u201d (working capital and collateral).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1040","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain financing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such programs restrict attention to approximations that are lower bounds to the optimal cost-to-go function. Our program\u2014the \u201csmoothed approximate linear program\u201d\u2014is distinct from such approaches and relaxes the restriction to lower bounding approximations in an appropriate fashion while remaining computationally tractable. Doing so appears to have several advantages: First, we demonstrate bounds on the quality of approximation to the optimal cost-to-go function afforded by our approach. These bounds are, in general, no worse than those available for extant LP approaches and for specific problem instances can be shown to be arbitrarily stronger. Second, experiments with our approach on a pair of challenging problems (the game of Tetris and a queueing network control problem) show that the approach outperforms the existing LP approach (which has previously been shown to be competitive with several ADP algorithms) by a substantial margin.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1044","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical advancement in dynamic programming without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this paper, we introduce two habit-forming, correlation-averse preference models. With these preferences, we find closed-form solutions to the classic consumption and portfolio planning problem. Our solutions recommend that a correlation-averse decision maker follow a habit in their consumption plans.

Production scheduling consists of deciding which blocks should be extracted, when they should be extracted, and what to do with the blocks once they are extracted. Blocks that are close to the surface should be extracted first, and capacity constraints limit the production in each time period. Since the 1960s, it has been known that this problem can be cast as an integer programming model. However, the large size of some real instances (3\u201310 million blocks, 15\u201320 time periods) has made these models impractical for use in real planning applications, thus leading to the use of numerous heuristic methods. In this article we study a well-known integer programming formulation of the problem that we refer to as C-PIT. We propose a new decomposition method for solving the linear programming relaxation (LP) of C-PIT when there is a single capacity constraint per time period. This algorithm is based on exploiting the structure of the precedence-constrained knapsack problem and runs in O (mn log n) in which n is the number of blocks and m a function of the precedence relationships in the mine. Our computations show that we can solve, in minutes, the LP relaxation of real-sized mine-planning applications with up to five million blocks and 20 time periods. Combining this with a quick rounding algorithm based on topological sorting, we obtain integer feasible solutions to the more general problem where multiple capacity constraints per time period are considered. Our implementation obtains solutions within 6% of optimality in seconds. A second heuristic step, based on local search, allows us to find solutions within 3% in one hour on all instances considered. For most instances, we obtain solutions within 1\u20132% of optimality if we let this heuristic run longer. Previous methods have been able to tackle only instances with up to 150,000 blocks and 15 time periods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1050","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for production scheduling in mining, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

In short, they do not capture the magnitude of violation of the bounds. This paper addresses precisely this topic, focusing on linear constraints and ellipsoidal (Gaussian-like) uncertainties. We show that the problem of requiring different probabilistic guarantees at each level of constraint violation can be reformulated as a semi-infinite optimization problem. We provide conditions that guarantee polynomial-time solvability of the resulting semi-infinite formulation. We show further that this resulting problem is what has been called a comprehensive robust optimization problem in the literature. As a byproduct, we provide tight probabilistic bounds for comprehensive robust optimization.

In particular, we investigate the optimal ordering policies under three fixed cost structures. The first structure is motivated by transportation and production contracts and considers two fixed costs: if the order size is within a specified limit C, then the fixed cost is K1; otherwise, it is K2, where K1 \u227c K2. The second structure contains multiple fixed costs in which the same incremental fixed cost K is incurred for any additional order quantity up to a given identical batch capacity C. In the third structure, in addition to the K incurred as in the previous case, a common fixed cost is charged for any nonzero order size. An example of the former case arises when an order is shipped with a homogeneous fleet of trucks with per-truck fixed costs. A situation in which a fixed administrative cost plus a quantity-dependent trucking cost is incurred for each shipment exemplifies the latter case. For the first cost structure, we separate the analysis according to the conditions (1) K1 \u227c K2 \u227c 2K1 and (2) K1 \u227c K2. Under condition (1), we introduce a new concept called C-(K1, K2)-convexity, which enables us to almost completely characterize the optimal ordering policy. Under the general condition (2), we utilize a modified notion to provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy and propose a heuristic policy that performs well under a wide variety of model parameters. For the second cost structure, we show that it is optimal to order an integer multiple of the batch capacity to raise the inventory level to a specified range or band of length C, and then to order an additional full or partial batch size depending on the cost function, with no ordering required above the band. We also characterize a similar optimal policy for the third cost structure. Using different techniques, our study extends or redevelops several existing results in the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.1033","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control systems and cost structures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For centralized single-item systems with backlogs, the multilevel rationing (MR) policy is established as optimal and the strict priority (SP) policy is a practical compromise, balancing cost and ease of implementation. However, the optimal policy is unknown when service time is general, i.e., for M/G/1 queues. Dynamic programming, the tool commonly used to investigate the MR policy in make-to-stock queues, is less practical when service time is general. In this paper we focus on customer composition: the proportion of customers of each class to the total number of customers in the queue. We do so because the number of customers in M/G/1 queues is invariant for any nonidling and nonanticipating policy. To characterize customer composition, we consider a series of two-priority M/G/1 queues where the first service time in each busy period is different from standard service times, i.e., this first service time is exceptional. We characterize the required exceptional first service times and the exact solution of such queues. From our results, we derive the optimal cost and control for the MR and SP policies for M/G/1 make-to-stock queues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1062","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of make-to-stock queues without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The objective is to find an assortment that maximizes the worst-case expected revenue over all parameter values in the uncertainty set. We consider both static and dynamic settings. The static setting ignores inventory consideration, whereas in the dynamic setting, there is a limited initial inventory that must be allocated over time. We give a complete characterization of the optimal policy in both settings, show that it can be computed efficiently, and derive operational insights. We also propose a family of uncertainty sets that enables the decision maker to control the trade-off between increasing the average revenue and protecting against the worst-case scenario. Numerical experiments show that our robust approach, combined with our proposed family of uncertainty sets, is especially beneficial when there is significant uncertainty in the parameter values.

The trade-off between medical urgency and efficiency is at the heart of the liver allocation problem.

We consider the bicriteria objective of minimizing total number of patient deaths while waiting for transplantation (NPDWT) and maximizing total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) through a weighted combination. On one hand, under the objective of minimizing NPDWT, the current policy of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) emerges as the optimal policy, providing a theoretical justification for the current practice. On the other hand, under the metric of maximizing QALYs, the optimal policy is an intuitive dynamic index policy that ranks patients based on their marginal benefit from transplantation, i.e., the difference in benefit with versus without transplantation. Finally, we perform a detailed simulation study to compare the performances of our proposed policies and the current UNOS policy along the following metrics: total QALYs, NPDWT, number of patient deaths after transplantation, number of total patient deaths, and number of wasted livers.

The release time scheduling and hub location problem aims to select a specified number of hubs from a fixed set of demand centers, to allocate each demand center to a hub, and to decide on the release times of trucks from each demand center in such a way that the total amount of cargo guaranteed to be delivered to every potential destination by the next day is not below a threshold and the total routing cost is minimized. The paper introduces integer programming models to solve this problem in the special cases when the cargo uniformly arrives to each demand center during the day and the more realistic pattern of when the cargo arrivals exhibit a piecewise linear form. Several classes of valid inequalities are proposed to strengthen the formulations. Extensions with multiple service levels and discrete sets for release times are also discussed.

A key feature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network effect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the usage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's optimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents who have a central position in the underlying network. Our results can be summarized as follows. First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized prices and derive a characterization of the optimal price for each consumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it is optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that consists of three components: (i) a nominal term that is independent of the network structure, (ii) a discount term proportional to the influence that this agent exerts over the rest of the social network (quantified by the agent's Bonacich centrality), and (iii) a markup term proportional to the influence that the network exerts on the agent. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist who can only choose a single uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the number of agents to compute such a price. Third, we assume that the monopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and we study the problem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We show that the problem is NP-hard; however, we provide an explicit characterization of the set of agents who should be offered the discounted price. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set of agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price allocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit. Finally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits of a monopolist who does not take into account the network effects when choosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist who uses this information optimally.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1066","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['network effects', 'discounts', 'social network']","The article focuses primarily on pricing strategies and technical aspects of monopolistic behavior within social networks, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we study dynamic assortment decisions in a horizontally differentiated product category for which consumers' diverse tastes can be represented as locations on a Hotelling line. We presume that the firm knows all possible consumer locations, comprising a finite set, but does not know their probability distribution. We model this problem as a discrete-time dynamic program; each period, the firm chooses an assortment and sets prices to maximize the total expected profit over a finite horizon, given its subjective beliefs over consumer tastes. The consumers then choose a product from the assortment that maximizes their own utility. The firm observes sales, which provide censored information on consumer tastes, and it updates beliefs in a Bayesian fashion. There is a recurring trade-off between the immediate profits from sales in the current period (exploitation) and the informational gains to be exploited in all future periods (exploration). We show that one can (partially) order assortments based on their information content and that in any given period the optimal assortment cannot be less informative than the myopically optimal assortment. This result is akin to the well-known \u201cstock more\u201d result in censored newsvendor problems with the newsvendor learning about demand through sales when lost sales are not observable. We demonstrate that it can be optimal for the firm to alternate between exploration and exploitation, and even offer assortments that lead to losses in the current period in order to gain information on consumer tastes. We also develop a Bayesian conjugate model that reduces the state space of the dynamic program and study value of learning using this conjugate model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1067","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['diverse tastes', 'consumer', 'assortment']","The article discusses consumer diversity in tastes, but the primary focus is on profit maximization and technical modeling rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

Calls are first routed to an in-house (or dedicated) service station that has a finite waiting room. If the waiting room is full, the call is overflowed to an outside provider (an overflow station) that might also be serving overflows from other stations. We establish approximations for overflow networks with many servers under a resource-pooling assumption that stipulates, in our context, that the fraction of overflowed calls is nonnegligible. Our two main results are (i) an approximation for the overflow processes via limit theorems and (ii) asymptotic independence between each of the in-house stations and the overflow station. In particular, we show that, as the system becomes large, the dependency between each in-house station and the overflow station becomes negligible. Independence between stations in overflow networks is assumed in the literature on call centers, and we provide a rigorous support for those useful heuristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1070","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of call center outsourcing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our modeling framework is descriptive in nature as it features certain plausible approximations that are commonly employed in practical inventory systems. The results are nonetheless compelling and can be used to explain various conflicting observations in previous empirical studies. Building on the theoretical framework, we discuss the managerial implications of the bullwhip measurement. We show that the measurement can be completely noninformative about the underlying supply chain cost performance if it is not linked to the operational details (such as decision intervals and leadtimes). Specifically, we show that an aggregated measurement over relatively long time periods can mask the operational-level bullwhip.

To ration these resources, patients are assigned different priority levels, a process that is called triage. According to triage protocols in place, each patient's priority level is determined based on that patient's injuries only. However, recent work from the emergency medicine literature suggests that when determining priorities, resource limitations and the scale of the event should also be taken into account in order to do the greatest good for the greatest number. This article investigates how this can be done and what the potential benefits would be. We formulate the problem as a priority assignment problem in a clearing system with multiple classes of impatient jobs. Jobs are classified based on their lifetime (i.e., their tolerance for wait), service time, and reward distributions. Our objective is to maximize the expected total reward, e.g., the expected total number of survivors. Using sample-path methods and stochastic dynamic programming, we identify conditions under which the state information is not needed for prioritization decisions. In the absence of these conditions, we partially characterize the optimal policy, which is possibly state dependent, and we propose a number of heuristic policies. By means of a numerical study, we demonstrate that simple state-dependent policies that prioritize less urgent jobs when the total number of jobs is large perform well, especially when jobs are time-critical.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1075","","OR","Multidisciplinary","4","['greatest good', 'resource limitations', 'priority levels']","The article discusses the ethical considerations of resource allocation in emergency situations, emphasizing the need to consider broader societal impacts beyond just patient injuries.

Although mammography is the most effective modality for breast cancer screening, it has several potential risks, including high false-positive rates. Therefore, the balance of benefits and risks, which depend on personal characteristics, is critical in designing a mammography screening schedule. In contrast to prior research and existing guidelines that consider population-based screening recommendations, we propose a personalized mammography screening policy based on the prior screening history and personal risk characteristics of women. We formulate a finite-horizon, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for this problem. Our POMDP model incorporates two methods of detection (self or screen), age-specific unobservable disease progression, and age-specific mammography test characteristics. We solve this POMDP optimally after setting transition probabilities to values estimated from a validated microsimulation model. Additional published data is used to specify other model inputs such as sensitivity and specificity of test results. Our results show that our proposed personalized screening schedules outperform the existing guidelines with respect to the total expected quality-adjusted life years, while significantly decreasing the number of mammograms and false-positives. We also report the lifetime risk of developing undetected invasive cancer associated with each screening scenario.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.1019","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['personalized', 'risk characteristics', 'screening']","The article discusses personalized screening based on individual risk characteristics, which hints at a consideration for patient-centered care.

Because of long manufacturing lead time, the supplier orders its entire stock for the season well in advance. The retailers, on the other hand, can replenish their inventory from the supplier throughout the season as demand realizes. Demand at each retailer follows a Poisson process. Each retailer order incurs a fixed cost, and the usual understocking and overstocking costs occur. When retailer lead time is negligible, we show that it is optimal for the retailer to follow a time-based, order-up-to policy and order only when inventory is depleted. We also characterize the structure of the optimal policy and propose a number of heuristics for easier computation. For the supplier, we express the distribution of total demand. This allows the supplier to solve a classic newsvendor problem to determine the total stock for the season. We find that the optimal retailer policy can sometimes cause large demand variation for the supplier, resulting in lower supplier profit. In centralized settings, this may even result in lower system profit than some na\u00efve retailer heuristics, creating inefficiency in the supply chain.

Prior exact solution techniques either rely on cutting planes or the transformation of the CARP into a node-routing problem. The drawbacks are either models with inherent symmetry, dense underlying networks, or a formulation where edge flows in a potential solution do not allow the reconstruction of unique CARP tours. The proposed algorithm circumvents all these drawbacks by taking the beneficial ingredients from existing CARP methods and combining them in a new way. The first step is the solution of the one-index formulation of the CARP in order to produce strong cuts and an excellent lower bound. It is known that this bound is typically stronger than relaxations of a pure set-partitioning CARP model. Such a set-partitioning master program results from a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. In the second phase, the master program is initialized with the strong cuts, CARP tours are iteratively generated by a pricing procedure, and branching is required to produce integer solutions. This is a cut-first bap-second algorithm and its main function is, in fact, the splitting of edge flows into unique CARP tours.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1079","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical algorithm for solving a specific operational problem without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Districts often are required to satisfy some legal constraints, but these typically are not very restrictive, allowing decision makers to influence the composition of these districts without violating relevant laws. For example, while districts must often comprise a single contiguous area, a vast collection of acceptable solutions (i.e., sets of districts) remains. Choosing the best set of districts from this collection can be treated as a (planar) graph partitioning problem. When districts must be contiguous, successfully solving this problem requires an efficient computational method for evaluating contiguity constraints; common methods for assessing contiguity can require significant computation as the problem size grows. This paper introduces the geo-graph, a new graph model that ameliorates the computational burdens associated with enforcing contiguity constraints in planar graph partitioning when each vertex corresponds to a particular region of the plane. Through planar graph duality, the geo-graph provides a scale-invariant method for enforcing contiguity constraints in local search. Furthermore, geo-graphs allow district holes (which typically are considered undesirable) to be rigorously and efficiently integrated into the partitioning process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1083","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['political representation', 'districting', 'constraints']","The article discusses political districting and its implications for representation, which touches on themes of governance and fairness; however, it primarily focuses on technical solutions rather than social justice or equity, resulting in a low woke score."],["2012","60","5","Ba\u015fak Kalkanc\u0131Ba\u015fak Kalkanc\u0131kalkanci@mit.eduEngineering Systems Division, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139Search for more papers by this author, Feryal ErhunFeryal Erhunferhun@stanford.eduManagement Science and Engineering Department, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Search for more papers by this author","Pricing Games and Impact of Private Demand Information in Decentralized Assembly Systems","This paper analyzes decentralized assembly systems under asymmetric demand information and sequential contracting.

We identify the conditions under which each supplier benefits from such an equilibrium. (2) Eliminating information asymmetry is not always beneficial for the suppliers because obtaining information might bring only marginal value and hence might not be realistically justified. Furthermore, a downstream supplier might prefer information asymmetry to complete information, especially when demand variability is moderate.

We describe USCG modifications to the model recommendations due to practicalities not captured by our model. Finally, we present the significant improvements to USCG quantitative performance metrics that resulted from our model's recommendations. These include a considerable reduction of excess capacity and boat shortages at the stations, a decrease in the overall fleet size with a simultaneous increase in boat utilization, and overall reduction of the fleet operating cost.

This problem consists of selecting the location of processes, the assignment of products, and the distribution of production quantities to markets in order to minimize total expected costs. It differs from the traditional facility location problem due to characteristics that are inherent to process industry sectors. These include significant economies of scale at high volumes, large switchover times, and production yield uncertainty. We model the problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer program. A challenging aspect of this problem is that the objective function is neither convex nor concave. We develop an exact approach to linearize the objective function. We present heuristics to solve the problem and also construct lower bounds based on a reduction of the constraint set to evaluate the quality of the solutions. This framework has been used to make process choice and product allocation decisions at the food processing company, and the estimated annual cost savings are around 10%, or $50 million. In addition, the insights from the model have had a significant strategic and organizational impact at this company.

One approach that has attracted attention and experimentation in the emergency medicine community is a system in which ED beds and care teams are segregated and patients are \u201cstreamed\u201d based on predictions of whether they will be discharged or admitted to the hospital. In this paper, we use a combination of analytic and simulation models to determine whether such a streaming policy can improve ED performance, where it is most likely to be effective, and how it should be implemented for maximum performance. Our results suggest that the concept of streaming can indeed improve patient flow, but only in some situations. First, ED resources must be shared across streams rather than physically separated. This leads us to propose a new \u201cvirtual-streaming\u201d patient flow design for EDs. Second, this type of streaming is most effective in EDs with (1) a high percentage of admitted patients, (2) longer care times for admitted patients than discharged patients, (3) a high day-to-day variation in the percentage of admitted patients, (4) long patient boarding times (e.g., caused by hospital \u201cbed-block\u201d), and (5) high average physician utilization.

Our approach involves exploiting the properties of the primal mathematical programming formulation and of the dual variables and linking those properties to the concept of convex orders and to properties of the underlying demand function. The use of convex orders allows us to establish our main results without restriction to a specific demand distribution. A major strength of our approach is that it is \u201cscalable,\u201d i.e., it applies to newsvendor networks with any number of \u201cnonindependent\u201d (i.e., demand or resource sharing) products and resources, without an exponential increase in effort as problem size increases. This is unlike the current approaches commonly used in the operations management literature, which typically involve a parametric analysis of the recourse problem, followed by the use of Jacobians and the implicit function theorem. Providing a rigorous framework for comparative statics analysis, which can be applied to other problems that are not amenable to traditional parametric analysis, is our main contribution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1097","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of multiproduct newsvendor networks without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Since it was formulated (more than 50 years ago), the problem has incorporated additional industrial factors and constraints while its solution methods have been constantly improving in terms of the solution quality and CPU times. However, despite all the efforts made, the available solution methods (including those for a popular model based on the p-median problem, PMP) are prone to two major types of errors. The first error (the modeling one) occurs when the intended objective function of the CF (as a rule, verbally formulated) is substituted by the objective function of the PMP. The second error (the algorithmic one) occurs as a direct result of applying a heuristic for solving the PMP. In this paper we show that for instances that make sense in practice, the modeling error induced by the PMP is negligible. We exclude the algorithmic error completely by solving the adjusted pseudo-Boolean formulation of the PMP exactly, which takes less than one second on a general-purpose PC and software. Our experimental study shows that the PMP-based model produces high-quality cells and in most cases outperforms several contemporary approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1108","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cell formation in industrial engineering without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Given a univariate function whose domain consists of n distinct values, it begins by employing a base-2 expansion to express the function in terms of the ceiling of log2n binary and n continuous variables, using linear restrictions to equate the functional values with the possible binary realizations. The representation of the product of such a function with a nonnegative variable is handled via an appropriate scaling of the linear restrictions. Products of m functions are treated in an inductive manner from i = 2 to m, where each step i uses such a scaling to express the product of function i and a nonnegative variable denoting a translated version of the product of functions 1 through i \u2212 1 as a newly defined variable. The resulting representations, both in terms of one function and many, are important for reformulating general discrete variables as binary, and also for linearizing mixed-integer generalized geometric and discrete nonlinear programs, where it is desired to economize on the number of binary variables. The approach provides insight into, improves upon, and subsumes related linearization methods for products of functions of discrete variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1106","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to mathematical functions without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We consider N stochastic arrival streams that may wait in N queues before being processed by one of many resources (technologies) that differ in their flexibility.

This allows us to sharpen \u201ca little flexibility is all you need\u201d: the asymptotically optimal flexibility configuration for symmetric systems with mild economies of scope invests a lot in specialized resources but only a little in flexible resources and only in level-2 flexibility, but effectively nothing (o(\u221a\u03bb)) in level-k > 2 flexibility.

The third party announces the time slots available on her facility, and the associated prices. Manufacturers reserve, on a first-come-first-book basis, time slots that they desire to utilize. Booking of overtime is possible, at a higher cost. A job completed after its due date incurs a tardiness cost. Each manufacturer books chunks of facility time and sequences his jobs over the time slots booked to minimize his booking, overtime, and tardiness costs. This model captures the main features of outsourcing operations in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, biotechnology, and drug R&D. In current practice, the third party executes all outsourced jobs without performing optimization and coordination. We investigate the issue of the third party serving as a coordinator to create a win\u2013win solution for all. We propose a model based on a cooperative game as follows: (i) Upon receiving the booking requests from the manufacturers, the third party derives an optimal solution if manufacturers cooperate, and computes the savings achieved. (ii) She devises a savings sharing scheme so that, in monetary terms, every manufacturer is better off to coordinate than to act independently or coalesce with a subgroup of manufacturers. (iii) For her work, the third party withholds a portion \u03c1 of the booking revenue paid by the manufacturers for time slots that are released after coordination.

To that end, we developed deterministic models that partitioned tax forms into development groups and determined staffing levels for each group. Partitioning forms into groups simplified workflow management and staffing decisions. To provide a range of resource configurations, we used two modeling approaches.

In this paper, we provide a new perspective. The key insight is to replace the statistical framework in the original approach with ideas from inverse optimization. This insight allows us to significantly expand the scope and applicability of the BL model. We provide a richer formulation that, unlike the original model, is flexible enough to incorporate investor information on volatility and market dynamics. Equally importantly, our approach allows us to move beyond the traditional mean-variance paradigm of the original model and construct \u201cBL\u201d-type estimators for more general notions of risk such as coherent risk measures. Computationally, we introduce and study two new \u201cBL\u201d-type estimators and their corresponding portfolios: a mean variance inverse optimization (MV-IO) portfolio and a robust mean variance inverse optimization (RMV-IO) portfolio. These two approaches are motivated by ideas from arbitrage pricing theory and volatility uncertainty. Using numerical simulation and historical backtesting, we show that both methods often demonstrate a better risk-reward trade-off than their BL counterparts and are more robust to incorrect investor views.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1115","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical advancements in asset allocation models without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

Previous research shows that the optimal policies in models with random yields (even in models with a single installation) lack the familiar order-up-to structure and are not myopic.  Thus, dynamic programming algorithms are needed to compute optimal policies, and one encounters the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d; this is exacerbated here by the need to expand the size and dimension of the state space to accommodate the autoregressive demand feature.  Nevertheless, although our model is more complex, we prove that there is an optimal policy with the order-up-to feature and, more importantly, that the optimal policy is myopic. This avoids the computational burden of dynamic programming.  Our results depend on two assumptions concerning the stochastic yield, namely that the expected yield at a work station is proportional to the lot size, and the distribution of the deviation of the yield from its mean does not depend on the lot size. We introduce the concept of echelon-like variables, a generalization of Clark and Scarf's classical concept of echelon variables, to derive the structure of optimal policies. Furthermore, we show that the same kind of policy is optimal for several criteria: infinite-horizon discounted cost, infinite-horizon long-run average cost, and finite-horizon discounted cost (with the appropriate choice of the salvage value function).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1119","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of lot-sizing policies in manufacturing and inventory systems without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The methodology is based on the integration of the stochastic programming and combinatorial pattern recognition fields. It permits the fast solution of stochastic optimization problems in which the random variables are represented by an extremely large number of scenarios. The method involves the binarization of the probability distribution and the generation of a consistent partially defined Boolean function (pdBf) representing the combination (F,p) of the binarized probability distribution F and the enforced probability level p. We show that the pdBf representing (F,p) can be compactly extended as a disjunctive normal form (DNF). The DNF is a collection of combinatorial p-patterns, each defining sufficient conditions for a probabilistic constraint to hold. We propose two linear programming formulations for the generation of p-patterns that can be subsequently used to derive a linear programming inner approximation of the original stochastic problem. A formulation allowing for the concurrent generation of a p-pattern and the solution of the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic problem is also proposed. The number of binary variables included in the deterministic equivalent formulation is not an increasing function of the number of scenarios used to represent uncertainty. Results show that large-scale stochastic problems, in which up to 50,000 scenarios are used to describe the stochastic variables, can be consistently solved to optimality within a few seconds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1120","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for optimization problems without any reference to social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Discussions of inter-industry diversification typically focus on producer synergies obtainable from economies of scope or from skill transfer across business units. Discussions of intra-industry product diversification\u2014generally, the province of marketing\u2014typically focus on synergies obtainable from product bundling, which lowers producer costs or provides convenience for consumers. We take a different tack by linking interindustry diversification and consumer utility. We first separately examine two possible consumer benefits of interindustry diversification: (1) facilitating consumers' accomplishment of two tasks simultaneously or (2) attracting diverse consumer groups to a common platform when intergroup externalities exist. We then assess a simple empirical context that shows potential for simultaneous consumer utilities and two-sided market utility together. We analyze this context and concurrently develop a mathematical model showing how these demand-side synergies can create unique business value. We next introduce asymmetric preferences among consumer subgroups, and we refine our arguments by comparing their conclusions with the empirical data. We learn that combinations of otherwise mundane (i.e., commonplace) assets can create consumer value\u2014\u201csuperior\u201d assets are not necessary. Moreover, common ownership is necessary for the pricing flexibility required to deliver (and capture) maximum value through interindustry diversification, especially when consumer groups' preferences may change; the negotiations and settling up required for cooperation through alliances will, without common ownership, increase costs and reduce responsiveness. We discuss the sustainability of demand-side advantages and the implications of these ideas for future research and practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0627","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['diverse consumer groups', 'consumer utility', 'sustainability']","The article discusses the attraction of diverse consumer groups and the implications of consumer utility, indicating a moderate focus on social considerations alongside traditional business metrics.

This question is central to the resource-based view, and the answer depends not only on the direct returns on investment in each capability but also on the trade-offs in using those returns for future growth or survival in a competitive market. Through simulation experiments, this study examines firm-level capability development trade-offs in the context of a firm's market-level competition and growth. It is found that investing in operational capabilities (which enhance short-term performance) gains priority over investing in long-term dynamic capabilities when the operational capability investment strengthens the reinforcing loop between performance, investment flow, and capability development. Such operational capability investment provides growth opportunities and competitive advantage. Moreover, in strategic competition, firms anticipating rivals' focus on short-term growth need to further ignore dynamic (long-term) capability building in order to survive. Testable propositions are offered as to how trade-offs between short-term and long-term investments depend on different firm and industry characteristics. The results may explain why short-term-focused firm behavior persists in firms even in the absence of discounting, short-term managerial incentives, decision biases, or learning failures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0628","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on operational capabilities and competitive advantage without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Drawing from prior turnaround research, we identify several prominent forms of CEO fit/misfit that are especially germane to troubled firms.

Given how busy most managers are, and how much information their subordinates receive on a daily basis, this practice seems, initially, quite puzzling. We conducted an ethnographic investigation to examine the nature of events that compelled managers to engage in redundant communication. Our study of the communication patterns of project managers in six companies across three industries indicates that redundant communication is a response to unexpected endogenous or exogenous threats to meeting work goals. Managers used two distinct forms of redundant communication to mobilize team members toward mitigating potentially threatening discrepant events\u2014unforeseen disruptive occurrences during the regular course of work. Managers with positional power over team members reactively followed up on a single communication when their attempt to communicate the existence of a threatening discrepant event failed, and they determined that a second communication was needed to enable its joint interpretation and to gain buy-in.

The causes of these deviations are behavioral factors that bound firms' ability to pursue and compete for superior opportunities. Because these bounds are systematic and diffused among firms, they ensure that latent opportunities are not competed away. In this setting, the behavioral bases of superior performance stem from a superior ability to overcome focal behavioral bounds. This analytical structure is used to identify the mental processes especially important to firm performance that strategic leaders can reliably manage. Its key insight is that superior opportunities are cognitively distant. They rarely correspond to common ways of thinking. The reason for this is that it is necessary to overcome strong behavioral bounds to pursue these opportunities. This insight contrasts with mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy, which focus on the virtues of local action, and it has two implications: the behavioral essence of superior performance corresponds to strategic leaders' superior ability to manage the mental processes necessary to pursue cognitively distant opportunities; and pursuing the cognitively distant implies a more expansive conception of strategic agency (e.g., the role of strategic leaders) than is acknowledged by mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy. The challenges posed by this conception require a model of human cognition that goes beyond the understanding of bounded rationality that is diffused in current behavioral strategy research. The second part of the paper assesses the traits of a model of human mind that can support the behavioral conception of strategic agency advocated and proposes a unified model of the human mind that centers on associative processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0644","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['behavioral', 'performance', 'strategic agency']","The article primarily focuses on behavioral aspects of strategy and performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In this paper, we examine direct and indirect agency risks associated with providing middle and operational managers with autonomy in the hopes of encouraging CE. The key ideas behind our discussion involve two dilemmas of CE. (1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors. (2) Although the generation of new ideas to explore new strategic directions and/or opportunities is important, the very newness of the ideas make them difficult to evaluate, and thus the selection process may be perceived as unfair by some managers. We propose that (a) stock options, (b) passive monitoring, and (c) perceived procedural justice would attenuate the negative side effects associated with CE, such as opportunistic behaviors and perceived unfairness. Although research in CE often stresses autonomy of middle and operational managers for new idea generation as important, examining the whole process in terms of idea generation, selection, and implementation with respect to potential risks will extend the CE literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0645","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['autonomy', 'agency', 'fairness', 'justice']","The article discusses themes of autonomy and perceived procedural justice, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations and fairness in the context of corporate entrepreneurship.

Organizations, however, could not establish similar patterns among their customers, who, lacking connections with other routine participants, expected consistency and performed their part less flexibly.

I use inductive theorizing to make a distinction between interpersonal networking actions aimed at adding new contacts (network-broadening actions) versus managing existing contacts (network-deepening actions). I reason that because networking actions alter the cost-benefit calculus of using referrals, the extent to which entrepreneurs rely on referrals when searching for new exchange partners should vary with their networking actions. I then propose that entrepreneurs are likely to add fewer new exchange partners when they rely more on referrals to search. The empirical analysis employs a longitudinal design using data coded from the business cards of new contacts formed over a two-month period by a panel of Indian entrepreneurs operating business-to-business ventures. This study makes a theoretical contribution by identifying decision makers' networking style as a distinct mechanism shaping partner selection for their organization. Specifically, the study shows entrepreneurs using more network-deepening actions initiate fewer new economic exchanges, due (in part) to their increased reliance on referral-based search, whereas entrepreneurs using more network-broadening actions initiate more new economic exchanges due (in part) to their decreased reliance on referral-based search.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0567","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['networking', 'interorganizational', 'entrepreneurs']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of networking styles among entrepreneurs and their impact on economic exchanges, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although conventional wisdom suggests that horizontal ties between producers are driven solely by their prior interactions, we find that vertical ties drive the formation of horizontal relationships in a multiplex triad.

This dual analytical lens helps establish that, in competitive and information-intensive settings, a small-world system could be a highly dynamic structure that follows an inverted U-shaped evolutionary pattern, wherein an increase in the small-worldliness of the system is followed by its later decline as a result of three factors: (1) the recursive relationship between the evolving social structure and individual actors' formation of bridging ties, which eventually homogenizes the information space and decreases actors' propensity to form bridging ties, creating a globally separated network; (2) self-containment of the small-world network, or increasing homogenization of the social system, which makes the small world less accepting of and less attractive to new actors, thereby limiting formation of bridging ties to outside clusters; and (3) fragmentation of the small-world network, or the small-world system's inability to retain current clusters.

The Moderating Influence of Perceived Upward Mobility on the Relationship Between Blended Workgroups and Employee Attitudes and Behaviors","This study attempts to reconcile previous findings that show both positive and negative outcomes associated with blended workgroups (i.e., workgroups consisting of both temporary and standard workers). Specifically, we conceptualize temporary and standard work as part of a naturally occurring status hierarchy in organizations and propose that blended workgroups have opposing effects on employees depending on employees' perceptions of their potential for upward mobility in that organization. We combine research on the blended workforce with theorizing from social identity and self-categorization theories to propose that when employees perceive the potential for upward mobility to be high, the proportion of temporary workers in the group will be negatively related to employee attitudes and behaviors, and the relationship will be positive when perceived mobility is low. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this relationship will be mediated by the valence of employees' perceptions of their workgroup's prototype. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 124 temporary and standard research scientists in an Australian organization. The results show that workgroup composition and perceived mobility jointly influence workgroup identification and organization-based self-esteem, mediated by the valence of workgroup prototype; however, workgroup composition and perceived mobility directly influence organizational citizenship behavior unmediated by prototype valence.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0606","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['upward mobility', 'temporary workers', 'employee attitudes', 'workgroup identification']","The article addresses themes of perceived upward mobility and its impact on employee attitudes within blended workgroups, suggesting a focus on equity in workplace dynamics.

Whereas previous research has shown that bridging ties have high decay rates and short-term effects, we explore the possibility that bridging ties may produce benefits over an extended period of time. In particular, we contrast the conventional view of bridging ties having rapidly decaying effects with two alternative network dynamics suggesting \u201caccumulating\u201d and \u201cimprinting\u201d effects. We propose that bridging ties have accumulating effects as a result of learning and redeployment of cumulated knowledge. We also predict that bridging ties exhibit an imprinted effect whereby the founding conditions surrounding the formation of some, but not all, ties yield long-lasting network benefits. We test our theory in the context of Nashville's legal industry, studying the formation and evolution of the professional network of lawyers' coemployment ties between 1933 and 1978. Consistent with our theory, we find that bridging ties produce network benefits over an extended period of time and trace back to the point of tie formation. Surprisingly, we also find that the imprinted effect is more robust than the rapidly decaying effect of bridging ties.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0633","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['network', 'organizational outcomes', 'bridging ties']","The article primarily focuses on organizational dynamics and network effects without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The concepts of potential and latent tie are deductively identified, and their implications for understanding how and why networks emerge, evolve, and change are explored. A longitudinal empirical study conducted with companies operating in the European motorsport industry reveals that firms take strategic actions to search for potential ties and reactivate latent ties in order to solve problems of network redundancy and overload. Examples are given, and their characteristics are examined to provide theoretical elaboration of the relationship between the types of tie and network evolution. These conceptual and empirical insights move understanding of the managerial challenge of building effective networks beyond static structural contingency models of optimal network forms to highlight the processes and capabilities of dynamic relationship building and network development. In so doing, this paper highlights the interrelationship between search and redundancy and the scope for strategic action alongside path dependence and structural influences on network processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0634","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['networks', 'strategic actions', 'dynamic relationship building']","The article primarily focuses on network dynamics and strategic actions within organizations, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Status as an Asset vs. Status as a Liability in the PGA and NASCAR","Two competing predictions about the effect of status on performance appear in the organizational theory and sociological literatures. On one hand, various researchers have asserted that status improves performance. This line of work emphasizes tangible and intangible resources that accrue to occupants of high-status positions and therefore pictures status as an asset. On the other hand, a second stream of research argues that status instead diminishes performance. This alternative line of work emphasizes complacency and distraction as deleterious processes that plague occupants of high-status positions and thus portrays status as a liability. Which of these two perspectives best characterizes the actual performance of individuals in a competitive setting? And are they in any way reconcilable? In this paper, we summarize these two perspectives and test them in two empirical settings: the Professional Golf Association (PGA) and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). Using panel data on the PGA Tour, we model golfers' strokes from par in each competition as a function of their status in the sport. Using similar data on NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, we model drivers' speed in the qualifying round as a function of their status in the sport. We find curvilinear effects of status in both contexts. Performance improves with status until a very high level of status is reached, after which performance wanes. This result not only concurs with the view that status brings tangible and intangible resources but also provides empirical support for the contention that status fosters dispositions and behaviors that ultimately erode performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0679","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['status', 'performance', 'asset', 'liability']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between status and performance in competitive sports, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

In this paper, I contribute to this discussion by performing a qualitative case study investigating the accounts employees provide as they make sense of their identification with their workgroup, organization, and profession. Analyses of accounts from 31 members of an architecture firm reveal nine explanations individuals use to make sense of their identifications, which can be categorized using four sensemaking logics: similarity, familiarity, benefits, and investment. The explanations that informants provided differed markedly across targets. Whereas individuals relied heavily on personal relationships, and that their work actually happens in their workgroup in their accounts of workgroup identification, organizational identification was often explained based on the ideology of the organization, the support provided by the organization, the prestige of the organization, and the input the individual had into the organization. In further contrast, accounts of professional identification rested on explanations based in professional archetypes, the enjoyment informants found in their work, and professional norms about the work/life interface. These findings suggest that individuals may construct their identifications differently across targets. I theorize that these patterns are a function of target proximity and the characteristics that distinguish between targets. These findings open up the black box of identification by providing insight into how individuals interpret information about workplace targets. In doing so, the findings illustrate how sensemaking about identification is the result of firsthand experiences with a target in addition to sensegiving.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0654","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identification', 'sensemaking', 'organizational', 'workgroup', 'professional']","The article discusses employee identification and sensemaking within organizations, which touches on themes of organizational culture and employee experiences.

We analyze the product and organizational architectures of three firms in the air conditioning industry through an original data set of 100 components and supply relationships. Applying a variety of regression methods, we show that, under the condition of product architecture stability at the component level, supplier relations for loosely coupled components are characterized by less information sharing, which implies that the degree of coupling of product components varies directly with the degree of coupling of organizations (the \u201cmirroring\u201d hypothesis). Also, the performance of supply relationships depends on the amount of buyer\u2013supplier information sharing but not on the degree of component modularity, which supports the relational view and confirms that product modularity does not have unambiguous effects on organizational performance. Moreover, the degree of component modularity negatively moderates the impact of buyer\u2013supplier information sharing on supplier-relationship performance, which confirms that component modularity works as an ex ante, embedded substitute for high-powered interorganizational integration mechanisms. Finally, contingent on firms' strategies, organizational structures, and capabilities, we argue that at the firm level, higher product modularity may be associated either with less information sharing with suppliers, which implies that the mirroring effect might hold also at the firm level, or with more information sharing with suppliers, which implies that there may be increasing returns to modularity in design efforts because of interorganizational integration (the \u201ccomplementarity\u201d hypothesis).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0655","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product modularity and organizational relations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Nevertheless, contrary to prior research that has underscored the merits of collaboration, we identify an optimal level of collaboration beyond which collaboration undermines both processes. Furthermore, the availability of internal resources can either complement or substitute for collaboration depending on the level of collaboration. In particular, we find that availability of internal resources mitigates the effect of academic collaboration on knowledge creation when collaboration is moderate and complements it as collaboration becomes excessive. Thus, our study reveals the contingent value of collaboration and the interplay between internal and network resources.

Yet resistance is still seen as an adversarial and antagonistic process that management can accept or reject; thus, understanding how resistance can actually influence workplace change remains a challenge for research. In this paper, we offer an analysis of two situations of resistance wherein resisters, organized in temporary enclaves, are able to influence top management's decisions and produce eventual change. Whether or not resistance becomes productive depends on the skillful work of resisters and the creation of powerful \u201cobjects of resistance\u201d that enable resisters to modify temporarily the power configuration of a situation and oblige top management to listen to their claims and accommodate to the new configuration.

Reaching beyond the usual domain of organizational and management research, we leverage findings from law and economics to offer a novel organizational perspective on litigation and private dispute resolution, and we develop hypotheses about the likelihood of litigation in different exchange settings. Our empirical analysis generates three sets of new findings: First, counter to the received wisdom, we see that the involvement of lawyers does not necessarily signal the bitter end of an exchange relationship, because firms frequently manage to avoid litigation and resolve their disputes privately, and they do so in a manner that accords with our theoretical predictions. Second, we see that familiarity with exchange partners does not automatically lead to increased willingness to work things out; rather, our empirical results suggest that the impact of exchange duration on parties' willingness to resolve disputes privately is contingent on the development of norms of cooperation: in the event that such norms do not develop, the probability of a litigated outcome actually increases over time. Finally, we see that firms' willingness to work things out privately is also influenced positively by the shadow of the future. These findings are suggestive of a \u201cdiscriminating alignment\u201d between exchange characteristics and the choice of dispute resolution procedure, and they thus inject important new evidence into ongoing discussions about the legal underpinnings of different governance forms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0658","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['dispute resolution', 'litigation', 'exchange relationships']","The article primarily focuses on legal and economic aspects of dispute resolution in business contexts, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

It builds on the idea that reciprocal interdependence among team members creates the potential for complementarity. Complementarity, in turn, translates into higher firm surplus. The division of this surplus is subject to bargaining between the firm owner and labor. We argue that when complementarity increases, the firm owner's share of surplus will grow if interdependence among team members is symmetric. Furthermore, we identify three levers that make complementarity amenable to managerial design: the nature of interaction among team members, the relative dominance of team members, and the composition of a team. We find that greater interaction among team members and higher recruitment of team-oriented individuals are associated with increased complementarity, whereas dominant team members are associated with reduced complementarity.

We hypothesize that the degree of physical isolation is negatively associated with virtual employees' perceived respect and that this relationship explains the lower organizational identification among more physically isolated virtual employees. In two field studies using survey methods, we find that perceived respect is negatively associated with the degree of physical isolation, and respect mediates the relationship between physical isolation and organizational identification. These effects hold for shorter- and longer-tenured employees alike.

Using longitudinal, multilevel data collected from a large federal government agency implementing radical organizational change, we extend extant research related to antecedents of commitment to change by examining how employees' hierarchical distance (the number of reporting levels between an employee and the top management team) and the transformational leadership of their direct (immediate) manager both relate to their ACC and NCC. We also shed light on important mechanisms that explain these two relationships by examining the mediating role of employees' perceived effectiveness of top management's change-related communications (TMCs), including the top-down and bottom-up components of TMC. Taking advantage of a longitudinal field design, we tested these antecedents of commitment to change at Time 1 and the longitudinal effects of the Time 1 predictors on commitment to change 12 months later (Time 2). At Time 1, findings supported both the predicted direct and mediated effects. Hierarchical distance and perceived TMC remained significant predictors of ACC and NCC over a one-year follow-up period; however, direct managers' transformational leadership behaviors did not. The study extends previous findings related to antecedents of employee commitment to change and also shows the interplay between different levels of leadership in shaping employee affective and normative commitment to radical organizational change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0662","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['commitment', 'transformational leadership', 'organizational change', 'hierarchical distance']","The article discusses themes of employee commitment and transformational leadership, which relate to organizational ethics and employee engagement.

A pluralist approach highlights that objects perform at least three types of work in this context: they motivate collaboration, they allow participants to work across different types of boundaries, and they constitute the fundamental infrastructure of the activity. Building on the results of an empirical study, we illustrate the insights that each theoretical lens affords into practices of collaboration and develop a novel analytical framework that organizes objects according to the active work they perform.

We contribute to this emerging literature by studying institutional targeting between specialized and general-purpose tribunals, which are available to resolve disputes in a number of settings. Whereas prior work on institutional targeting has primarily focused on the differences in the policy preferences of public actors and the susceptibility of policy positions to influence activities, we focus on the differences in expertise and procedural flexibility that typically accompany tribunal specialization. We develop a theory about targeting decisions (forum shopping) in such contexts, which suggests two main drivers of tribunal targeting\u2014expected settlement and expected returns. Drawing on these mechanisms, we formulate hypotheses linking tribunal targeting decisions to firm-level attributes such as (market) strategic stakes, institutional distance from competitors, and tribunal-specific capabilities.

We theoretically elaborate the role of rhetoric in exploiting strategic ambiguity, based on analysis of a longitudinal case study of an internationalization strategy within a business school. Our data show that actors use rhetoric to construct three types of strategic ambiguity: protective ambiguity that appeals to common values in order to protect particular interests, invitational ambiguity that appeals to common values in order to invite participation in particular actions, and adaptive ambiguity that enables the temporary adoption of specific values in order to appeal to a particular audience at one point in time. These rhetorical constructions of ambiguity follow a processual pattern that shapes the emergent process of strategic action. Our findings show that (1) the strategic actions that emerge are shaped by the way actors construct and exploit ambiguity, (2) the ambiguity intrinsic to the action is analytically distinct from ambiguity that is constructed and exploited by actors, and (3) ambiguity construction shifts over time to accommodate the emerging pattern of actions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0670","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['ambiguity', 'values', 'strategic action']","The article discusses the role of rhetoric and ambiguity in strategic actions, which touches on the importance of values in decision-making.

Governance structure is a well-understood knowledge protection strategy designed to reduce knowledge leakage concerns and thereby encourage desired knowledge transfers in two-party R&D alliances. Whether governance structure can be an important balancing mechanism for R&D alliances with multiple partner firms, or multilateral R&D alliances, however, requires further study. Because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral R&D alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. Drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral R&D alliances. First, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral R&D alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. Results based on our analysis of 2,423 R&D alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory. We next focus on three-partner R&D alliances, or trilateral R&D alliances, and compare governance mechanisms between two types of trilateral R&D alliances: chain and net. We find that equity governance structures are more likely to be used in net-based than in chain-based trilateral R&D alliances; we also find that alliance scope moderates the relationship between the type of alliance and governance structure. Finally, we find that multilateral R&D alliances with predicted (aligned) governance structures perform better, in terms of alliance longevity, than those with misaligned structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0671","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['governance', 'knowledge sharing', 'equity']","The article discusses governance structures in R&D alliances, which touches on the theme of equity in governance mechanisms.

We test our model using longitudinal, fine-grained data on commercial banks undertaking more than 1,300 opportunity choices. The findings show that firms do use the opportunity prospects rule when exercising market expansion choices and that slack and performance feedback moderate the effects of opportunity prospects. This paper contributes to organizational decision-making research and to the behavioral view of the firm by showing the importance of considering an opportunity-driven approach, by demonstrating the relevance of simplifying rules to explain the search for the consequences of alternatives, by extending recent efforts to provide a more forward-looking perspective to model organization behavior, and by showing when slack and performance feedback moderate the effects on market expansion of the opportunity prospects rule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0674","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational decision-making and market expansion without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One approach in the literature for overcoming these difficulties, which we refer to as the traverse approach, is for team members to identify, elaborate, and then explicitly confront the differences and dependencies across the knowledge boundaries. This approach emphasizes deep dialogue and requires significant resources and time. In an exploratory in-depth longitudinal study of three quite different cross-functional teams, we found that the teams were able to cogenerate a solution without needing to identify, elaborate, and confront differences and dependencies between the specialty areas. Our analysis of the extensive team data collected over time surfaced practices that minimized members' differences during the problem-solving process. We suggest that these practices helped the team to transcend knowledge differences rather than traverse them. Characteristic of these practices is that they avoided interpersonal conflict, fostered the rapid cocreation of intermediate scaffolds, encouraged continued creative engagement and flexibility to repeatedly modify solution ideas, and fostered personal responsibility for translating personal knowledge to collective knowledge. The contrast between these two approaches to knowledge integration\u2014traverse versus transcend\u2014suggests the need for more nuanced theorizing about the use of boundary objects, the nature of dialogue, and the role of organizational embeddedness in understanding how knowledge differences are integrated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0677","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['knowledge differences', 'dialogue', 'collaboration']","The article discusses the integration of knowledge differences within teams, emphasizing dialogue and collaboration, which aligns with moderate woke themes of inclusivity and teamwork.

Building on contact theory, this paper proposes that direct contact affords a flow of knowledge that counters tendencies to social conformity. Network dissolution differs from network formation in that partners have already obtained direct information. As a result, network dissolution is not as responsive to fads and fashions as network formation, and network structures induced by fads and fashions often survive beyond the life cycle of a fashion. An analysis of the interlocking ties of S&P 1500 firms with Internet companies from 1996 to 2006 supports the view that fads and fashions have asymmetric effects on the evolution of networks and also shows that (1) fads and fashions have a strong impact on the formation of networks but not on their dissolution, (2) the networking behaviors of organizations with direct contact are less induced by fads and fashions, and (3) the networks formed by organizations with direct contact during the heyday of a fashion survive longer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0683","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['network', 'fads', 'social conformity']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of network evolution and does not emphasize social justice or ethical critiques.

This paper, in contrast, emphasizes the role of scientific publications in firms' battles for market dominance and examines how competitive conditions shape firms' propensities to publish scientific articles about their innovations. Focusing on the context of pharmaceutical drugs, we develop propositions about how the competition that one drug faces from similar drugs and potential substitutes influences the innovating firm's inclination to publish articles in the top medical journals about that drug to facilitate its assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the medical community. We also propose that scientific articles about competing drugs compel a firm to highlight its own drug in scientific papers to assert the drug's uniqueness and mitigate the threat of substitution. Whereas prior research has elucidated how science contributes to enhancing firms' competence at creating innovations, which is critical to their ability to compete in technology-intensive environments, this paper draws attention to how competition, in turn, permeates into the scientific arena, creating inducements for firms to use scientific publications to position their innovations in the marketplace.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0684","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['competition', 'scientific publications', 'market dominance']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between technological competition and scientific publications, with an emphasis on market dynamics rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

How Social Accounts Create vs. Merely Explain Unfavorable Pay Outcomes for Women","Two studies examined how managers' pay decisions for male and female employees are affected by the opportunity to provide social accounts and how managers think about the value of accounts for men versus women. I theorized that managers would treat social accounts as substitutes for pay for women but not for men, paradoxically leading managers who could behave more procedurally fairly to create gender-based distributive injustice. Study 1 confirms this hypothesis. Practicing managers who learned before making pay decisions that they could provide a social account\u2014here, an explanation of circumstances justifying low raises\u2014paid women less than men and less than women for whom they could not provide this account. Also as hypothesized, when an account was available, experienced managers paid women less than did inexperienced managers. In addition to pay decisions, participants' explicit beliefs about the value of accounts as substitutes for pay (Study 1) and in motivating male and female employees (Study 2) were examined. When participants expected the account to make the employee feel that he or she had been treated with a high level of procedural fairness (Study 1), or the language of the account explicitly acknowledged and apologized for unfair treatment (Study 2), participants assumed that the account would be significantly more valuable for women than for men.

To isolate causal effects, I exploit changes in the software labor market. Consistent with past theory, I find a tight link between the number of producers on platform and the number of software varieties that were generated. The patterns indicate the link is closely related to the diversity and distinct specializations of producers. Also highlighting the role of heterogeneity and nonrandom entry and sorting, later cohorts generated less compelling software than earlier cohorts. Adding producers to a platform also shaped investment incentives in ways that were consistent with a tension between network effects and competitive crowding, alternately increasing or decreasing innovation incentives depending on whether apps were differentiated or close substitutes. The crowding of similar apps dominated in this case; the average effect of adding producers on innovation incentives was negative. Overall, adding large numbers of producers led innovation to become more dependent on population-level diversity, variation, and experimentation\u2014while drawing less on the heroic efforts of any one individual innovator.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0678","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['diversity', 'heterogeneity', 'innovation', 'specializations']","The article discusses the importance of diversity and heterogeneity among app developers, which aligns with moderate woke themes of DEI in innovation.

We describe an inductive, grounded theory project, based on 20 case studies, that looks into the conditions under which people who make things keep their work open to accident, the degree to which they rely on accidents in their work, and how they incorporate accidents into their deliberate processes and arranged surroundings. By comparing makers working in varied conditions, we identify specific factors (e.g., technologies, characteristics of technologies) that appear to support accidental innovation. We show that makers in certain specified conditions not only remain open to accident but also intentionally design their processes and surroundings to invite and exploit valuable accidents. Based on these findings, we offer advice for the design of digital systems to support innovation processes that can access valuable unpredictability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0681","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['innovation', 'accidents', 'digital systems']","The article discusses innovation processes and the role of unpredictability, but it does not emphasize social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find support for our predictions that transaction hazards, decomposed as either enduring or transient over the stages of industry evolution, are positively associated with the choice to internalize value chain activities. Pre-entry experience in an activity increases the likelihood of its internalization and reduces the effect of enduring transaction hazards on the internalization choice. Importantly, we also distinguish between firm- and founder-level pre-entry capabilities (that is, the capabilities of firms versus those of founders). Diversifying entrants with firm-level integrative capabilities are more likely to internalize value chain activities than start-ups, and this effect persists over the industry's life cycle. The relationship between pre-entry experience with an activity and the likelihood of internalizing it is also stronger for diversifying entrants.

We consider how firms are organized in terms of both division of labor and division of knowledge. We categorize product innovations according to whether they are enabled by changes in components or by changes in architectures. We test our predictions in the context of the global dynamic random access memory industry from 1974 to 2005, during which it transitioned through 12 distinct product generations. We find that vertically integrated firms had, on average, a faster time to market for new product generations than nonintegrated firms. The performance benefit that firms derived from vertical integration was greater when the new product generation was enabled by architectural change than when it was enabled by component change. We also find that although many nonintegrated firms extended their knowledge boundaries by developing knowledge of outsourced components, the performance benefits from such knowledge mostly accrued to \u201cfully nonintegrated\u201d firms (i.e., those that did not vertically integrate into any upstream component), rather than \u201cpartially integrated\u201d firms (i.e., those that vertically integrated into some components but not others).

We argue that transacting parties create value not only through the employment of partner-specific investment and coordination activities but also through the employment of heterogeneous, firm-specific resources that each firm brings to the relationship and that, in turn, governance structures reflect a discriminating alignment with these two distinct forms of value-creating activities and resources. Our thesis is empirically tested in the context of industrial original equipment manufacturers employing branded component contracts with independent component vendors. Specifically, we investigate the conditions under which the price terms for branded components are agreed upon (more fixed) ex ante versus negotiated (more flexible) ex post. Our results offer two insights. First, the chosen governance form reflects a trade-off between safeguarding and adaptation motives even among parties engaged in cooperative relationships. Second, valuable, firm-specific resources that preexist outside of the exchange relationship are at stake in these cooperative yet contractually incomplete relationships.

We interviewed 85 scientists and managers working on drug discovery to understand how they deal with complexity. We find a major knowledge fault line between digital scientists, who use computers as laboratories and manipulate signs, and therapy scientists, who use conventional laboratories and manipulate physical material. We build on research on epistemic cultures and knowing in practice to develop empirically grounded theory for the role of digital science in complex innovation. We propose that digitalization creates a new form of knowledge that provides essential complementary insights for complex innovation that cannot exist otherwise. However, digitalization also creates new knowledge boundaries that concern central activities of innovation.

We draw on semiotics to distinguish among three types of virtual work (virtual teams, remote control, and simulations) based on what it is that a technology makes virtual and whether work is done with oron, through, or within representations. Of the three types, simulations have been least studied, yet they have the greatest potential to change work's historically tight coupling to physical objects. Through a case study of an automobile manufacturer, we show how digital simulation technologies prompted a shift from symbolic to iconic representation of vehicle performance. The increasing verisimilitude of iconic simulation models altered workers' dependence on each other and on physical objects, leading management to confound operating within representations with operating with oron representations. With this mistaken understanding, and lured by the virtual, managers organized simulation work in virtual teams, thereby distancing workers from the physical referents of their models and making it difficult to empirically validate models. From this case study, we draw implications for the study of virtual work by examining how changes to work organization vary by type of virtual work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0703","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['diversity', 'virtual teams', 'implications']","The article mentions 'diversity' in the context of virtual work, indicating a moderate engagement with socially progressive themes.

Much of organizational scholarship holds that accompanying a shift toward increasingly modular product structures, component suppliers are engaging in relatively more design and invention around the components that they supply. We find that the evolution of digital controls may reverse this pattern, because in the wake of a major shift in the digital controls technology, suppliers actually engage in relatively less component innovation in comparison with their large manufacturing customers. To explain this shift, we characterize complex product structures in terms of two distinct product hierarchies: the inclusionary and the digital control hierarchy. In using this distinction to analyze the evolution of automotive emission control systems from 1970 to 1998, we reconcile two competing views about the interfirm division of innovative labor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0707","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['digital control systems', 'innovation', 'automotive industry']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of digital innovation and its impact on labor division in the automotive industry, with no significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Following a review of conceptual fundamentals\u2014what capability is and why organizations differ in capability\u2014it assesses recent progress toward an integration of the capabilities and transaction cost approaches, primarily in the context of the analysis of vertical structure and related phenomena. This review suggests that progress has been substantial and that the key elements of a promising dynamic synthesis have been identified. The paper then considers issues that call for attention if further progress is to be achieved. The first of these is the role of agency, which must be seen in expansive terms (relative to standard economic rationality) if its evolutionary significance is to be fully appreciated. The second is the role of structure, or more specifically, industry architecture, which affects capability development by way of its effect on the feedback that firms receive. After drawing on the recent financial crisis for an illustration of these ideas, this paper considers the rise of interest in business models as a useful field of application, and it concludes with a discussion of the role of organizational economics (beyond TCE). We argue that, whatever the theoretical perspective at the level of the firm, analyses must reach beyond that level to grasp the important causal forces affecting capability development, firm boundaries, and structural features more generally.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0716","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['agency', 'structure', 'capability']","The article discusses concepts related to organizational capabilities and agency, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

The fundamental properties of digital technology are reprogrammability and data homogenization. Together, they provide an environment of open and flexible affordances that are used in creating innovations characterized by convergence and generativity. An analysis of convergence and generativity observed in innovations with pervasive digital technologies reveals three traits: (1) the importance of digital technology platforms, (2) the emergence of distributed innovations, and (3) the prevalence of combinatorial innovation. Each of the six articles in this special issue relates to one or more of these three traits. In this essay, we explore the organizational research implications of these three digital innovation traits and identify research opportunities for organization science scholars.

Combining field data from a global consulting firm with an agent-based model, we examine how efforts to supplement one's knowledge from coworkers interact with individual, organizational, and environmental characteristics to impact organizational performance. We find that once cost and interpersonal exchange are included in the analysis, the impact of knowledge transfer is highly contingent. Depending on specific characteristics and circumstances, knowledge transfer can better, matter little to, or even harm performance. Three illustrative studies clarify puzzling past results and offer specific boundary conditions: (1) At the individual level, better organizational support for employee learning diminishes the benefit of knowledge transfer for organizational performance. (2) At the organization level, broader access to organizational memory makes global knowledge transfer less beneficial to performance. (3) When the organizational environment becomes more turbulent, the organizational performance benefits of knowledge transfer decrease. The findings imply that organizations may forgo investments in both organizational memory and knowledge exchange, that wide-ranging knowledge exchange may be unimportant or even harmful for performance, and that organizations operating in turbulent environments may find that investment in knowledge exchange undermines performance rather than enhances it. At a time when practitioners are urged to make investments in facilitating knowledge transfer and collaboration, appreciation of the complex relationship between knowledge transfer and performance will help in reaping benefits while avoiding liabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0697","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge transfer', 'organizational support', 'performance']","The article discusses knowledge transfer and organizational support, which are relevant to workforce dynamics, but it primarily focuses on performance outcomes rather than social justice or equity themes.

This comparative case study of two hospitals demonstrates that implementing reform inside organizations may require internal reformers not only to mobilize with one another but also to stand up to internal defenders' countertactics in everyday encounters. Because reformer alliances across identity lines often require reformers with different statuses to collaborate with one another, defenders can divide reformer coalitions by linking reform practices to a status characteristic associated with lower-status reformers, denigrating higher-status reformers by associating them with these practices, and reintegrating higher-status reformers into the defender group. When status threat inside an organization is high to begin with, higher-status reformers are likely to be concerned about loss of privilege in the face of defenders' status-based countertactics and, in response, distance themselves from reform practices and align themselves with defenders to protect their identity and its rewards. This can undermine the multi-identity reformer coalition and cause change to fail.

Although the agency-based performative deviation path hinders successful practice transfer, the knowledge-based performative deviation path can actually be helpful to organizations.

To investigate how these two decisions interact with each other and influence supply chain performance, we develop a single\u2010period model with a supplier that provides a product to an original equipment manufacturer, which in turn sells it to customers. Customer demand is random and affected by the length of the product warranty period. Warranty costs are incurred by both the supplier and the manufacturer. We analyze two different scenarios based on which party sets the warranty period: manufacturer warranty and supplier warranty. Product quality is controlled by the supplier, and the manufacturer determines the ordering quantity. We analyze these decentralized systems and provide the structural properties of the equilibrium strategies. We also compare the results of centralized and decentralized systems and identify the conditions under which one system provides a longer warranty and better product quality than the other. Our numerical study further shows that, in decentralized settings, when the warranty period is determined by the firm sharing the larger proportion of total warranty costs, the supply chain can achieve greater system\u2010wide profit. Both parties can therefore benefit from properly delegating the warranty decision and sharing the resulting additional profit.

Yet, the assumption that remanufacturing is desirable to society has never been systematically investigated. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness and eco\u2010efficiency of remanufacturing in the personal computer and mobile phone industries. We investigate whether remanufacturing substantially reduces the environmental impact, as measured by cumulative energy demand (CED), generated over the life cycles (LCs) of these products, and the size of any reduction. We also examine the relative eco\u2010efficiency of remanufacturing compared with virgin manufacturing for these two products, where eco\u2010efficiency includes both willingness\u2010to\u2010pay (WTP) for the products as well as the energy consumed in producing the products. Our main findings are the following. One, remanufacturing is an effective way to reduce the total energy consumed during the LCs of personal computers and mobile phones, with one notable exception, when the life spans of remanufactured products are substantially shorter than the life spans of their new counterparts. Two, a remanufactured personal computer or mobile phone is not always more eco\u2010efficient than a corresponding new product. Three, the WTP for remanufactured personal computers and mobile phones, and consequently, their eco\u2010efficiencies, are a function of the prices of the correspondent new products at launch and years elapsed between launch and remanufacturing. Four, remanufactured units are sold at a discount relative to the price of new personal computers and mobile phones. Five, on the whole, the market for remanufactured mobile phones is more eco\u2010efficient than the market for new mobile phones. Six, the market for remanufactured computers is more eco\u2010efficient than the market for new computers. Lastly, because the group of remanufactured products is heterogeneous, not all remanufactured units are more eco\u2010efficient than the average new computer and mobile phone.

Two important phases involved in working with technology vendors are vendor selection and vendor management. Because for both steps theory development of key decision guidelines is still immature, we use detailed case studies of 31 innovation outsourcing projects at Siemens to develop grounded theory on provider selection criteria and on project management success drivers. A selection criterion often associated with successful outsourcing is the provider's \u201ctrack record\u201d or previous experience. Our cases suggest that there is no standard \u201ctrack record\u201d for success but that a \u201cmatch\u201d between the client firm's outsourcing motivation and the provider's strengths appears to be a necessary condition for a successful outsourcing collaboration. As to the second phase\u2014managing the vendor\u2014we identify a number of operational project success drivers. There seems to be no universal checklist, but the most important drivers seem to be contingent on the type of vendor chosen and on the maturity of the technology. We compare five provider types\u2014universities, competitors, customers, start\u2010up companies, and component suppliers\u2014and find that some success drivers are common to all providers, while others are relevant only for certain types of provider. Moreover, drivers in the case of a mature technology are more focused on successful transfer to manufacturing than on development itself.

Many studies demonstrated the potential benefit of using flexible capacity at the aggregate level by treating a whole plant or a whole process as a single stage. This paper extends these analyses by studying the benefits of flexible capacity while considering the multi\u2010stage structure of processes and consequently determining which stages should be flexible, which should be dedicated, and how much capacity to assign to each stage. We consider a two\u2010product firm which operates in a process\u2010to\u2010order environment and faces uncertain demand. Each stage of the process can be designed as dedicated or flexible. Dedicated resources are highly cost efficient but limited to the single product they are exclusively designed for, whereas flexible resources are versatile to handle several products but are more expensive. Using a general mathematical formulation our analysis shows that the optimal design may have some dedicated and some flexible stages along the process. Interestingly, this decision should be decoupled from the chronological order of the stages along the process.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01240.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management related to capacity utilization and cost efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To stimulate demand and enhance revenue, in some periods, the firm may choose to offer a part of its available inventory at a discount. As customers learn to expect such discounts, a fraction may wait rather than purchase at a regular price. A problem the firm faces is how to incorporate this waiting and learning into its revenue management decisions. To address this problem we summarize two types of learning behaviors and propose a general model that allows for both stochastic consumer demand and stochastic waiting. For the case with two customer classes, we develop a novel solution approach to the resulting dynamic program. We then examine two simplified models, where either the demand or the waiting behavior are deterministic, and present the solution in a closed form. We extend the model to incorporate three customer classes and discuss the effects of overselling the capacity and bumping customers. Through numerical simulations we study the value of offering end\u2010of\u2010period deals optimally and analyze how this value changes under different consumer behavior and demand scenarios.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01243.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Both modes are followed in practice. Firms should determine which is more profitable. We classify customers into two groups: lead time sensitive (LS) and price sensitive (PS). LS customers value lead time reduction more than PS customers. We develop mathematical models of both quotation modes and analyze them to determine the most profitable mode under specified situations as well as the best lead time and price quotations within each mode. We find that DQM is dominated by UQM whenever PS customers have positive utilities from UQM or LS customers have positive utilities from DQM. Otherwise, which quotation mode is better depends on multiple factors, such as customer characteristics (including lead time reduction valuation and product valuation of a customer, and the proportion of LS customers) and production characteristics (including the desired service level and service or production cost).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01248.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and lead time strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we study the potential use of two contingency strategies on top of the conventionally used time buffer\u2014statically planned safety lead\u2010time (SL)\u2014approach to deal with the lead\u2010time uncertainty. These are (1) the ex\u2010ante planning for disruption safety stock (DSS) to be released when a \u201cdisruption\u201d (in this case, late delivery of the order) occurs; and (2) the ex\u2010post dynamic emergency response (DER), which dynamically decides on the timing and size of an emergency order to be placed. Our work elaborates on the optimal parameter setting for these strategies, compares their added values when used to complement the traditional SL approach, and examines how the use of the contingency strategies affects the SL and corresponding cycle length of a periodic review system. Our research finds that: (1) the above contingency strategies reduce the reliance on the SL and are cost effective when the coefficient of variation (CV) of the uncertain lead\u2010time is high; (2) it is important to re\u2010optimize the SL to account for the contingency plans; and (3) re\u2010optimization of the cycle length to account for the presence of the contingency responses, as opposed to using an EOQ\u2010determined cycle length, does not significantly improve the cost performance.

In this article, we investigate for the optimal leasing price and leasing duration decisions by a monopolist when the production and servicing capacity are constrained. The effect of diffusion of consumers in the installed base is considered, with the ownership of the product resting with the monopolist during the product lifecycle. The monopolist operating the installed base jointly optimizes the profits from leasing the product/service bundle along with maintenance revenues and remanufacturing savings. We formulate the manufacturer's problem as an optimal control problem and show that the optimal pricing strategy of the firm should be a skimming strategy. We also find that the effect of remanufacturing savings on the pricing decision and the length of the leasing duration changes significantly depending on the duration of the product's lifecycle. If the product lifecycle is long and remanufacturing savings are low, the firm should offer a shorter leasing duration, whereas if the remanufacturing savings are high, the firm should optimally offer a higher leasing duration.

It arrives a transshipment time later, during which the stocked\u2010out retailer incurs backorder cost. Without transshipment, backorder cost is incurred until the next replenishment. Since the transshipment time is shorter than the time between two replenishments, transshipments can reduce the backorder cost at the stocked\u2010out retailer and the holding costs at the other retailer.

The transshipment policy is characterized by hold\u2010back inventory levels, which are nonincreasing in the remaining time until the next replenishment. The transshipment policy differs from those in the literature because we allow for multiple transshipments between replenishments, positive transshipment times, and backorder costs. We also discuss the challenges associated with positive replenishment time and develop upper and lower bounds of average cost in this case.

For the case of dual\u2010sourcing, we characterize the optimal parameter of the exponential score function, considering the impact of the buyer's decisions on the suppliers, and considering how the suppliers compete against each other to earn a portion of the buyer's demand. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium and characterize the equilibrium behavior of the system.

We present a case study of a producer of MTO offshore oil rigs that highlights the key aspects of the problem. The producer was faced with an increase in both demand and demand variability. Consequently, it had to rely heavily on subcontracting to handle production requirements that were in excess of its capacity.

We considered two key tactical parameters: the planning window of the master production schedule and the planned lead time of each workstation.

They are posited to be necessary for delivering effective B2B e\u2010services. We also argue that, both service orientation (SO) and customer receptivity to technology, influence B2B e\u2010service capability. We empirically test a path model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 181 businesses that have deployed B2B e\u2010services. We find that the influence of SO on performance is not direct but rather mediated by the e\u2010service capability, a finding that holds for both goods producers and service providers.

The firm under consideration replenishes a certain product from a set of capacitated suppliers for a price\u2010dependent demand in each period. Under deterministic capacities, we derive a multilevel base stock list price policy and establish the optimality of cost\u2010based supplier selection, that is, ordering from a cheaper source before more expensive ones. With general random capacities, however, neither result holds. While it is optimal to price low for a high inventory level, the optimal order quantities are not monotone with respect to the inventory level. In general, a near reorder\u2010point policy should be followed. Specifically, there is a reorder point for each supplier such that no order is issued to him when the inventory level is above this point and a positive order is placed almost everywhere when the inventory level is below this point. Under this policy, it may be profitable to order exclusively from the most expensive source. We characterize conditions under which a strict reorder\u2010point policy and a cost\u2010based supplier\u2010selection criterion become optimal. Moreover, we quantify the benefit from dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing, and the benefit from multiple sourcing, as opposed to single sourcing. We show that these two strategies exhibit a substitutable relationship. Dynamic pricing is less effective under multiple sourcing than under single sourcing, and supplier diversification is less valuable with price adjustments than without. Under limited supply, dynamic pricing yields a robust, long\u2010term profit improvement. The value of supply diversification, in contrast, mainly comes from added capacities and is most significant in the short run.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01266.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that production postponement and information sharing strategies may substitute, complement, or conflict with each other, depending on the extent of the increase in the unit production cost when production is postponed. In a two\u2010level supply chain, from the retailer's perspective, information sharing and production postponement can be beneficial or detrimental. When information sharing is beneficial to the retailer, the retailer always shares her demand information with the manufacturer voluntarily. In addition, this voluntary information sharing is truthful because inflated or deflated demand information hurts the retailer through a higher wholesale price or a stock\u2010out. However, the retailer never shares her demand information voluntarily if the manufacturer has already adopted production postponement because production postponement and information sharing strategies always conflict with each other. Even when the retailer does not benefit from information sharing, we show that the manufacturer can always design an incentive mechanism to induce the retailer to share the demand information, irrespective of whether the manufacturer has already implemented production postponement or not. The above findings underscore the need for a careful assessment of demand uncertainty\u2010reduction strategies before the supply chain players embark upon them.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01286.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical strategies for supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

At the beginning of a period, the retailer makes replenishment and pricing decisions, and at the end of a period, the retailer decides whether to dispose of ending inventory or carry it forward to the next period. The objective of the retailer is to maximize the long\u2010run average profit. Assuming zero lead time, we propose an efficient solution approach to the problem, which is also generalized to solve three extensions to the basic model. A feature of the present study is that we consider explicitly the influence of perishability on the demand. Among the insights gathered from the numerical analysis, we find that dynamic pricing aids extending shelf life and when disposal incurs a lower cost, or even a positive salvage value, the retailer is induced to dispose earlier since the benefit of selling new inventory offsets the loss due to disposal. We also observe that the faster the perceived rate of deterioration, the lower the threshold of the ending inventory for disposal. Perhaps a bit counter\u2010intuitive, maximizing profits does not mean eliminating disposals or expirations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01288.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory control for perishables, with an emphasis on maximizing profit.

Our results indicate that neither service provider will have both a faster service and a lower price than its competitor.

When price plays a significant role and the capacity costs at the service providers sufficiently differ, they will adopt substitutable competition instruments: the lower cost service provider will build a faster service and the higher cost service provider will charge a lower price. Comparing our results to those in the existing literature, we find that the service providers invest in lower service rates, engage in less intense price competition, and earn higher profits, while customers wait in line longer when they are unable to infer service rates and are naive in service selection than when they can infer service rates to make sophisticated choices.

We develop managerial insights by characterizing how to create operational hedges against the bankruptcy risk: if a startup makes a \u201cconservative\u201d investment decision, then it also selects an optimal quantity that is less than the monopoly level and hence sacrifices some of first period expected profits to increase its survival chances.

Workload control (WLC) accomplishes this in complex make\u2010to\u2010order job shops by controlling lead times, capacity, and work\u2010in\u2010process (WIP). However, the concept has been dismissed by many authors who believe its order release mechanism reduces the effectiveness of shop floor dispatching and increases work center idleness, thereby also increasing job tardiness results. We show that these problems have been overcome. A WLC order release method known as \u201cLUMS OR\u201d (Lancaster University Management School order release) combines continuous with periodic release, allowing the release of work to be triggered between periodic releases if a work center is starving. This paper refines the method based on the literature (creating \u201cLUMS COR\u201d [Lancaster University Management School corrected order release]) before comparing its performance against the best\u2010performing purely periodic and continuous release rules across a range of flow directions, from the pure job shop to the general flow shop. Results demonstrate that LUMS COR and the continuous WLC release methods consistently outperform purely periodic release and Constant WIP. LUMS COR is considered the best solution in practice due to its excellent performance and ease of implementation. Findings have significant implications for research and practice: throughput times and job tardiness results can be improved simultaneously and order release and dispatching rules can complement each other. Thus, WLC represents an effective means of implementing lean principles in a make\u2010to\u2010order context.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01307.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of workload control and lean manufacturing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition to random demand for the serviceable product and random returned quantities of different types of cores in each time period, the remanufacturing yield of each type of core is also uncertain. By analyzing a multi\u2010period stochastic dynamic program, we derive several properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy. In addition to some insights, these properties can be used to reduce the search effort of the optimal policy. We also demonstrate that some existing results derived from related models no longer hold in remanufacturing systems with random yield. Recognizing the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy is highly complex, we examine three simple heuristics that can be efficiently solved and implemented in practice. Among these three heuristics, our numerical analysis suggests that the heuristic that captures most of the yield uncertainty and future system evolvement as well as some of the properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy outperforms the other two heuristics.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01313.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of remanufacturing systems and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition to the OEM's product, the CM also produces for a smaller OEM. Both the larger OEM and the CM can purchase the component from the supplier, but their purchase prices may differ and remain unknown to each other. The main question we address is whether the larger OEM should retain component procurement by purchasing components from the supplier and reselling to the CM (buy\u2013sell), or outsource component procurement by letting the CM purchase directly from the supplier (turnkey). We show that, under buy\u2013sell, the larger OEM's optimal strategy is to resell components at the highest possible component purchase price of the CM (i.e., the street price). By comparing buy\u2013sell and turnkey, we find that a CM with low component price is better off under turnkey, even though under buy\u2013sell he receives more profits through the products sold to the smaller OEM. Furthermore, the larger OEM's preference between buy\u2013sell and turnkey depends on her component price, the volatility of the CM's component price and substitutability between the two products.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01325.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement strategies without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The model assumes that there are three sales components: the first is from consumers who have already committed to purchasing (or renting) a product (e.g., based on promotion of, or exposure to, the product prior to its launch); the second comes from consumers who are potential buyers of the product; and the third comes from either a networking effect on closely tied (as in a social group) potential buyers from previous buyers (in the case of movie rental and all retail products) or re\u2010rents (in the case of game rental). In addition, we explicitly formulate into our model dynamic interactions between these sales components, both within and across sales periods. This important feature is motivated by realism, and it significantly contributes to the accuracy of our model. The model is thoroughly tested against sales data for rental and retail products from Blockbuster. Our empirical results show that the model offers excellent fit to actual sales activity. We also demonstrate that the model is capable of delivering reasonable sales forecasts based solely on environmental data (e.g., theatrical sales, studio, genre, MPAA ratings, etc.) and actual first\u2010period sales. Accurate sales forecasts can lead to significant cost savings. In particular, it can improve the retail operations at Blockbuster by determining appropriate order quantities of products, which is critical in effective inventory management (i.e., it can reduce the extent of over\u2010stocking and under\u2010stocking).

The final phase starts when the part production is terminated and continues until the last service contract or warranty period expires. Placing final orders for service parts is considered to be a popular tactic to satisfy demand during this period and to mitigate the effect of part obsolescence at the end of the service life cycle. Previous research focuses on repairing defective products by replacing the defective parts with properly functioning spare ones. However, for consumer electronic products there typically is considerable price erosion while repair costs stay steady over time. As a consequence, there might be a point in time at which the unit price of the product drops below the repair costs. If so, it is more cost effective to adopt an alternative policy to meet service demands toward the end of the final phase, such as offering customers a new product of the similar type or a discount on a next generation product. This study examines the cost trade\u2010offs of implementing alternative policies for the repair policy and develops an exact expression for the expected total cost function. Using this expression, the optimal final order quantity and switching time from repair to an alternative policy can be determined simultaneously. Numerical analysis of a real world case sheds light on the cost benefits of these policies and also yields insights into the quantitative importance of the various cost parameters.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01340.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost analysis without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

The revenue manager uses a buy\u2010up model to select booking limits and updates estimates of the model parameters as data are accumulated. The buy\u2010up model we consider is based upon a simple model of customer choice, wherein each low\u2010fare customer who is not able to purchase a low\u2010fare ticket will, with a fixed probability, \u201cbuy up\u201d to the high fare, independent of everything else. We analyze the evolution of the parameter estimates (e.g., the buy\u2010up probability) and chosen booking limits in situations where the buy\u2010up model is misspecified, that is, in situations where there is no setting of its parameters for which its objective function gives an accurate representation of expected revenue as a function of the booking limit. The analysis is motivated by the common situation in which a revenue manager does not know precisely how customers behave but nevertheless uses a parametric model to make decisions. Under some assumptions, we prove that the booking limits and parameter estimates converge and we compare the actual expected revenue at the limiting values with that associated with the booking limits that would be chosen if the revenue manager knew the actual behavior of customers. The analysis shows that the buy\u2010up model often works reasonably well even when it is misspecified, and also reveals the importance of understanding how parameter estimates of misspecified models vary as functions of decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01352.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of a revenue management model without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

When only one credit type (either bank or trade credit) is viable, we show that trade credit financing generally charges a higher wholesale price and thus becomes less attractive than bank credit financing for the retailer. When both bank and trade credits are viable, the unique equilibrium is trade credit financing if production cost is relatively low but is bank credit financing otherwise. We also study the case where both the retailer and the manufacturer are capital constrained and demonstrate that, to improve the overall supply chain efficiency, the bank should finance the manufacturer if production cost is low but finance the retailer otherwise.

The competing viewpoints and the asymmetric nature of market returns associated with these goals in R&D projects can heighten stress levels among project team members and reduce their psychological safety.

This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that examines the moderating role of R&D team contextual factors, namely, relative exploration and project\u2010organization metric alignment on the relationship between a key task design variable, namely, team autonomy, and psychological safety. Relative exploration captures the extent to which exploration goals are emphasized over exploitation goals in an R&D project, while project\u2010organization metric alignment measures the extent to which project metrics are aligned with broader organizational metrics. Furthermore, we examine the performance consequences of psychological safety in R&D projects. The empirical analysis is conducted using primary data collected from multiple informants across 110 R&D projects in 34 high technology business units. Our results indicate that relative exploration and project\u2010organization metric alignment have contrasting moderating effects.

We consider a setting in which a marketplace firm operates an online marketplace through which retailers can sell their products directly to consumers. We consider a single retailer, who currently sells its product only through its own website, but who may choose to contract with Amazon to sell its product through the marketplace system. Selling the product through the marketplace expands the available market for the retailer, but comes at some expense, e.g., a fixed participation fee or a revenue sharing requirement.

Assigning and scheduling vehicles to service a pre\u2010determined set of clients is a common distribution problem. Accounting for time\u2010dependent travel times between customers, we present a model that considers travel time, fuel, and CO2 emissions costs. Specifically, we propose a framework for modeling CO2 emissions in a time\u2010dependent vehicle routing context. The model is solved via a tabu search procedure. As the amount of CO2 emissions is correlated with vehicle speed, our model considers limiting vehicle speed as part of the optimization. The emissions per kilometer as a function of speed are minimized at a unique speed. However, we show that in a time\u2010dependent environment this speed is sub\u2010optimal in terms of total emissions. This occurs if vehicles are able to avoid running into congestion periods where they incur high emissions. Clearly, considering this trade\u2010off in the vehicle routing problem has great practical potential. In the same line, we construct bounds on the total amount of emissions to be saved by making use of the standard VRP solutions. As fuel consumption is correlated with CO2 emissions, we show that reducing emissions leads to reducing costs. For a number of experimental settings, we show that limiting vehicle speeds is desired from a total cost perspective.

Using microdata from the brokerage and automotive industries, we find a strong positive relation between customer relationship, ownership of a company, and size of the ownership stake. Investors are also more likely to purchase and less likely to sell shares of companies they frequent as customers. These effects are stronger for individuals with longer customer relationships. A merger-based natural experiment supports a causal interpretation of our results. We also find evidence of causality in the other direction: inheritances and gifts have an effect on individuals' patronage decisions.

We show that the credit market facilitates optimal risk sharing by allowing less risk-averse investors to take on levered positions and consume more risk. The equilibrium amount behaves procyclically when aggregate consumption is low but countercyclically when it is high. The varying size of the credit market modifies the amount of risk sharing, which in turn influences asset prices such as expected stock returns, stock return volatility, and the term structure of interest rates.

In the context of a rational learning model, which we show better matches the empirical relations between future fund-raising and current performance than behavioral alternatives, we estimate that indirect pay for performance from future fund-raising is of the same order of magnitude as direct pay for performance from carried interest. Consistent with the learning framework, indirect pay for performance is stronger when managerial abilities are more scalable and weaker when current performance is less informative about ability. Specifically, it is stronger for buyout funds than for venture capital funds, and declines in the sequence of a partnership's funds. Total pay for performance in private equity is both considerably larger and much more heterogeneous than implied by the carried interest alone. Our framework can be adapted to estimate indirect pay for performance in other asset management settings.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/11/3259/1565124","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of private equity performance and fund-raising without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Moreover, it does not appear to be primarily driven by improvements in governance, disclosure, and access to capital associated with a U.S. cross-listing. Instead, we argue that a cross-listing enhances managers' reliance on stock prices because it makes stock prices more informative to them. Consistent with this explanation, U.S. cross-listings that are more likely to strengthen the informativeness of stock prices for managers feature a higher investment-to-price sensitivity.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/11/3305/1566672","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance related to cross-listing and investment sensitivity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If so, how do they affect the manner in which the capital is raised? Using a large sample of publicly traded debt issues, seasoned equity offers, bank loans, and private placements of equity and debt, we find that a borrower's credit quality significantly affects its ability to raise capital during macroeconomic downturns. For noninvestment-grade borrowers, capital raising tends to be procyclical, while for investment-grade borrowers, it is countercyclical. Poor market conditions also affect the structure of securities offered, shifting them toward shorter maturities and more security. Overall, our results suggest that macroeconomic conditions influence the securities that firms issue to raise capital, the way in which these securities are structured, and indeed firms' ability to raise capital at all.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/2/341/1586132","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of capital raising in relation to macroeconomic conditions without any mention of socially progressive themes, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Compensation changes depend on changes in the evolution of a latent state variable outside the manager's control. Board passivity is positively correlated with both the value of management compensation and the firm's good fortune. Managerial opportunism tends to follow sudden reversals of good fortune.

Jointly optimal capital and priority structures can virtually eliminate investment distortions because debt priority serves as a dynamically optimal contract. Examining the relative efficiency of priority rules observed in practice, we develop several predictions about how firms adjust their priority structure in response to changes in leverage, credit conditions, and firm fundamentals. Notably, financially unconstrained firms with few growth opportunities prefer senior debt, while financially constrained firms, with or without growth opportunities, prefer junior debt. Moreover, lower-rated firms are predicted to spread priority across debt classes. Finally, our analysis has a number of important implications for empirical capital structure research, including the relations between market leverage, book leverage, and credit spreads and Tobin's Q, the influence of firm fundamentals on the agency cost of debt, and the conservative debt policy puzzle.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/3/747/1616886","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital structure and investment decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, making it purely profit-focused."],["2012","25","3","Ronald W.

We find that an increase in mandatory pension contributions increases the cost of capital, but only for firms facing greater external financing constraints. Our results suggest that firms' cost of capital is an intervening variable that can explain Rauh's finding that mandatory pension contributions (i.e., internal financing constraints) result in foregone investment.

Even without risk-shifting behavior, mean reversion of these sorted risk levels results in the detection of tournament behavior.

We find that the propensity to increase risk following poor performance is significantly weaker when incentive pay is tied to the fund's high-water mark and when funds face little immediate risk of liquidation. Risk shifting is also less prevalent when a manager has a significant amount of personal capital invested in the fund. Overall, high-water mark provisions, managerial stake, and low risk of fund closure appear to make a hedge fund manager more conservative with regard to risk shifting.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/3/937/1615380","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of hedge fund management and risk behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It does require trades classified as buys or sells, and we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that we argue is more useful in high-frequency markets than standard classification procedures.

We show that violations are followed immediately by a decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. The changes in the investment and financing behavior of violating firms coincide with amended credit agreements that contain stronger restrictions on firm decision-making; changes in the management of violating firms suggest that creditors also exert informal influence on corporate governance.

These differences can help one determine whether the fruits of a positive macro-level shock have been expropriated by insiders. Using the example of Indian firms, we show that an influential finding is reversed when these differences are considered.

Instead, the evolution of the firm's leverage ratio depends primarily on whether or not the firm produces a financial surplus. In fact, firms that generate subsequent deficits tend to cover these deficits predominantly with more debt even though they exhibit leverage ratios that are well above estimated target levels.

Using comprehensive data on both prime and subprime securitized and bank-held loans, we provide evidence that securitization affected lenders' screening decisions in the subprime market for low-documentation loans through two channels: the securitization rate and the time it takes to securitize a loan. The change in decision-making by subprime lenders occurs on dimensions that are unreported to investors. Examining the time-series evolution of the securitization market further reinforces these findings. We exploit heterogeneity across subprime and prime markets to illustrate that the potential for moral hazard may be reduced with greater collection of hard information and increased monitoring of lenders. Our results suggest that the policy debate regarding securitization and lenders' underwriting standards should separately evaluate the agency and non-agency markets, with special attention toward the extent of soft information in assets being securitized.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/7/2071/1599832","articles","RFS","Finance","2","['moral hazard', 'screening', 'subprime']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of mortgage securitization and lender behavior without addressing social justice or ethical implications.

At the same time, difficulties in inference regarding both the likelihood and severity of disasters, as well as agency problems, can lead to significant disagreements among investors about disaster risk. We show that such disagreements generate strong risk-sharing motives, such that just a small number of optimists in the economy will significantly reduce the disaster risk premium. Our model highlights the \u201clatent\u201d nature of disaster risk. The disaster risk premium will likely be low and smooth during normal times but increases dramatically when the risk-sharing capacity of the optimists is reduced, e.g., following a disaster. The model also helps reconcile the difference in the amount of disaster risk implied by financial markets and international macroeconomic data, and provides caution to the approach of extracting disaster probabilities from asset prices, which will disproportionately reflect the beliefs of a small group of optimists. Finally, our model predicts an inverse U-shaped relation between the equity premium and the size of the disaster insurance market.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/25/7/2189/1601202","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk-sharing and asset pricing without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Corporate investors can provide complementary assets that enhance the commercialization of new venture technologies. However, tight links with a particular corporate investor has drawbacks and may constrain new ventures from accessing complementary assets from diverse sources in an open market. Taking this trade-off into account, we explore conditions under which CVC funding is beneficial to new ventures. Using a sample of computer, semiconductor, and wireless ventures, we find that CVC funding is particularly beneficial for new ventures when they require specialized complementary assets or operate in uncertain environments.

We theorize that at the beginning of their tenures, founder CEOs can pursue market expansion more aggressively than agent CEOs, because they take office with the combination of motivation, power, and requisite knowledge that agent CEOs build over time. Subsequently, however, founder CEOs have less access to the administrative infrastructure necessary to sustain a growing firm, making them less able than agent CEOs to continue market expansion mid-tenure and more severely constrained by market complexity.

Technological similarity only modestly increases learning in the initial stages of a relationship, but moderate levels substantially increase knowledge flows later in the alliance. High technological diversity is related to higher initial learning rates, but the effects diminish over time. Somewhat surprisingly, research and development intensity is negatively related to initial learning rates but has a considerable positive effect later in the relationship.

On one hand, ownership change can make a subsidiary more receptive to innovation by reducing some inertial forces and introducing new resources to overcome others. Alternatively, the costs and demands of an acquisition can draw decision makers' attention away from important innovations in the technological environment. This event history study disentangles these countervailing influences by examining the influences of radio station ownership change on stations' adoptions of HD Radio\u00ae technology. The study finds that a change in ownership control does have a positive direct influence on the likelihood of technology adoption, but that it also curtails tendency for subsidiaries to subsequently mimic others' technology adoptions.

However, there is substantial evidence that decision makers often fail to identify and apply knowledge about one situation to a similarly structured situation. Two experimental studies investigated the mechanisms impacting knowledge transfer from one managerial situation (the source) to an analogous situation. The results show that exposure to variation in the source situation improves transfer performance. Variation decreases performance in the short term but improves learning and increases analogical transfer.

Our results support this hypothesis. We find that firms with low CSP have higher CFP than firms with moderate CSP, but firms with high CSP have the highest CFP.

We propose that a fit among all three factors is crucial to motivate desirable managerial behaviors. Using a specially designed management simulation, our study demonstrates that the effectiveness of incentive compensation to motivate managerial behaviors depends on executives' core self-evaluation and firm performance. Our results show that, relative to fixed salary compensation, executives with higher core self-evaluation respond to incentive compensation with greater perseverance, competitive strategy focus, ethical behavior, and strategic risk taking during organizational decline. However, these interaction effects are not present during organizational growth. Our theory and empirical evidence provide significant insights into the complex relationships among compensation schemes, executives' characteristics, firm performance, and managerial behaviors.

We consider how capability heterogeneity, resource customization cost, and ease of expansion interact to drive short-run and sustainable profits. Our results illustrate that sustainable profits may represent a small part of the total wealth created over time by a firm or industry, and that changes in factors shaping a sector's evolutionary trajectory may be more important than changes in factors that determine profits' ultimate sustainability.

We examine the supply side (firms' illicit payments) of bribery in a global setting, using the United Nations' (UN) Oil-for-Food Program, part of UN sanctions on Iraq. Some companies helped Iraq circumvent UN sanctions through bribe payments in the form of illicit surcharges. Our transaction-level analysis of factors affecting bribe payments draws on the economic theory of crime, agency theory, and home country institutions. Results suggest that firms pay larger bribes when there are stronger financial and managerial incentives, but pay less when their home countries have implemented the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.

We integrate these two perspectives by examining how congruence of the partners' cultures and organizational routines facilitates the emergence of relational mechanisms in non-equity alliances. Our analysis of 420 non-equity alliances in the information technology industry demonstrates how differences in partners' internal task routines undermine relational mechanisms that in turn impact alliance performance. Partners who acknowledge their latent differences can overcome some of these negative consequences. We advance alliance research by studying the performance implications of alliance partners' organizational differences and by demonstrating how these effects are mediated by relational mechanisms.

Such capabilities are likely to be firm specific and cannot be transferred perfectly to competitors' product offerings. Customers who face switching costs are likely to remain with the same firm and consume complementary products that meet their needs. Thus, firms can achieve competitive advantage by exploiting customers' switching costs. In this paper, we hypothesize that the extent to which firms can benefit from customers' switching costs is contingent upon the firms' internal cross-selling capabilities. We use online banking data to test our hypotheses and find that customers' switching costs contribute to banks' profitability only in the presence of high levels of internal cross-selling capabilities.

This research explores managerial incentives as a source of firm heterogeneity in growth option value. We argue that when the payoff structure of managerial incentives corresponds to that of growth options, managers will be motivated to pursue actions that increase firms' growth option value, particularly when greater growth opportunities are available in an industry. Results indicate that stock option holdings and managerial stock ownership have a positive effect on growth option value, while short-term pay has a negative effect. We also find support for a positive interaction effect between equity-based managerial incentives and industry growth opportunities on growth option value. These findings highlight the critical role of managerial incentives in affecting firms' realization of growth option value.

The role of absorptive capacity and ambidexterity","Building a complex portfolio of products can be beneficial for young firms due to increased sales growth and competitiveness. Yet, the benefits from product portfolio complexity (PPC) are often outweighed by rising costs, leading to an inverted U-shaped relationship between PPC and performance. Recent research has called for an increased understanding of how firms are able to better manage higher levels of PPC. We suggest that absorptive capacity and ambidexterity are vital to enhancing the benefits and mitigating the costs of increasing PPC. Using a sample of 215 young high technology firms, we find support for positive moderating effects of absorptive capacity and ambidexterity on the inverted U-shaped relationship between PPC and firm performance.

Differing from previous work that examines the quality of individual locations for investment, the study evaluates the net present value, the growth option value, and the operational flexibility value of the existing production network to predict the establishment of a new site. The results on a sample of 352 German manufacturing firms suggest that the direction, uncertainty, and diversity of labor cost movements in the extant locations influence the propensity to set up a new production subsidiary. Analyzing the international production network after the expansion shows that the new location increases the value of the network regarding these dimensions.

We address this theoretical tension by studying how firms respond to customer requests for incremental product innovations, and how these responses change when the requested innovation is complex. Using large sample empirical analyses combined with detailed qualitative data drawn from interviews, we find considerable variance in the relationship between customer demands, complexity, and investments in incremental innovations.

Our study thus contributes to a more complete conceptual understanding of the performance consequences of pro-market reforms in emerging economies.

Since efficiency -related problems differ in complexity and structure from those associated with adaptability, their optimal governance differs. While the former benefits from outsourcing, the latter is better off managed within organizational boundaries. In addition, a firm's ability to engage in complex problem solving buffers the efficiency-adaptability trade-off that occurs with increasing levels of outsourcing. In this study, we find support for our theses. Although outsourcing yields efficiency gains up to a certain point, it hurts adaptability. However, a firm's absorptive capacity mitigates this trade-off. Our data on outsourcing for Internet banking is both archival and based on two surveys conducted with 100 U.S. banks.

Results from empirical tests in the U.S. mutual fund industry offer two primary findings. First, firms increase proficiency at adapting their processes to address new opportunities as they accumulate experience in entering new niches, but face initial hurdles broadening their experience base. Second, concurrent learning is capacity constrained, as product quality increases in the number of products introduced simultaneously in one niche, but quality decreases as the firm's concurrent portfolio of new products broadens. Jointly, these findings highlight that dynamic capabilities are built through prior adaptation experience and that management of a product development portfolio is an important managerial capability.

Results from a cross-industry sample of U.S. manufacturing firms show successful innovation by a firm is followed by both expansion into new areas through complementary resource seeking acquisitions and divestment out of existing noncore businesses. This relationship is found to be moderated by the level of investible resources available to the firm, and supports the notion of scarce resources as a constraint on firm scope. In addition, firms are found to change their corporate scope in response to rival innovation.

More specifically, we examine diversification in the context of venture capital firms. Drawing on the knowledge and organizational learning literature, we hypothesize that firms benefit from either low levels of diversification because of efficiencies in processing knowledge or high levels of diversification because of access to broad information that facilitates solving complex problems and the ability to direct a portfolio company down different trajectories. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find a U-shaped relationship. Firms benefit from either low or high levels of diversification; moderate levels yield the poorest results. When uncertainty is highest (i.e., early stage investing, no coinvestors), the effects are most pronounced.

In turn, little is known about how founders can break these experience-based constraints, if they exist. In an empirical analysis of 120 prospective entrants in air transportation from 1995\u20132005 we find that a founder's past experience strongly constrains choices, and the effect depends on the form of experience and type of strategy choice.

Although the direct relationship between rational justification and initiative performance is significant, there is no evidence of the moderating effect for this form of influence.

We use the context of post-acquisition coordination, focusing on the extent to which routines created under one organizational architecture (i.e., interorganizational alliances) may transfer to another organizational architecture (i.e., internal divisional structures via acquisition of alliance partners). Using a randomized experimental design, we find that prior resource allocation decisions in the absence of prior communication lowers post-acquisition performance due to the development and transference of pre-acquisition stage routines that may be inappropriate post-acquisition. Post-acquisition performance is aided, however, by the formation of noncompetitive routines in the pre-acquisition stage in the presence of communication.

Pressing challenges include keeping pace with shorter product life cycles, incorporating multiple technologies into the design of new products, cocreating products and services with customers and partners, and leveraging the growth of scientific and technical knowledge in many sectors. In response, we observe experimentation with new organization designs that are fundamentally different from existing forms of organizing. We propose that these new designs are based on an actor-oriented architectural scheme composed of three main elements: (1) actors who have the capabilities and values to self-organize; (2) commons where the actors accumulate and share resources; and (3) protocols, processes, and infrastructures that enable multi-actor collaboration. We demonstrate the usefulness of the actor-oriented scheme by applying it to organizations drawn from four different sectors: global professional services, open source software development, computer equipment, and national defense. We discuss the implications of the actor-oriented architectural scheme for future research on organizational forms as well as for managers who are involved in designing organizations.

Organizational structure, conceptualized as the decision-making structure among a group of individuals, is shown to affect the number of initiatives pursued by organizations and the omission and commission errors (Type I and II errors, respectively) made by organizations. The empirical setting is more than 150,000 stock-picking decisions made by 609 mutual funds. Mutual funds offer an ideal and rare setting to test the theory, since there are detailed records on the projects they face, the decisions they make, and the outcomes of these decisions. The study's independent variable, organizational structure, is coded based on fund management descriptions made by Morningstar, and estimates of the omission and commission errors are computed by a novel technique that uses bootstrapping to create measures that are comparable across funds. The findings suggest that organizational structure has relevant and predictable effects on a wide range of organizations. In particular, the article shows empirically that increasing the consensus threshold required by a committee in charge of selecting projects leads to more omission errors, fewer commission errors, and fewer approved projects. Applications include designing organizations that achieve a given mix of exploration and exploitation, as well as predicting the consequences of centralization and decentralization. This work constitutes the first large-sample empirical test of the model by Sah and Stiglitz (1986).

Holding the external context constant, our evidence shows that individuals do process information differently under the two structural types, which then leads to different comfort levels in dealing with organizational problems.

Using an inductive analysis of GE's governance system from 1951 to 2001, we examine how the integration of corporate and business unit attention occurs within and across the firm's governance channels. Our theory identifies an unexplored aspect of the M-form's architecture: collective vertical interactions between the corporate office and business units through cross-level channels. Overall, we articulate three types of channel integration\u2014cross-level, cross-functional, and channel coupling\u2014and examine their effects on responsiveness to threats and opportunities. We find that despite an elaborate organizational architecture, there were periods when GE's governance system did not allow for coordination of corporate and business unit agendas. Our theory proposes that the temporal coupling of specialized, cross-level channels creates an organizational architecture that is both differentiated and integrated. This architecture integrates levels and issues simultaneously, yet focuses attention sequentially, providing more effective conditions for joint attention and coordination between the corporation office and the business unit and adaptive change at the business unit level.

We review two proposed approaches for achieving simultaneously high levels of exploration and exploitation: organizational ambidexterity and organizational vacillation. To facilitate comparison, we map these approaches onto a common performance landscape, making precise the empirical question of which delivers superior long run performance. We then analyze canonical cases from both literatures, examining patterns of decision making and corresponding performance over time. These cases suggest that vacillation may offer higher long run performance than ambidexterity, while ambidexterity enhances performance on the margin when utilized within larger epochs of vacillation. We conclude that ambidexterity and vacillation are complements with respect to performance, albeit through different mechanisms.

We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops.

Specifically, early adopters of C-TPAT processes in a weak institutional context that reported high levels of investment performed no better than firms who invested nominally in the processes, while late adopters in a strong institutional context that reported high investment levels outperformed those that invested nominally.

This empirical puzzle has been a focal point of debate in the R&D literature. We show that innovators may share proprietary technology with rivals for free\u2014even if it does not directly benefit them\u2014to slow down competition. By disclosing IP, innovators indirectly induce rivals to wait and imitate instead of concurrently investing in innovation, which alleviates competitive pressure. In contrast with the classical strategy view, our paper also shows that imitators may not always benefit from interfirm knowledge spillovers. Specifically, imitators may want to limit the know-how that they can freely appropriate from innovators.

We address this gap with a multilevel analysis that investigates how managerial and functional organizational capabilities affect whether struggling firms exit by acquisition or dissolution. We demonstrate that managerial and functional capabilities have heterogeneous effects on selection processes, with managerial capabilities having particularly strong influence on acquisition exits by struggling firms. The work provides a bridge between adaptation and selection views on organizational change; exit by dissolution represents selection of both firms and capabilities, while exit by acquisition represents firm selection but capability adaptation.

We propose and test a model wherein trust, based on partner reliability, is constrained to the IOR exchange context where it develops and does not generalize to other contexts. Distrust, rooted in value incongruence, more readily generalizes across exchange contexts. Results support these predictions. In addition, our analysis shows that trust and distrust combine such that managers decrease their preferences for highly specific focal-context contracts only when in-context trust is high and distrust is low. We discuss how these findings may provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between trust-based and contract-based IOR governance.

Also, the effect is significantly reduced if the licensee is unfamiliar with the licensed technology.

The results indicate that variation among individuals matter far more in organizational performance than is generally assumed.

Survey data from high technology companies in China demonstrate that the effects of knowledge breadth and depth are contingent on market knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing in opposite ways. In particular, a firm with a broad knowledge base is more likely to achieve radical innovation in the presence of internal knowledge sharing rather than market knowledge acquisition. In contrast, a firm with a deep knowledge base is more capable of developing radical innovation through market knowledge acquisition rather than internal knowledge sharing.

However, while the consequences of the timing of action within a merger wave have been assessed, the causes that drive these timing effects remain unknown. We draw on the competitive dynamics perspective to investigate firm-level factors that influence the large-scale strategic behavior of leading or following within industry merger waves. We develop hypotheses based on the competitive dynamics argument that the awareness-motivation-capability of firms will influence the timing of competitive action. Consistent with this perspective, we show that a firm's strategic orientation, its structure, and its resource base influence the timing of firm entry in merger waves.

CFO management is distinct from earnings management. Unlike the manipulation of accruals, firms cannot manage CFO with biased estimates, but must resort to classification and timing. I identify four firm characteristics associated with incentives to inflate reported CFO: (1) financial distress, (2) a long-term credit rating near the investment/non-investment grade cutoff, (3) the existence of analyst cash flow forecasts, and (4) higher associations between stock returns and CFO. Results indicate that, even after controlling for the level of earnings, firms upward manage reported CFO when the incentives to do so are particularly high. Specifically, firms manage CFO by shifting items between th estatement of cash flows categories both within and outside the boundaries of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and by timing certain transactions such as delaying payments to suppliers or accelerating collections from customers.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/1/3309/Incentives-to-Inflate-Reported-Cash-from","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and manipulation without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We argue that this approach lacks representational faithfulness and creates an informational problem for users. Using an experiment, we show that the proposed treatment of renewal options has a negative effect on lenders' willingness to lend to a firm with renewal options. However, we also show that disaggregating the capitalized optional renewal periods from the fixed-term lease obligation mitigates some of the negative effects of the proposed approach, particularly when disaggregation occurs on the face of the financial statements. These results should be of interest to standard-setters as they deliberate changes to lease accounting and when considering the trade-offs that can arise with expansive unit of account choices.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/173/3278/Accounting-for-Lease-Renewal-Options-The","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of lease accounting without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Moreover, disclosure activity substantially improves the value of cash assets in excess of requirements for operations and investment. These findings suggest that detailed reporting facilitates the scrutiny and discipline of capital markets, thus preventing the diversion of cash reserves. In further support of the disciplinary power of greater disclosure, we find that value-destroying projects, through internal capital investment and external acquisitions, are concentrated in firms adopting opaque disclosure policies.

We predict that compensation committees are aware of these incentives and adjust the relative weights placed on earnings components in the cash compensation function to mitigate the problem. Consistent with our prediction, we find that in CEOs' terminal years, positive changes in discretionary accruals receive significantly less weight than other income components in determining cash compensation. This provides new evidence that not all gains flow through to compensation. We also find that in non-terminal years, managers' compensation is partially shielded from the negative effects of selling, general, and administrative expenditures (SG&A), but this effect reverses in the terminal period, consistent with the compensation committee discouraging investment in legacy assets by outgoing CEOs. Overall, our findings suggest that compensation committees treat components of earnings differently when setting pay in the terminal period.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/231/3337/Compensation-Committees-Treatment-of-Earnings","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['compensation', 'earnings', 'manipulate']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of compensation committees and earnings manipulation without addressing broader social issues or ethical critiques.

We decompose this strength-assessment judgment into its components\u2014relevance assessment and source and relevance combination\u2014and consider the effects of experience. Participants in our experiment assess the strength and relevance of tax authorities in relation to a client scenario. Contrary to prior research, we find that more-experienced participants exhibit greater use of analogical reasoning when evaluating tax-authority relevance than do less-experienced participants. We find a similar experience effect in the use of configural information processing to combine authority source and relevance, a judgment not previously considered in tax. The effects of experience are particularly important in the current environment as the tax function is a leading cause of material weaknesses and restatements under Sarbanes-Oxley and tax executives cite increasing difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified professionals.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/291/3390/Evaluating-the-Strength-of-Evidence-How-Experience","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of evidence evaluation in accounting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our evidence indicates that these provisions did not affect the commercial banking industry in the ways commonly alleged by critics. First, we show that fair value accounting losses had minimal effect on regulatory capital. Then, we examine sales of securities during the crisis, finding mixed evidence that banks sold securities in response to capital-depleting charges. However, the sales that potentially resulted from the charges appear to be economically insignificant, as there was no industry- or firm-level increase in sales of securities during the crisis.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/59/3286/A-Convenient-Scapegoat-Fair-Value-Accounting-by","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['fair value', 'financial crisis', 'regulatory capital']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices during the financial crisis, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We then opine that there are multiple potential sources of large positive book-tax differences. We predict and find that firms with large positive book-tax differences likely arising from upward earnings management (tax avoidance) exhibit lower (higher) earnings and accruals persistence than do other firms with large positive book-tax differences. Finally, we find significant variation in current-period earnings and accruals response coefficients and insignificant hedge returns in period t+1, consistent with investors being able to look through to the source of large positive book-tax differences (earnings management and tax avoidance), allowing them to correctly price the persistence of accruals for these subsamples.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/1/91/3409/Tax-Avoidance-Large-Positive-Temporary-Book-Tax","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to tax avoidance and earnings persistence without addressing any themes related to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices."],["2012","87","2","Panos N.

In contrast to the conventional view of customer-base concentration as an impediment to supplier firm performance, I document a positive contemporaneous association between CC and accounting rates of return, suggesting that efficiencies accrue to suppliers with concentrated customer bases. Consistent with a cause-and-effect link between customer-base concentration and supplier firm performance, analysis of intertemporal changes demonstrates that CC increases predict efficiency gains in the form of reduced operating expenses per dollar of sales and enhanced asset utilization. Using stock returns tests, I find that investors underreact to the implications of changes in customer-base concentration for future firm fundamentals when setting stock prices.

We illustrate that, when a gray market competitor exists, the optimal transfer price to a foreign subsidiary exceeds marginal cost and is decreasing in the competitiveness of the domestic market. However, a multinational's discretion in setting transfer prices may be limited by mandatory arm's length transfer pricing rules. Provided gray markets exist, we characterize when mandating arm's length transfer pricing lowers domestic social welfare relative to unrestricted transfer pricing.

In our setting, shareholders make a non-contractible project choice after signing a debt contract. At a later date, the project can be abandoned and new information determines whether shareholders or creditors make that decision. The value of debt covenants depends on their ability to deter costly asset substitution while also mitigating inefficient continuation decisions. A covenant based on a conservative fair value measure tends to perform best in this respect. Departing from purely fair-value-based covenants, an even more conservative covenant based on fair values and historical cost outperforms those based solely on fair values. Notably, the \u201chighest and best use\u201d measure advocated by the FASB performs poorly in deterring the choice of inferior projects. Our results provide a setting in which the contracting efficiencies associated with different accounting measures cannot be replicated across measures by altering covenant \u201ctriggers.\u201d","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/2/483/3435/Assessing-the-Impact-of-Alternative-Fair-Value","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting measures and their impact on investment decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine the implications of doing so, and find that when a CEO accepts responsibility by making an internal attribution for a restatement, investors viewing the announcement online via video recommend larger investments in the firm than do investors viewing the announcement online via text. In contrast, when the CEO denies responsibility by making an external attribution for the restatement, investors viewing the announcement online via video recommend smaller investments in the firm than do investors viewing the announcement online via text. Our results also reveal that investor trust mediates the effect of disclosure venue and attribution on investment recommendations.

When the client's reporting is more aggressive and violates the precise standard, juries return fewer verdicts against auditors under the imprecise standard, especially when the reporting complies with the industry norm. When the client's reporting is less aggressive and complies with the precise standard, juries return more verdicts against auditors under the imprecise standard, but only when the client's reporting is more aggressive than the industry norm.

Using empirical examples motivated by prior research, we illustrate that selection models are fragile and can yield quite literally any possible outcome in response to fairly minor changes in model specification.

The first circumstance is when a firm's systematic risk is very high. The second circumstance is when the market risk premium is very high. The third circumstance is when the risk-free rate of return is very low. The circumstances arise because, in addition to reducing investors' expected after-tax cash proceeds, capital gains taxes reduce the risk that investors associate with the expected after-tax cash proceeds.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/3/1067/3386/Capital-Gains-Taxes-and-Expected-Rates-of-Return","other articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital gains taxes and their relation to expected rates of return without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We define investment-related pressure as the increased pressure managers feel to retain their job following an M&A poorly received by the market. We hypothesize that managers attempt to assuage pressure by delivering strong performance post-merger, creating incentives for misreporting. Our findings indicate that acquirers with more negative M&A announcement returns are more likely to misstate financial statements in the post-investment period and the issuance of misstated financials mitigates this pressure, at least in the near term. Our study contributes to the literature on the relation between corporate investing and financial reporting by showing how investment-related pressure leads to misreporting, even in a setting where the costs (e.g., greater probability of detection) are high. Our study also has implications for the large body of research that evaluates various consequences of M&As using post-merger performance.

We test for the effects of IR programs by examining small-cap companies that hired IR firms in a differences-in-differences research design with controls for changes in disclosure and determinants of the decision to initiate IR. Relative to a matched sample of control firms, we find that companies initiating IR programs exhibit greater increases in institutional investor ownership and a shift toward investors that normally would not follow the companies.

We predict that a strict consultation requirement will lead to greater propensity to consult, particularly under certain client- and engagement-related conditions. Results from two experiments with 163 Dutch audit managers and partners demonstrate that consultation propensity is higher under a strict consultation requirement, but only when underlying fraud risk is high. The strictness effect is also greater under tight versus relaxed time pressure. Further, a strict standard increases auditors' perceived probability that a fraud indicator exists. Overall, we demonstrate that the formulation of a standard can have the desired effect on the judgments of auditors while also creating unexpected incentives that may influence auditor judgments.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/3/925/3366/The-Effect-of-the-Strictness-of-Consultation","other articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit practices and the effects of consultation requirements on fraud detection, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that the external audit firm's overall expertise is generally associated with greater tax avoidance, which suggests that overall experts are able to combine their audit and tax expertise to develop tax strategies that benefit clients from both a tax and financial statement perspective.

Using comparative analysis on a broad sample of 11,719 firm-quarter observations for 1,389 firms during the period 1998 through 2005, we find evidence that FIN 46 significantly increased the cost of equity capital for firms with affected variable interest entities (VIEs), an increase of approximately 50 basis points relative to firms reporting no material effect from the standard. Further, firms consolidating these formerly off-balance sheet structures experienced the largest increase. Taken together, these results suggest that FIN 46 reduced the opportunity for firms to use off-balance sheet structures to artificially reduce their cost of capital, a matter of regulatory concern.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1105/3446/An-Examination-of-the-Cost-of-Capital-Implications","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and their impact on the cost of capital without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Ideally, managers see measures for what they are\u2014imperfect proxies for intangible strategic constructs. However, managers may fail to fully appreciate the fact that measures are merely representations of the strategic constructs, and act as though the measures are the construct of interest\u2014a phenomenon we label surrogation. In this paper, we investigate whether and how the use of strategically linked performance measures for compensation purposes affects managers' propensity to exhibit surrogation. In accordance with the attribute substitution framework (Kahneman and Frederick 2002), we predict incentive compensation exacerbates surrogation, and that this effect is more prevalent when managers are compensated on a single measure of a strategic construct than when managers are compensated on multiple measures of a strategic construct. Via two experiments, we find support for these hypotheses. Our paper contributes to the literature on strategic performance measurement systems by highlighting the tendency of managers to use measures as surrogates for strategy. More generally, we identify a by-product of contracting on imperfect performance measures not previously considered in extant literature, and establish when consideration of costs of this by-product are likely to be critical.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1135/3495/Lost-in-Translation-The-Effects-of-Incentive","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of performance measurement and managerial decision-making without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

That is, negative special items serve as an \u201cinter-period transfer\u201d device. We extend their analysis and find that earnings increase in post-special item quarters beyond the four quarters considered in Burgstahler et al. (2002). In particular, we find that future earnings increase over the subsequent 16 quarters by more than 130 percent of the reported negative special item. The earnings increases are greater for restructuring charges than for asset write-downs or goodwill impairment charges. Such patterns suggest that negative special items also signal real future performance improvements (i.e., performance improvement hypothesis) in addition to inter-period expense transfer (i.e., inter-period transfer hypothesis). Moreover, the real improvement effect appears to be driven by restructuring charges, the most prevalent type of special item.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1165/3385/Negative-Special-Items-and-Future-Earnings-Expense","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices related to earnings and special items without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We posit that relative to managers of firms reporting healthy profits, managers meeting or beating the zero earnings benchmark will increase labor costs to a smaller extent when activity increases and decrease labor costs to a larger extent when activity decreases. This should take the form of more symmetric labor cost behavior for firms that report a small profit. Our findings are consistent with this prediction. Using detailed employee data, we show that managers of firms reporting a small profit focus on firing employees who are relatively low cost to fire. To protect their reputation in the labor market, managers of other firms, particularly those reporting healthy profits, limit the numbers of dismissals and react to activity changes by changing the number of hours that employees work.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1219/3484/Do-Managerial-Incentives-Drive-Cost-Behavior","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial incentives and labor cost behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In our model, a manager identifies with an organization and loses utility to the extent that his actions conflict with effort-standards issued by the principal. Contrary to prior arguments in the literature, we find conditions under which a manager who identifies strongly with the organization receives stronger incentives and faces more performance evaluation reports than a manager who does not identify with the organization. Our theory predicts that managers who experience events that boost their identification with the firm can decrease their effort in short-term value creation. We also find that firms are more likely to employ less precise but more congruent performance measures, such as stock prices, when contracting with managers who identify little with the organization. In contrast, they use more precise but less congruent measures, such as accounting earnings, when contracting with managers who identify strongly with the firm.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1309/3396/Identity-Incentives-and-the-Value-of-Information","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['identity', 'performance measurement', 'incentives']","The article discusses the concept of identity in relation to performance measurement and incentives, which touches on themes of organizational behavior and individual identity.

Despite their importance, very little research has addressed how financial statement users apply these constructs. Via experiments set within the fair value context, we show that users do not view them as independent constructs. Instead, variations in properties that are associated with the reliability of a measurement influence users' assessments of the relevance of fair value. The relationship between assessed relevance and assessed reliability is unidirectional, in that factors underlying reliability influence judgments of relevance, but factors underlying relevance do not influence judgments of reliability. Our findings are important because inappropriate assessments of relevance can influence firm valuation. The results are particularly meaningful in the context of fair value because such measurements can vary widely in reliability.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1335/3408/Do-Financial-Statement-Users-Judge-Relevance-Based","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and the relationship between relevance and reliability without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

This influence of sentiment is especially pronounced for the earnings news of small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, and stocks with extremely high and low market-to-book ratios.

These lower (higher) cash flow shocks offset the higher (lower) expected returns of poor (good) accrual quality firms. After excluding cash flow shocks, future realized returns are negatively associated with accrual quality. The premiums pertaining to accrual quality are both statistically and economically significant in standard asset-pricing tests when cash flow shocks are excluded by firm-specific return decomposition. Overall, this paper provides evidence on the existence of a priced accrual quality risk factor, and underscores the importance of controlling for cash flow shocks in asset-pricing tests that use realized returns.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/4/1415/3434/Accrual-Quality-Realized-Returns-and-Expected","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accrual quality and financial returns without addressing any social or ethical themes.

Moreover, findings suggest that the increase in tax avoidance is greater when activists have a successful track record of implementing tax changes and possess tax interest or knowledge as indicated by their Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 13D filings.

Our model extends prior literature by determining quantities and prices in equilibrium, rather than specifying them exogenously. We find that LIFO repeal could increase the future after-tax cash flows of firms that had used LIFO, because the higher tax costs associated with FIFO result in lower equilibrium quantities and higher equilibrium output prices, which increase pretax cash flows. We illustrate our model by examining inventory methods used by firms in the oil industry.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/5/1589/3367/Unintended-Consequences-of-LIFO-Repeal-The-Case-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of accounting practices related to tax implications without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

I find that the relative intensity of small traders' trading response (and, to a lesser extent, that of medium traders) to earnings surprises generally increases as a series progresses. Small traders respond more negatively to the second (third) negative surprise in a series than to the first (second), and more positively for the first three surprises in a positive series.

Our results are robust to various controls for endogeneity concerns.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/6/1861/3400/Audit-Quality-and-the-Trade-Off-between-Accretive","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit quality and earnings management without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

While individual (intragroup) tournament pay increases individual efforts, we find that it does not enhance the creativity of group solutions relative to individual piece-rate pay. Our results advance the burgeoning management accounting literature on creativity-contingent incentives by demonstrating that reward systems are more likely to promote group creativity through collaborative efforts rather than independent individual efforts.

Prior research suggests that when governed by complete incentive contracts, agents exert greater effort under penalty contracts relative to bonus contracts. However, in an incomplete contract setting, in which the incentive contract does not govern all tasks for which the agent is responsible, the agent's trust in the principal is relevant. In this setting, we predict that bonus contracts create a more trusting environment, and this effect spills over to tasks not governed by the incentive contract, such that bonus contracts elicit greater effort on these tasks as compared to penalty contracts. We develop and experimentally validate a theoretical model of the effects of contract frame on trust and effort in this incomplete contract setting. The main intuition behind the model is that the framing of an incentive contract affects the degree to which the contract terms are interpreted by the agent as a signal of mistrust. More specifically, penalty contracts engender greater distrust than do bonus contracts and, therefore, when contracts are incomplete, penalty contracts lead to lower effort on tasks not governed by the contract than do bonus contracts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/6/1913/3481/Sticks-and-Carrots-The-Effect-of-Contract-Frame-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['trust', 'incentive contracts', 'effort']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of contract framing and its impact on agent effort, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We first show that an intuitive reason for analysts to engage in rounding is in circumstances where the penny digit of the forecast is of less economic significance. By rounding, analysts reveal that their forecasts are not intended to be precise to the penny. We also show that analyst incentives impact the likelihood of rounding. Specifically, we predict that analysts will exert less effort forecasting earnings for firms that generate less brokerage or investment banking business since such firms create less value for the analysts' employers. As a consequence of this reduced effort and attention, the analyst will be more uncertain about the penny digit of the forecast and so will round. Our results are consistent with this prediction. One implication of our findings is that a rounded forecast is a simple and easily observable proxy for a more noisy measure of the market's expectation of earnings. Consistent with this implication, we show that rounded forecasts bias down earnings response coefficients at earnings announcements.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/6/1939/3471/Analysts-Motives-for-Rounding-EPS-Forecasts","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings forecasts without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

In this study, we provide large sample evidence on the cross-sectional determinants of forecast dispersion and examine to what extent analysts' strategic behavior biases the observed dispersion from the dispersion of unmanaged forecasts. We propose a method to estimate the dispersion bias for each sample observation. We find that observed dispersion, on average, understates dispersion of unmanaged forecasts by 53.4 percent and this downward bias varies considerably across firms. We further discuss the implications of the significant cross-sectional variation in the bias in observed dispersion for studies that rely on dispersion to estimate constructs such as consensus and information quality as well as those that use dispersion directly in research design.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/6/2123/3504/The-Effect-of-Financial-Analysts-Strategic","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial analysts' behavior and forecast dispersion without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

I find that the reporting benefits of aggregate-employee option grants under SFAS 123 are associated with the change in the mix of CEO option grants and stock grants that occurs after SFAS 123(R), suggesting that reporting benefits of option grants may have influenced some CEO compensation decisions. Additionally, I find that the reduction in CEO pay after SFAS 123(R) is greater when shareholders have more power to act in their own best interest and when there is evidence of pre-expensing CEO compensation rents. The findings suggest that SFAS 123 may have encouraged inefficient, CEO-preferential pay practices and that SFAS 123(R) may have contributed to a reduction in CEO compensation inefficiencies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/87/6/2151/3444/CEO-Pay-Managerial-Power-and-SFAS-123-R","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['CEO compensation', 'shareholders', 'power']","The article primarily focuses on CEO compensation and its implications for shareholders, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.
