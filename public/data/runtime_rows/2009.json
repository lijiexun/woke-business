As a state, institutionalization is embodied in the structure of argument used to justify a practice at a given point in time. As a process, institutionalization is modeled as changes in the structure of arguments used to justify a practice over time. We use rhetoric surrounding the institutionalization of total quality management (TQM) practices within the American business community as a case study to illustrate how conceptualizing institutionalization as changes in argument structure can help show how institutions simultaneously constrain and enable social action.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2009.36461725","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['institutionalization', 'social action', 'rhetorical theory']","The article discusses institutionalization and social action, which hints at a consideration of social dynamics within organizations.

Contracting offers less job security and less employer-provided training than regular employment. We base our predictions of which workers contract on how their preferences and resources match such jobs. Using career history data, we found that the likelihood of contracting increases with skill levels and presence of negative cues, and falls (for men) with family responsibilities. Contracting is more likely among workers whose careers are either just beginning or well advanced; the latter group also remains in contracting longer. These findings have implications for benefits, skills development, and income security policies.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2009.47084649","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['job security', 'income security', 'family responsibilities']","The article discusses themes related to job security and the impact of family responsibilities on contracting decisions, which touch on social equity issues.

Greater numbers of environmental movement organization members increased nascent entrepreneurial activity, and this effect was mediated by favorable state regulatory policy.

We used qualitative data from interviews with U.S. zookeepers to develop hypotheses about the implications of this neoclassical conceptualization of calling for the relationship between individuals and their work. We found that a neoclassical calling is both binding and ennobling. On one hand, zookeepers with a sense of calling strongly identified with and found broader meaning and significance in their work and occupation. On the other hand, they were more likely to see their work as a moral duty, to sacrifice pay, personal time, and comfort for their work, and to hold their zoo to a higher standard. Results of a survey of zookeepers from 157 different zoos in the U.S. and Canada supported the hypotheses from our emergent theory.

We consider the joint effects of geographic propinquity and network position on organizational innovation using negative binomial count models of patenting activity for U.S.-based life science firms in industrial districts and regional clusters across a 12-year time period, 1988\u20131999.

Results show that in the high-velocity, research-intensive field of biotechnology, geographic and network positions have both independent and contingent effects on organizational innovation. The influence of centrality in local, physically co-located partner networks depends on the extent to which firms are also embedded in a global network comprising physically distant partners. Such global centrality, however, alters how proximity to two important classes of organization-other biotechnology firms and public sector research organizations, such as universities, research institutes, and teaching hospitals\u2014influences innovation. Regional agglomeration shapes the character of information and resource flows through networks, while much of what makes industrial clusters region-like involves the structure of their internal networks.

Using data on informal exchanges among investment bankers in the equities division of a large financial services firm operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and the Americas in 2001, we find that network closure in relationships in which the banker acts as an acquirer of information increases his or her performance, whereas closure in relationships in which the banker acts as a provider of information decreases it. We also find that these effects are moderated by the bankers' ability to employ alternative means (such as formal authority) to induce the cooperation of exchange partners in their acquirer role, as well as by the extent to which the bankers can benefit from being free from the control of exchange partners in their provider role. Our findings highlight the two sides of the normative control associated with network closure: control benefits people when they need to induce exchange partners to behave according to their preferences, but it hurts them when it forces them to behave according to the preferences of those partners.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.2.299","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['control', 'performance', 'network closure']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of performance related to network closure in a business context, with no significant emphasis on social justice or ethical themes.

Our aim is to develop a more precise theory of the fundamental relationships among structure, performance, and environment. We find that the structure-performance relationship is unexpectedly asymmetric, in that it is better to err on the side of too much structure, and that different environmental dynamism dimensions (i.e., velocity, complexity, ambiguity, and unpredictability) have unique effects on performance. Increasing unpredictability decreases optimal structure and narrows its range from a wide to a narrow set of effective strategies. We also find that a strategy of simple rules, which combines improvisation with low-to-moderately structured rules to execute a variety of opportunities, is viable in many environments but essential in some. This sharpens the boundary condition between the strategic logics of positioning and opportunity. And juxtaposing the structural challenges of adaptation for entrepreneurial vs. established organizations, we find that entrepreneurial organizations should quickly add structure in all environments, while established organizations are better off seeking predictable environments unless they can devote sufficient attention to managing a dissipative equilibrium of structure (i.e., edge of chaos) in unpredictable environments.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.3.413","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on structural and strategic dynamics in organizations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I propose that brokers prefer to represent high-quality actors and that the value an actor places on representation is inversely related to the actor's perceived quality. But matching of more reputable brokers with higher-quality actors should mitigate these quality constraints. Empirical analyses of 1,028 venture capital funds raised by 745 firms from 2001 to 2006 support the theory. The likelihood that a firm's venture fund is represented by a placement agent first increases and then decreases with firm quality, measured as size, experience, and status. Neither those that value representation most (i.e., funds of low perceived quality) nor those that placement agents would most like to represent (i.e., funds of high perceived quality) are most likely to be represented by a placement agent. Results also show that more reputable placement agents represent funds raised by higher-quality firms, which indicates that a broker's reputation mitigates constraints on the control benefits of brokerage.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.4.575","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of brokerage in venture capital fundraising without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The impact of high-level choices may appear weak, we theorize, because the choices are embedded in coupled search processes. A coupled search process exists in an organization when managers search for high-level choices that shape the search for low-level, operational choices, which in turn determine performance. Using a simulation model, we show that coupled search processes obscure the performance impact of high-level choices through two mechanisms: (1) a survivor effect, arising because firms that persist with poor high-level choices are those that luckily happened on good low-level choices despite their poor high-level choices, and (2) a wanderer effect, arising when firms use good high-level choices to find good low-level choices and achieve strong performance but then wander toward poor high-level choices. We show that these effects are particularly strong in stable environments, and we identify empirical strategies that can tease out the true performance impact of high-level choices.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2009.54.4.602","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational performance and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The literature in this field provides equilibrium analysis for ICAs with nonlinear personalized prices under strong assumptions on bidders' strategies. Linear pricing has performed very well in the lab and in the field. In this paper, we compare three selected linear price ICA formats based on allocative efficiency and revenue distribution using different bidding strategies and bidder valuations. The goal of this research is to benchmark different ICA formats and design and analyze new auction rules for auctions with pseudodual linear prices. The multi-item and discrete nature of linear price iterative combinatorial auctions and the complex price calculation schemes defy much of the traditional game theoretical analysis in this field. Computational methods can be of great help in exploring potential auction designs and analyzing the virtues of various design options. In our simulations, we found that ICA designs with linear prices performed very well for different valuation models even in cases of high synergies among the valuations. There were, however, significant differences in efficiency and in the revenue distributions of the three ICA formats. Heuristic bidding strategies using only a few of the best bundles also led to high levels of efficiency. We have also identified a number of auction rules for ask price calculation and auction termination that have shown to perform very well in the simulations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0151","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auction formats and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, although many participants had the urge to buy impulsively, regardless of website quality, this behavior's likelihood and magnitude was directly influenced by varying the quality of task-relevant and mood-relevant cues. Task-relevant cues include characteristics, such as navigability, that help in the attainment of the online consumer's shopping goal. Conversely, mood-relevant cues refer to the characteristics, such as visual appeal, that affect the degree to which a user enjoys browsing a website but that do not directly support a particular shopping goal.

For example, industry statistics suggest that between 50%\u201375% of security incidents originate from within an organization. Because of the large number of misuse incidents, it has become important to understand how to reduce such behavior. General deterrence theory suggests that certain controls can serve as deterrent mechanisms by increasing the perceived threat of punishment for IS misuse. This paper presents an extended deterrence theory model that combines work from criminology, social psychology, and information systems. The model posits that user awareness of security countermeasures directly influences the perceived certainty and severity of organizational sanctions associated with IS misuse, which leads to reduced IS misuse intention. The model is then tested on 269 computer users from eight different companies. The results suggest that three practices deter IS misuse: user awareness of security policies; security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs; and computer monitoring. The results also suggest that perceived severity of sanctions is more effective in reducing IS misuse than certainty of sanctions. Further, there is evidence that the impact of sanction perceptions vary based on one's level of morality. Implications for the research and practice of IS security are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0160","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['misuse', 'deterrence', 'morality']","The article discusses user awareness and moral perceptions in the context of information systems misuse, indicating some ethical considerations.

However, little thought is usually given to the quality of the source data, its impact on the quality of the derived information, and how this in turn affects decisions. To assess quality, one needs a framework that defines relevant metrics that constitute the quality profile of a relation, and provides mechanisms for their evaluation. We build on a quality framework proposed in prior work, and develop quality profiles for the result of the primitive relational operations Difference and Union. These operations have nuances that make both the classification of the resulting records as well as the estimation of the different classes quite difficult to address, and very different from that for other operations. We first determine how tuples appearing in the results of these operations should be classified as accurate, inaccurate or mismember, and when tuples that should appear do not (called incomplete) in the result. Although estimating the cardinalities of these subsets directly is difficult, we resolve this by decomposing the problem into a sequence of drawing processes, each of which follows a hyper-geometric distribution. Finally, we discuss how decisions would be influenced based on the resulting quality profiles.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0161","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information quality and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

The Impact of Task-Technology Fit and Appropriation on Team Performance in Repeated Tasks","Prior research on technology and team performance concludes that the fit of the technology to tasks influences team performance. It also suggests that the way teams appropriate technology influences performance. This research examines how fit and appropriation (from the Fit Appropriation Model) influence performance over time. Initially, the results show that fit better predicted performance; teams using poor-fitting technology performed worse than teams with better fitting technology. However, over a short time period (two days in this study), this initial fit no longer predicted performance; performance of teams using better fitting technology remained constant while teams using poor-fitting technology innovated and adapted, improving performance. There are two key findings from this study. First, fit can predict team performance soon after technology adoption, but initial assessments of fit are temporary as teams innovate and adapt; thus, our current theoretical models of fitting technology to a task likely will not be useful beyond the first use. Second, teams should understand how to better adapt existing technology and work structures. Because our current theories of task-technology fit failed to predict performance beyond the first use of technology, we believe that this calls for a reconsideration of what fit means for teams using technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0167","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['fit', 'performance', 'technology']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of task-technology fit and team performance without addressing social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We develop an augmented form of the Cobb-Douglas production function to separate and measure different productivity-enhancing effects of IT. Using industry-level data from the manufacturing sector, we find evidence that both direct and indirect effects of IT are significant. Partitioning industries into IT-intensive and non-IT-intensive, we find that the indirect effects of IT predominate in the IT-intensive sector. In contrast, the direct effects of IT predominate in the non-IT intensive sector. These results indicate structural differences in the role of IT in production between industries that are IT-intensive and those that are not.

The model differs from previous studies by proposing a moderating effect of competition on the resource-performance relationships. Using data of 743 manufacturing firms, our analysis indicates significant contribution of IT to supply chains, which is generated through development of the digitally enabled integration capability and manifested at the process level along the supply chain. The technological resource alone, however, does not hold the answer to IT value creation. In fact, managerial skills, which enable adaptations on supply chain processes and corporate strategy to accommodate the use of IT, are shown to play the strongest role in IT value creation. Furthermore, backend integration and managerial skills are found to be more valuable in more competitive environments. While commodity-like resources have diminishing value under competition, integrational and managerial resources become even stronger.

We further posit that shared language, shared domain knowledge manifest in the CIO's business knowledge and the TMT's strategic IS knowledge, systems of knowing (structural and social), and CIO-TMT experiential similarity are important determinants of this shared understanding. Data were collected from 243 matched CIO-TMT pairs. Results largely support the proposed nomological network.

The common practice of using a layered security architecture that has multiple technologies amplifies the need for proper configuration because the configuration decision about one security technology has ramifications for the configuration decisions about others. Furthermore, security technologies rely on each other for their operations, thereby affecting each other's contribution. In this paper we study configuration of and interaction between a firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS). We show that deploying a technology, whether it is the firewall or the IDS, could hurt the firm if the configuration is not optimized for the firm's environment. A more serious consequence of deploying the two technologies with suboptimal configurations is that even if the firm could benefit when each is deployed alone, the firm could be hurt by deploying both. Configuring the IDS and the firewall optimally eliminates the conflict between them, ensuring that if the firm benefits from deploying each of these technologies when deployed alone, it will always benefit from deploying both. When optimally configured, we find that these technologies complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, we find that while the optimal configuration of an IDS does not change whether it is deployed alone or together with a firewall, the optimal configuration of a firewall has a lower detection rate (i.e., allowing more access) when it is deployed with an IDS than when deployed alone.

Yet there is little research on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce that takes a longitudinal approach. Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on consumer e-loyalty through satisfaction. Thus, this study extends our understanding of consumer Internet transaction behavior as a three-fold (prepurchase, purchase, and postpurchase) process, and it recognizes the crucial, multiple roles that trust plays in this process. Implications for theory and practice as well as limitations and future directions are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0188","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['trust', 'satisfaction', 'consumer relationships']","The article focuses primarily on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

There are large geographic variations, as well as variations across ethnic and racial lines. Prior research suggests that individual, household, and regional differences are responsible for this disparity. We argue for an alternative explanation: Individual choice is subject to social influence (\u201cpeer effects\u201d) that emanates from geographic proximity; this influence is the cause of the excess variation. We test this assertion with empirical analysis of a data set compiled from a number of sources. We find, first, that widespread Internet use among people who live in proximity has a direct effect on an individual's propensity to go online. Using data on residential segregation, we test the proposition that the Internet usage patterns of people who live in more ethnically isolated regions will more closely resemble usage patterns of their ethnic group. Finally, we examine the moderating impact of housing density and directly measured social interactions on the relationship between Internet use and peer effects. Results are consistent across analyses and provide strong evidence of peer effects, suggesting that individual Internet use is influenced by local patterns of usage.

Like most previous methods, the development and promotion of these methods have been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little participation from the research community during the early stages of evolution. While these methods are now the focus of more and more research efforts, most studies are still based on XP, Scrum, and other industry-driven foundations, with little or no conceptual studies of ISD agility in existence. As a result, this study proposes that there are a number of significant conceptual shortcomings with agile methods and the associated literature in its current state, including a lack of clarity, theoretical glue, parsimony, limited applicability, and naivety regarding the evolution of the concept of agility in fields outside systems development. Furthermore, this has significant implications for practitioners, rendering agile method comparison and many other activities very difficult, especially in instances such as distributed development and large teams that are not conducive to many of the commercial agile methods. This study develops a definition and formative taxonomy of agility in an ISD context, based on a structured literature review of agility across a number of disciplines, including manufacturing and management where the concept originated, matured, and has been applied and tested thoroughly over time. The application of the texonomy in practice is then demonstrated through a series of thought trials conducted in a large multinational organization. The intention is that the definition and taxonomy can then be used as a starting point to study ISD method agility regardless of whether the method is XP or Scrum, agile or traditional, complete or fragmented, out-of-the-box or in-house, used as is or tailored to suit the project context.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0236","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['agility', 'conceptual shortcomings', 'practitioners']","The article discusses the evolution of agile methods in information systems development but focuses primarily on technical and methodological aspects rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

The debate suffers from a lack of understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are used to study the processes of two software development teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From the cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility.

Although agile development methodologies offer the potential of improving software development outcomes, limited research has examined how project managers can structure the software development environment to maximize the benefits of agile methodology use during a project. As a result, project managers have little guidance on how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing that the most effective control modes are those that provide teams with autonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives, we propose hypotheses related to the interaction between control modes, agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the model in a field study of 862 software developers in 110 teams. The model explains substantial variance in four objective measures of project quality\u2014bug severity, component complexity, coordinative complexity, and dynamic complexity. Results largely support our hypotheses, highlighting the interplay between project control, agile methodology use, and requirements change.

For pairs of members with spatial boundaries and no temporal boundaries (those in different cities with overlapping work hours), synchronous communication technologies such as the telephone, instant messaging (IM), and Web conferencing provide a means for real-time interaction. However, for pairs of members with spatial and temporal boundaries (those in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours), asynchronous communication technologies, such as e-mail, provide a way to interact intermittently. Using survey data from 675 project members (representing 5,674 pairs of members) across 108 projects in a multinational semiconductor firm, we develop and empirically test a relational model of coordination delay. In our model, the likelihood of delay for pairs of members is a function of the spatial and temporal boundaries that separate them, as well as the communication technologies they use to coordinate their work. As expected, greater use of synchronous web conferencing reduces coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with overlapping work hours relative to pairs of members with nonoverlapping work hours. Unexpectedly, greater use of asynchronous e-mail does not reduce coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours, but rather reduces coordination delay for those with overlapping work hours. We discuss the implications of our findings that temporal boundaries are more difficult to cross with communication technologies than spatial boundaries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0239","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['coordination', 'communication', 'distributed projects']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of communication in globally distributed projects without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

This paper seeks to provide a deeper understanding of agility through an intensive study of the distributed ISD experience in TECHCOM, an organization widely recognized for its excellence in IT development and use. The study reveals that agility should be viewed as a multifaceted concept having three dimensions: resource, process, and linkage. Resource agility is based on the distributed development team's access to necessary human and technological resources. Process agility pertains to the agility that originates in the team's systems development method guiding the project, its environmental scanning, and sense-making routines to anticipate possible crises, and its work practices enabling collaboration across time zones. Linkage agility arises from the nature of interactional relationships within the distributed team and with relevant project stakeholders, and is composed of cultural and communicative elements. The paper highlights some of the difficulties in developing agility in distributed ISD settings, provides actionable tactics, and suggests contingencies wherein different facets of agility may become more (or less) critical.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0241","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['agility', 'cultural', 'collaboration', 'stakeholders']","The article discusses the importance of cultural and communicative elements in distributed teams, which suggests a recognition of diversity and collaboration across different contexts.

Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of flexibility. Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major impact on practice in this area.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0242","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['flexibility', 'agile', 'process design']","The article discusses flexibility in software development processes but does not emphasize social justice or critical theory.

We then develop an empirical data set describing the contract structures across these distinct dimensions, using a sample of 112 ITO contracts from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) database from 1993 to 2003. Drawing on transaction cost, agency, and relational exchange theories, we hypothesize the effects of transaction and relational characteristics on the specific contractual provisions, as well as on overall contract extensiveness.

An initial experiment using logical data models indicated that more expressive logical data models also enhanced end-user performance for information retrieval tasks. However, the principles of parsimony and bounded rationality imply that, past some point, increases in size lead to a level of complexity that results in impaired performance. The results of this study support these principles. For a logical data model of increased but still modest size, users composing queries for the more expressive logical data model did not perform as well as users composing queries for the corresponding less expressive but more parsimonious logical data model.

But such DSS are often not designed to help users understand and internalize the underlying factors driving DSS recommendations. Users then feel uncertain about DSS recommendations, leading them to possibly avoid using the system. We argue that a DSS must be designed to induce an alignment of a decision maker's mental model with the decision model embedded in the DSS. Such an alignment requires effort from the decision maker and guidance from the DSS. We experimentally evaluate two DSS design characteristics that facilitate such alignment: (i) feedback on the upside potential for performance improvement and (ii) feedback on corrective actions to improve decisions. We show that, in tandem, these two types of DSS feedback induce decision makers to align their mental models with the decision model, a process we call deep learning, whereas individually these two types of feedback have little effect on deep learning. We also show that deep learning, in turn, improves user evaluations of the DSS. We discuss how our findings could lead to DSS design improvements and better returns on DSS investments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0198","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['feedback', 'decision support systems', 'alignment']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of decision support systems and their performance rather than addressing social justice or ethical implications.

Empirical work in this area provides evidence that IT is associated with a decrease in vertical integration (VI). Economy-wide data, however, suggests that over the last 25 years the average level of VI has, in fact, increased. This paper studies this empirical anomaly by explicating the moderating impact of two measures of competitive environment, demand uncertainty, and industry concentration, on the relationship between IT and VI. We examine firms included in 1995 to 1997 InformationWeek 500 and the COMPUSTAT database. Consistent with the IS literature, the analysis suggests that IT is associated with a decrease in VI when demand uncertainty is high or industry concentration is low. However, contrary to the IS literature, IT is found to be associated with an increase in VI when industry concentration is high or demand uncertainty is low. Furthermore, as demand uncertainty increases, less vertically integrated firms invest more in IT, while as industry concentration increases, more vertically integrated firms invest more in IT. The analysis also suggests that firms' choice of the level of VI and IT investment, under different levels of demand uncertainty and industry concentration, are rational.

Because prior research argues that analysts' incentives to promote stocks increase in the extent to which the stock exhibits glamour characteristics, we predict that analysts are more likely to make income-increasing adjustments in determining street earnings for glamour stocks than for value stocks. We find that analysts are more likely to exclude expense items from street earnings for glamour stocks than for value stocks and that excluded expense items help predict future earnings for glamour stocks but not for value stocks. Overall, our results suggest that analysts' self-interest influences street earnings and this self-interest leads to street earnings that are less useful in predicting future earnings for glamour stocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00311.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on analysts' incentives and their impact on street earnings, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, inclusion, or ethical critiques.

We find that, despite market evidence that Inco Ltd.'s financial statements substantially overvalued the Voisey's Bay nickel mine throughout 1997 to 2000, management chose not to write down the mine until 2002. Inco management used an independent fairness opinion to justify its December 2000 redemption of the tracking stock at 25% of its initial value, indicating almost surely that Inco management was aware of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) impairment. This case illustrates that GAAP's reliance on undiscounted cash flows for impairment decisions allows huge unrecorded disparities between book and market value. The management discretion exercised in this case provides a concrete example of the subjectivity inherent in fair valuation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00314.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and management discretion without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The mandate is costly to firms but may yield benefits through lower information risk that translates into lower cost of equity. We use unaudited pre\u2013SOX 404 disclosures and SOX 404 audit opinions to assess how changes in internal control quality affect firm risk and cost of equity. After controlling for other risk factors, we find that firms with internal control deficiencies have significantly higher idiosyncratic risk, systematic risk, and cost of equity. Our change analyses document that auditor-confirmed changes in internal control effectiveness (including remediation of previously disclosed internal control deficiencies) are followed by significant changes in the cost of equity that range from 50 to 150 basis points. Overall, our cross-sectional and intertemporal change test results are consistent with internal control reports affecting investors' risk assessments and firms' cost of equity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00315.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal control and its impact on firm risk and cost of equity without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In anticipation of FAS 123-R, between March 2004 and November 2005, several firms accelerate the vesting of ESOs to avoid recognizing existing unvested ESO grants at fair value in future financial statements. We find that the likelihood of accelerated vesting is higher if (1) acceleration has a greater effect on future ESO compensation expense, especially related to underwater options, and (2) firms suffer greater agency problems, proxied by fewer blockholders, lower pension fund ownership, and top five officers holding a greater share of ESOs. We also find a negative stock price reaction around the announcement of the acceleration decision. Furthermore, stock returns are significantly negative before the new vesting dates and positive afterward, suggesting that vesting dates could have been backdated.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00316.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and financial implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This result is robust to alternative explanations documented in prior literature. However, after adjusting for transactions costs, the opportunity to earn profits by trading on this market anomaly is limited. We demonstrate that despite such clear adverse signals about the firm's continuing financial viability, this information is not being fully impounded by the market on a timely basis.

Securities laws remain an important determinant of whether and where securities are issued, how they are valued, who owns them, and where they trade. I show that there is a demand from entrepreneurs for mechanisms that allow them to commit to credible disclosure because disclosure helps reduce agency costs. Under some circumstances, mandatory disclosure through securities laws can help satisfy that demand, but only provided investors or the state can act on the information disclosed and the laws cannot be weakened ex post too much through lobbying by corporate insiders. With financial globalization, national disclosure laws can have wide-ranging effects on a country's welfare, on firms and on investor portfolios, including the extent to which share holdings reveal a home bias. In equilibrium, if firms can choose the securities laws they are subject to when they go public, some firms will choose stronger securities laws than those of the country in which they are located and some firms will do the opposite.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00327.x","keynote addresses","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of securities laws and financial globalization without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We argue that restatements contain news about the investment projects of the restating firms' competitors. This news causes competitors to revise their beliefs about the projects' value, and to modify their subsequent investment decisions. Accordingly, we hypothesize that changes in competitors' investments after restatement announcements are related to news in the restatements. Consistent with our prediction, we find that changes in competitors' investments following restatement announcements are significantly related to various proxies for news in the restatements, such as competitors' and restating firms' abnormal returns at the restatement announcements.

All of these effects are larger when earnings convey bad news or when the underlying bond is more risky. Taken together, our results suggest that the nonlinear payoff structure of bond securities affects the role of accounting earnings in the bond market.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00333.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting earnings and their impact on the bond market, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2009","47","3","MADHAV V.

We examine a setting wherein a firm makes a sequence of overlapping capacity investments. Earlier research has identified particular accrual accounting (depreciation) rules with the property that, on a per unit basis, the historical cost of a product captures precisely its marginal cost. Relative to this benchmark, we investigate and characterize the direction and magnitude of the bias in reported historical cost that results from alternative depreciation rules, including in particular straight-line depreciation in conjunction with partial direct expensing. In addition, we demonstrate that for a reasonable range of parameter specifications the resulting bias is rather small. Finally, we apply our framework to two specific settings. First, in a regulatory context, we establish the extent to which the accounting profit margin is indicative of a firm's pricing power in the product market. Second, we model an internal control scenario in which a manager's performance is evaluated using residual income, and identify the distortions in investment levels that result from the use of alternative depreciation rules.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00334.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We document that while both value relevance and compensation weight on earnings decline from the subperiod of 1993 to 1997 to the subperiod of 1998 to 2003, both value relevance and compensation weight on cash flows increase from the earlier subperiod to the later subperiod.

We develop the statistical and informational properties of accounting reports under varying degrees of conditional and unconditional accounting conservatism, consistent with Basu's [1997] description of differential verifiability standards. Optimal debt covenants and interest rates on debt are derived from a natural tension between debt holders and equity claimants. We show how optimal covenants vary with the degree of conservatism and derive an efficiency metric that depends on the degree of conservatism. We find that accounting conservatism actually decreases the efficiency of debt contracts, contrary to the suggestions of Watts [2003] and contrary to the hypothesis in numerous empirical studies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00336.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting conservatism and its impact on debt contracts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that analyst specialization by country and sector is sensitive to the extent to which firms within a country or sector and firms across country-sectors are exposed to common economic forces, the potential for revenue generation, and broker culture. Our tests indicate that existing research on the relation between analyst portfolio structure and forecast accuracy may suffer from an endogeneity bias. We use our analysis of analyst specialization to develop controls for this bias. Once we employ these controls, we find that country diversification is associated with superior forecast accuracy. However, the relation between sector diversification and forecast accuracy is context-specific. Specifically, sector diversification enhances forecast accuracy in an international context, while it detracts from forecast accuracy in a domestic U.S. context.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00338.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of analyst research and forecast accuracy without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are central to 'woke' themes."],["2009","47","4","D.

We find that the principal may choose centralization either to exercise better control over the agent's actions or to provide stronger incentives. Delegation emerges in equilibrium only if the costs of effort to acquire information for both the principal and the agent are sufficiently high. We find that increases in the principal's penalties for an incorrect decision may increase the principal's expected payoff, owing to optimal organizational responses. In addition, catastrophic risk, the risk of incorrectly accepting a defective audit (or product), may be greater under centralization than under delegation. Furthermore, catastrophic risk can be increased by well-intentioned legislative efforts to decrease such risk by, for example, increasing the agent's penalties for failing to take a corrective action, because the organizational structure may change.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00339.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making processes and organizational control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Based on a cross-country study of 37 manufacturing industries in 37 countries, we provide three pieces of related evidence. First, we find the contemporaneous correlations in industry growth rates across country pairs are higher when there is a greater level of corporate transparency in the country pairs, after controlling for country-level economic and financial development. Second, we find the influence of transparency on these correlations is stronger when country pairs are at similar levels of economic development (GDP). Finally, when we control for the level of transparency explained by a country's institutions in place, we find that residual transparency (unexplained by country-level factors) is associated with industry-specific growth rates.

In our model, workers possess information that is critical to efficient ongoing operations. An organizational design that motivates workers to optimally apply this information leverages both the production schedule and worker\u2013management communication. Management's use of these controls results in work-in-process (WIP) inventory that appears excessive from a pure job-scheduling perspective, but is optimal when control issues are considered. Empirical work testing pure job-scheduling theories of modern manufacturing practices has yielded mixed results. We provide control-related interpretations for these empirical findings, and also provide novel predictions regarding the link between inventory levels and the nature of operational information asymmetries.

Firms receive the reduced tax rate by electing to take an 85% dividends received deduction on repatriations in 2004 or 2005. This paper investigates the characteristics of firms that repatriate under the Act and how they use the repatriated funds. We find that firms that repatriate under the Act have lower investment opportunities and higher free cash flows than nonrepatriating firms. Further, we find that repatriating firms increase share repurchases during 2005 by approximately $60 billion more than nonrepatriating firms, an amount that cannot be explained by differences in earnings between the two groups of firms. This increase represents about 20% of the $291.6 billion repatriated by our sample firms under the Act.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00342.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of tax incentives and corporate financial behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

CFOs participate in decision making much like other executives, but they also have significant fiduciary responsibilities for reporting firms\u2019 financial results. Responsibility for financial reporting raises the question of whether it is appropriate to pay CFOs annual bonuses contingent on self-reported financial performance. In this paper, we provide a framework that characterizes CFO bonuses as a tradeoff between CFOs\u2019 decision-making responsibilities and their fiduciary duties over financial reporting. This framework yields a number of implications that we examine empirically using a proprietary survey of CFO compensation practices of public and private firms. Our main finding shows that from 2003 to 2007 public entities (relative to private entities) reduced the percentage of CFO bonuses contingent on financial performance. We interpret this result as evidence that firms mitigate misreporting practices in part by deemphasizing CFO incentive compensation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00343.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['fiduciary responsibilities', 'financial reporting', 'incentive compensation']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of CFO compensation and financial reporting without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

The Effect of Debt Contracting","We examine whether earnings reconciliation from U.K. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) convey information. As a result of debt contracting, mandatory accounting changes are expected to affect the likelihood of violating existing covenants based on rolling GAAP, leading to a redistribution of wealth between shareholders and lenders. Consistent with this prediction, we find significant market reactions to IFRS reconciliation announcements. These market reactions are more pronounced among firms that face a greater likelihood and costs of covenant violation and early announcements. While the association between later announcements and weaker market reactions is consistent with contractual implications of technical changes to earnings, which investors quickly learn to predict, it is inconsistent with IFRS forcing all firms in the sample to reveal firm-specific information through accruals. Thus, by showing that mandatory IFRS also affects debt contracting, we expand on existing IFRS research that focuses on how accounting quality and cost of capital are impacted.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00345.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and debt contracting without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that on average U.S. firms that disclosed material operations in at least one tax haven country have a worldwide tax burden on worldwide income that is approximately 1.5 percentage points lower than firms without operations in at least one tax haven country. Our results also show that U.S. firms face a 4.4% current federal tax rate on foreign income whether or not they have tax haven operations.

Erroneous Inferences Based on Earnings Frequency Distributions","A vast literature following Hayn [1995] and Burgstahler and Dichev [1997] attributed the so-called \u201cdiscontinuities\u201d in earnings distributions around zero to earnings management. Despite recent evidence that these discontinuities are likely caused by other factors, researchers and teachers continue to point to the shapes of these distributions as evidence of earnings management. We provide three sets of further evidence that these discontinuities are likely caused by factors other than earnings management: (1) we provide, as an example, a detailed analysis of the severe effects of sample selection in a recent study; this study erroneously concludes that the shape of an earnings distribution is evidence of earnings management, (2) we provide a simple explanation for the shape of the earnings distribution that is most often cited as evidence of earnings management; the relation between earnings and prices differs with the magnitude and the sign of earnings, and (3) we provide further examples that support the main point of our paper; evidence beyond the mere shape of a distribution must be brought to bear before researchers can draw conclusions regarding the presence/absence of earnings management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00347.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and statistical analysis without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

First, we document that the distribution of bond analysts' buy, hold, and sell recommendations is skewed positively, but less so than the distribution of equity analysts' recommendations. The positive skewness in bond analysts' recommendations is greater for low than for high credit quality bonds. Second, we find that bond analysts' reports generate bond trading and return reactions that are both economically significant and greater for low credit quality bonds. The bond market reaction is greater for bond analysts' reports than for equity analysts' reports. Finally, while both bond and equity analysts lead rating agency announcements, we find no evidence of a difference in timeliness between bond and equity analysts' reports. Overall, our results are consistent with bond analysts issuing more negative reports than equity analysts and providing more information about low credit quality bonds as a result of the asymmetric demand for negative information by bond investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00348.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of bond analysts' recommendations and their impact on bond securities, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If auditors or other interested parties (e.g., directors, lenders, investors, or regulators) can identify NFMs (e.g., facilities growth) that are correlated with financial measures (e.g., revenue growth), inconsistent patterns between the NFMs and financial measures can be used to detect firms with high fraud risk. We find that the difference between financial and nonfinancial performance is significantly greater for firms that committed fraud than for their nonfraud competitors. We also find that this difference is a significant fraud indicator when included in a model containing variables that have previously been linked to the likelihood of fraud.

Furthermore, the principal components of earnings and returns are highly correlated, implying aggregate earnings risks and return risks are related. In contrast to previous studies, the correlation we report between the systematic components of earnings and returns is stable over time. We also show that the earnings factors are priced, in the sense that the sensitivities of securities' returns to the earnings factors explain a significant portion of the cross-sectional variation in returns, even controlling for return risk. This suggests earnings performance is an underlying source of priced risk. Our evidence that the information sets of returns and earnings are jointly determined implies cash flow risk and return risk are not fully separable, and raises the possibility that it is the common variation of earnings and returns that is priced.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00351.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings and asset pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2009","35","1","Andrew D.

In particular, we propose that option set configuration, asymmetric dominance versus compromise, drives the decision process and whether consumers (consciously) focus on the chosen option or the context. This, in turn, affects the resulting decision process trace, as reflected in choice stability, confidence, and attribution. The results of five studies support this proposition.

We found that people were much more reluctant to enhance traits believed to be more fundamental to self-identity (e.g., social comfort) than traits considered less fundamental to self-identity (e.g., concentration ability). Moral acceptability of a trait enhancement strongly predicted people's desire to legalize the enhancement but not their willingness to take the enhancement.

When people make decisions about experiences to consume over time, they treat their memories of previous experiences as assets to be protected. The first two studies demonstrate that people tend to avoid situations that they believe will threaten their ability to retrieve special (rather than merely pleasant) memories. The next three studies demonstrate that people seek to obtain memory pointers to help them cue special memories at a later time when they anticipate interference from subsequent events. These preferences are driven by people's lay theories about the importance and difficulty of obtaining and retrieving special memories.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/715/1785170","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making related to memory and experience consumption without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

On the basis of a 5-year study primarily involving participant observation and interviewing, we present an analysis of how the clubbing experience is cocreated by promoters, DJs, and clubbers themselves. We develop and demonstrate a biosocial conceptualization of pleasure and show how the shared experience of music and dance, the organization of space, and the effects of the drug ecstasy combine to produce a highly sought-after, calculated suspension of the rules and norms of everyday life. Further, we suggest that the club, as well as the pleasurable practices and experiences that it supports, has become a site of contained illegality. Here, the illicit, subversive practices of rave have now become shepherded and channeled into more predictable, manageable, and regulated environments facilitated by the \u201cknowing wink\u201d of club promoters, police, and state authorities.

In each phase, we identify conditions under which self-control goals (indulgence or restriction goals) and trait self-control may either correspond or conflict. Three experiments demonstrate that when no trait-goal conflict occurs, categorization patterns and purchase intentions are consistent with self-control tendencies. However, when conflicts exist between trait self-control and goals, individuals engage in motivated categorization or revert to behaviors consistent with trait self-control. Interestingly, results suggest that either conflict resolution mechanism may undermine the likelihood of goal attainment.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/772/1785220","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-control', 'categorization', 'goals']","The article primarily focuses on goal-related categorization and self-control without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In four experiments, we find that consumers more strongly associate common attributes with early learned brands and unique attributes with late-learned brands. These findings imply an advantage for late entrants when unique attributes offer a higher value than attributes that are common to late and early entrants. We extend an attention-based model of associative learning to accommodate sequential learning of brand associations and predict when late versus early entrants will be able to sustain an advantage.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/788/1785225","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and brand associations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This selective hypothesis testing perspective on unrealistic optimism suggests that estimates of future behavior should be similar to those made by individuals who assume that conditions will be ideal. Moreover, consumers who initially provide estimates assuming that conditions will be ideal should recognize that the world is not ideal and so should test a more realistic hypothesis. In line with these predictions, we find that ideal-world estimates (e.g., In an ideal world, how often will you exercise next week?) do not differ from standard estimates (e.g., How often will you exercise next week?). We also find that individuals who initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make more realistic predictions.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/810/1785246","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and optimism without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In such situations, consumers often have the option not to choose any of the alternatives to avoid uncertainty. Alternatively, consumers can make inferences about the missing attributes. These inferences may occur spontaneously, or they may be strategically prompted. In five studies, it is shown that both explicitly and implicitly prompting consumers to make inferences about the missing attributes reduces the tendency to select the no-choice option and increases the likelihood of making a purchase decision. In parallel, consumers who generate spontaneous inferences are also less likely to defer their choices.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/823/1785257","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A chronically accessible independent self-construal was positively associated with country-level beer consumption (study 1a) and state-level problem alcohol consumption (study 1b). Experimentally primed independents reported more positive attitudes toward immediate beer consumption than did interdependents, and this effect was mediated by state impulsivity. Peer presence increased impulsive consumption tendencies for independents but decreased them for interdependents (studies 2 and 3). The moderating effect of self-construal was linked to greater motivation to suppress impulsive tendencies for interdependents than for independents (study 3).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/838/1785272","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on impulsive consumption behaviors without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

High-commitment consumers use a disconfirmatory processing strategy, focusing on the dissimilarities between their preferred brand and the competitor brand. Low-commitment consumers focus on the similarities between the advertised brand and their preferred brand. These processing differences lead to differences in the evaluation of a competitive brand between high- and low-commitment consumers. However, priming high-commitment consumers to focus on the similarities and low-commitment consumers on the dissimilarities between their preferred brand and a competitor brand mitigates the effects of the different processing strategies.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/5/851/1785280","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and brand evaluation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Five experiments with bilingual consumers show (1) that textual information (e.g., marketing slogans) expressed in consumers' native language tends to be perceived as more emotional than messages expressed in their second language, (2) that this effect is not uniquely due to the activation of stereotypes associated to specific languages or to a lack of comprehension, and (3) that the effect depends on the frequency with which words have been experienced in native- versus second-language contexts.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/6/1012/1799943","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['bilingualism', 'emotionality', 'consumer response', 'globalized marketplace']","The article discusses the impact of language on consumer responses in advertising, which touches on themes of cultural sensitivity and the emotional aspects of marketing.

Evaluations of the chosen brand were more favorable when individuals with a prevention focus used decision strategies that enhanced the accuracy of a decision outcome than when they used strategies that facilitated progress toward a decision, whereas the opposite outcome occurred for those with a promotion focus. These findings emerged whether the decision strategies were prompted by instructions about how to make a decision or by the message presentation format, and they were mediated by a subjective experience of confidence. These observations suggest that judgments are influenced by the decision makers' feelings about how information is processed that are independent of the message content.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/6/1026/1799948","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer decision-making processes and brand judgments without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

According to the proposed theory, a two-way interaction is predicted in which adding another similar alternative to the choice set leads to higher choice deferral without prior sale information but lower choice deferral with information about missing a larger sale on one of the alternatives. In addition, the new alternative in the choice set becomes more attractive and captures most of the market share. The results from three lab experiments and one field experiment confirm the hypotheses and the proposed mechanism. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/6/1039/1799956","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that increasing the number of elites in the top tier dilutes perceptions of status, while adding a subordinate tier enhances status. Tiers below the second tier do not affect those at the top but can make those in the tier immediately above feel more elite. Given the choice between alternative programs, those who do not qualify for status prefer hierarchies with multiple tiers.

Five studies demonstrate that because choosing from larger assortments is often more difficult, it leads people to select options that are easier to justify. Virtues and utilitarian necessities are generally easier to justify than indulgences; consequently, choosing from larger assortments often shifts choice from vices to virtues and from hedonic to utilitarian options. These effects reverse, however, when situational factors provide accessible reasons to indulge, underscoring the role of justification.

In some cases, an initial behavior is followed by a similar behavior. In other cases, an initial behavior is followed by an opposing behavior. We posit that a passive guidance system can nonconsciously guide behavior when there is goal conflict and, hence, determine whether a sequence of behaviors will be consistent or inconsistent. The passive guidance system is sensitive to whether a current behavior sustains goal activation and encourages similar future behaviors or results in goal achievement and encourages dissimilar future behaviors. Eight experiments provide evidence for this passive guidance system.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/6/967/1800032","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['goal conflict', 'behavior', 'passive guidance']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Findings support our hypotheses regarding the manner in which brand personality and attachment style differences systematically influence brand outcomes, including brand attachment, purchase likelihood, and brand choice. Results show that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to be differentially influenced by brand personalities. Further, the results indicate that the level of avoidance predicts the types of brand personality that are most relevant to anxious individuals. Specifically, under conditions of high avoidance and high anxiety, individuals exhibit a preference for exciting brands; however, under conditions of low avoidance and high anxiety, individuals tend to prefer sincere brands. The differential preference for sincere (vs. exciting) brand personality emerges in public (vs. private) consumption settings and in settings where interpersonal relationship expectations are high, supporting a signaling role of brand personality in these contexts.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/35/6/985/1800037","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['brand personality', 'attachment style', 'consumer behavior']","The article focuses on consumer behavior and brand personality without addressing social justice or ethical considerations.

Convex Compensation, Long Horizons, and Portfolio Choice","We study the portfolio choice of hedge fund managers who are compensated by high-water mark contracts. We find that even risk-neutral managers do not place unbounded weights on risky assets, despite option-like contracts. Instead, they place a constant fraction of funds in a mean-variance efficient portfolio and the rest in the riskless asset, acting as would constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investors. This result is a direct consequence of the in(de)finite horizon of the contract. We show that the risk-seeking incentives of option-like contracts rely on combining finite horizons and convex compensation schemes rather than on convexity alone.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01427.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio choice and compensation structures in finance without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

NYSE-listed Pilot stocks experience more symmetric trading patterns and a slight increase in spreads and intraday volatility after the suspension while there is a smaller effect on market quality for Nasdaq-listed Pilot stocks.

Consistent with the model, I find that after repurchases, employees and managers receive fewer stock option and equity grants, and that the market reacts favorably to repurchase announcements when employees have many unvested stock options. Managers are more likely to initiate share repurchases when employees hold a large stake in the firm. Moreover, since employees are forced to bear more risk in firms that repurchase shares, they exercise their stock options earlier and receive higher compensation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01430.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically share repurchases and their impact on employee compensation, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2009","64","1","JAMES R.

Two major differences are that hedge funds target more profitable firms than other activists, and hedge funds address cash flow agency costs whereas other private investors change the target's investment strategies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01432.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial performance and strategies of hedge funds and private investors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find a significant decrease in CEO compensation for firms that were more affected by these requirements, compared with firms that were less affected, taking into account unobservable firm effects, time-varying industry effects, size, and performance. The decrease in compensation is particularly pronounced in the subset of affected firms with no outside blockholder on the board and in affected firms with low concentration of institutional investors.

I argue that these differences are due to private equity being more costly than public equity. I further examine the private firms subsample to show that private equity is more costly than its public counterpart due to information asymmetry and the desire to maintain control.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01434.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital structure and financing without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

CEOs with more control pay their workers more, but financial incentives through cash flow rights ownership mitigate such behavior. Entrenched CEOs pay more to employees closer to them in the corporate hierarchy, geographically closer to the headquarters, and associated with conflict-inclined unions.

We define trading as more two-sided (one-sided) if the correlation between the number of buyer- and seller-initiated trades increases (decreases), and assess changes in sidedness (relative to a control sample) around events that identify trade initiators. Consistent with asymmetric information, trading is more one-sided before merger news. Consistent with belief heterogeneity, trading is more two-sided before earnings and macro announcements with greater dispersion in analyst forecasts, and after news with larger announcement surprises.

Theory has proposed that when private benefits are high, controlling shareholders are less likely to choose to cross-list in the United States because of constraints on the consumption of private benefits resulting from such listings. Using several proxies for private benefits related to the control and cash flow ownership rights of controlling shareholders, we find support for this hypothesis with a sample of more than 4,000 firms from 31 countries.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01438.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of cross-listing and private benefits of control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Moreover, prices of identical assets can diverge even if the constraints faced by arbitrageurs are not binding. Occasionally, total losses are large, making arbitrageurs' returns negatively skewed, consistent with the empirical evidence.

We compare the response to earnings announcements on Friday, when investor inattention is more likely, to the response on other weekdays. If inattention influences stock prices, we should observe less immediate response and more drift for Friday announcements. Indeed, Friday announcements have a 15% lower immediate response and a 70% higher delayed response. A portfolio investing in differential Friday drift earns substantial abnormal returns. In addition, trading volume is 8% lower around Friday announcements. These findings support explanations of post-earnings announcement drift based on underreaction to information caused by limited attention.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01447.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on investor behavior and stock returns without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Stable, bureaucratic firms with low growth potential are more likely to gain value from managerial diligence.

In general, level playing fields impose the standards of the weakest regulator upon the best-regulated economies. However, they may be desirable when capital is mobile because they counter a cherry-picking effect that lowers the size and efficiency of banks in weaker economies. Hence, while a laissez faire policy favors the better-regulated economy, level playing fields are good for weaker regulators.

A unilateral elimination of worldwide taxation by the United States is simulated to increase the proportion of parent firms locating in the United States following cross-border mergers and acquisitions from 53% to 58%.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01463.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of international taxation and its impact on cross-border mergers and acquisitions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes."],["2009","64","3","DARON ACEMOGLU,\u00a0\n                     DARON ACEMOGLUSearch for more papers by this authorSIMON JOHNSON,\u00a0\n                     SIMON JOHNSONSearch for more papers by this authorTODD MITTON,\u00a0\n                     TODD MITTON\n                     Acemoglu and Johnson are at MIT, and Mitton is at Brigham Young University.

We present a number of theoretical predictions on the interactions between financial development, contracting costs, and the extent of vertical integration. Consistent with these predictions, contracting costs and financial development by themselves appear to have no effect on vertical integration.

Anticipation of these merger opportunities can lead to defensive acquisitions, where managers acquire other firms to avoid losing private benefits if their firms are acquired, or \u201cpositioning\u201d acquisitions, where firms position themselves as more attractive takeover targets to earn takeover premia. The identity of acquirers and targets and the profitability of acquisitions depend on the distribution of firm sizes within an industry, among other factors.

This pattern cannot be generated by standard models that emphasize storage. We develop an equilibrium model of oil production in which investment is irreversible and capacity constrained. Investment constraints affect firms' investment decisions and imply that the supply elasticity changes over time. Since demand shocks must be absorbed by changes in prices or changes in supply, time-varying supply elasticity results in time-varying volatility of futures prices. Estimating this model, we show it is quantitatively consistent with the V-shape relationship between the volatility of futures prices and the slope of the forward curve.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01466.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of oil futures pricing and investment constraints without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We find that as this divergence widens, corporate cash holdings are worth less to outside shareholders, CEOs receive higher compensation, managers make shareholder value-destroying acquisitions more often, and capital expenditures contribute less to shareholder value. These findings support the agency hypothesis that managers with greater excess control rights over cash flow rights are more prone to pursue private benefits at shareholders\u2019 expense, and help explain why firm value is decreasing in insider excess control rights.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01477.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate governance and managerial behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We show theoretically that intertemporal trade-offs between interest income taxation and the cost of external finance determine optimal savings. Intriguingly, we find that, controlling for Tobin's q, saving and cash flow are negatively related because firms lower cash reserves to invest after receiving positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we estimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that income uncertainty affects saving more than do external finance constraints. Therefore, contrary to previous evidence, saving propensities reflect too many forces to be used to measure external finance constraints.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01478.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate finance and savings behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

If firms paid employees the same dollar value in wages instead of stock options, the average annual tax bill for large U.S. companies would increase by $12.6 million, or 9.8%. These direct tax benefits of options increase in the convexity of the tax function. In addition, profitable firms can realize indirect tax benefits because stock options increase debt capacity. Although tax minimization is probably not the main motive for option grants, firms with larger potential tax benefits grant more options.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01480.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the financial implications of employee stock options and tax benefits without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity and inclusion."],["2009","64","4","DMITRY LIVDAN,\u00a0\n                     DMITRY LIVDANSearch for more papers by this authorHORACIO SAPRIZA,\u00a0\n                     HORACIO SAPRIZASearch for more papers by this authorLU ZHANG,\u00a0\n                     LU ZHANG\n                     Dmitry Livdan is from the Walter A.

Quantitative results show that more financially constrained firms are riskier and earn higher expected stock returns than less financially constrained firms. Intuitively, by preventing firms from financing all desired investments, collateral constraints restrict the flexibility of firms in smoothing dividend streams in the face of aggregate shocks. The inflexibility mechanism also gives rise to a convex relation between market leverage and expected stock returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01481.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial constraints and risk in stock returns without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks with lottery features, and like lottery demand, the demand for lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks. Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks.

A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms' cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conflicts contribute to the increase.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01492.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial metrics and corporate cash management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused analysis."],["2009","64","5","LILY FANG,\u00a0\n                     LILY FANGSearch for more papers by this authorJOEL PERESS,\u00a0\n                     JOEL PERESS\n                     Lily Fang and Joel Peress are both at INSEAD.

We uncover another puzzling fact about the market for equity mutual funds: Funds with worse before-fee performance charge higher fees. This negative relation between fees and performance is robust and can be explained as the outcome of strategic fee-setting by mutual funds in the presence of investors with different degrees of sensitivity to performance. We also find some evidence that better fund governance may bring fees more in line with performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01497.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and fee structures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes, resulting in a score of 1."],["2009","64","5","CAMELIA M.

Hedge funds with greater managerial incentives, proxied by the delta of the option-like incentive fee contracts, higher levels of managerial ownership, and the inclusion of high-water mark provisions in the incentive contracts, are associated with superior performance. The incentive fee percentage rate by itself does not explain performance. We also find that funds with a higher degree of managerial discretion, proxied by longer lockup, notice, and redemption periods, deliver superior performance.

The discontinuity is absent in the 3 months culminating in an audit, suggesting it is not attributable to skillful loss avoidance.

The investor distraction hypothesis holds that extraneous news inhibits market reactions to relevant news. We find that the immediate price and volume reaction to a firm's earnings surprise is much weaker, and post-announcement drift much stronger, when a greater number of same-day earnings announcements are made by other firms. We evaluate the economic importance of distraction effects through a trading strategy, which yields substantial alphas.

This trend, however, reverses over a 3-year horizon. Additionally, firms reducing discretionary expenditures to beat forecasts have significantly greater equity issuances and insider selling in the following year, consistent with managers understanding the myopic nature of their actions.

However, when informed traders also observe prices, uninformed traders generate reversals by engaging in contrarian trading.

More generally, the results provide unusually clean evidence that catering influences corporate decisions, because the process of targeting nominal share prices is not well explained by alternative theories.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01511.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical theory related to stock prices and corporate decisions without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Moreover, auction theory suggests that toehold bidding may yield a competitive advantage over rival bidders. Nevertheless, with a sample exceeding 10,000 initial control bids for US public targets, we show that toehold bidding has declined steadily since the early 1980s and is now surprisingly rare. At the same time, the average toehold is large when it occurs (20%), and toeholds are the norm in hostile bids. To explain these puzzling observations, we develop and test a two-stage takeover model where attempted merger negotiations are followed by open auction. With optimal bidding, a toehold imposes a cost on target management, causing some targets to (rationally) reject merger negotiations. Optimal toeholds are therefore either zero (to avoid rejection costs) or greater than a threshold (so that toehold benefits offset rejection costs). The toehold threshold estimate averages 9% across initial bidders, reflecting in part the bidder's opportunity loss of a merger termination agreement. In the presence of market liquidity costs, a threshold of this size may well induce a broad range of bidders to select zero toehold. As predicted, the probability of toehold bidding decreases, and the toehold size increases, with the threshold estimate. The model also predicts a relatively high frequency of toehold bidding in hostile bids, as observed. Overall, our test results are consistent with rational bidder behavior with respect to the toehold decision.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X08001682","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of merger negotiations and bidding strategies without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Investigating the valuation differential between listed and non-listed firms (the cross-listing premium) from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for US exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, and that it persists when allowing for time-invariant unobservable firm characteristics. In contrast, no premium exists for listings on London's Main Market in any year.

To test these notions, we create an opacity index that ranks the relative transparency of the two thousand largest industrial US firms and find founder and heir ownership in 22% and 25% of these firms, respectively. Our analysis indicates that, in large, publicly traded companies, both founder and heir firms are significantly more opaque than diffuse shareholder firms.

Surprisingly, additional tests reveal that concerns about divergences in ownership versus control (management type, dual class shares, and board influence) appear to be substantially less important than corporate opacity in explaining the performance impacts of founder and heir control. Finally, we decompose corporate opacity into disclosure and market scrutiny components, finding that the disclosure quality component appears to be of greater importance to investors.

This accounting effect lowers demand for a firm's new equity, thereby raising underwriting costs and risk. Using a large sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), we show that poor accounting information quality is associated with higher flotation costs in terms of larger underwriting fees, larger negative SEO announcement effects, and a higher probability of SEO withdrawals.

We show that differences in popularity between bidder and target help to explain their pairing. The merger with a more popular target generates a halo effect from the target to the bidder that induces the market to evaluate the assets of the less popular bidder at the (inflated) market value of the more popular target. Both bidder and target premiums are positively related to the difference in popularity between the target and the bidder. However, the target's ability to appropriate the gain is reduced by the fact that its bargaining position is weaker when the bidder's potential for asset appreciation is higher.

Between 1985 and 1991, 30 states in the U.S. enacted business combination (BC) laws, raising the cost of corporate takeovers. Relying on these exogenous events, we estimate the influence of the market for corporate control on the cost of debt. We identify different channels through which an open market for corporate control can benefit or harm bondholders: a reduction in managerial slack or the \u201cquiet life,\u201d resulting in higher profitability and firm value; a coinsurance effect, in which firms become less risky after being acquired; and an increasing leverage effect, in which bondholder wealth is expropriated through leverage-increasing takeovers.

Second, international attention has a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationship with MNE performance.

Our results strongly support the semi-globalization perspective in that the regional-level effects are significant and different from the country-level effects for all foreign subsidiaries, for wholly owned subsidiaries and for jointly owned subsidiaries.

When examining two-way knowledge flows or spillovers between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and other actors in specific locations, the diversity or heterogeneity of firms matters, as does the diversity of locational environments. The localization of knowledge sources depends on MNE group-level strategies for growth and organizational decentralization, on subsidiary-level evolution towards local competence-creating efforts, and on the development of suitable business networks within locations. MNEs now have a greater potential to benefit from a synergistic locational portfolio of complementary sources of knowledge. The locational composition of the international network for knowledge sourcing of a given MNE depends upon the extent of institutional compatibility between the locations in which the MNE is active.

This is called brand specificity, a special case of asset specificity that drives up the cost of conducting the manufacturer\u2013retailer transaction, especially when the parties are located in different nations. With the right to brand a product being shifted from manufacturers to retailers, private branding can eliminate this problem of brand specificity that inflicts a transaction cost penalty on offshore outsourcing, which is why the two seemingly unrelated retail trends coexist. Data obtained from a national chain reveal that the retailer is more likely to brand a product that needs its marketing efforts, but less motivated to outsource the product offshore before putting a private brand on it.

In this study we compare the influence of both domestic economic uncertainty and exchange rate uncertainty on the real option value of international investments of Korean firms over 16 years of varying uncertainty. We find evidence that an international investment network characterized by greater breadth and lower depth is associated with higher firm value under domestic economic uncertainty.

When state ownership shifts from majority and controlling to minority and non-controlling, the performance impact may be positive in the short run, particularly where there is instability in the local investment policy environment. Consistent with this proposition, we develop and test hypotheses derived from a minority and non-controlling or \u201cresidual\u201d state ownership framework, grounded in credible privatization and institutional theory. We propose that: (1) residual state ownership positively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because it signals state support for managerial initiatives; (2) the passage of time since initial privatization negatively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because initial undertakings in support of the privatizing firm are reversed; and (3) home-country investment policy stability moderates these two effects \u2013 greater stability obviates the need for residual state ownership, and slows policy reversals over time. We find empirical support for our residual state ownership framework in event study analyses of cumulative abnormal returns (\u201cCARs\u201d) associated with 196 major investments announced from 1986 to 2001 by 15 privatizing telecoms from around the world. CARs are positive at 5\u201325% state ownership levels but turn negative at higher state ownership levels. CARs turn sharply negative within 1\u20132 years from initial privatization dates. Increasing policy stability diminishes positive ownership and negative time effects on CARs. Results confirm the potential supporting role that residual state ownership can play in enhancing strategic decision-making and financial performance by privatizing firms, particularly where there is instability in the home-country investment policy environment.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2008.104","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['state ownership', 'privatization', 'shareholder value']","The article primarily focuses on financial performance and shareholder value, with limited reference to social themes.

The length of trial has great importance, because licensing duration represents part of the licensing agreement. When it is too short, the firm may not acquire the necessary experience and knowledge of the foreign market, but if it is too long, the firm misses optimal expansion timing. Arguing that licensing can be considered as a European-style real option with a fixed holding period, we develop and test a model of the determinants of licensing duration in foreign markets. Empirical results based on a sample of firms in various countries show that uncertainty and threat of competitive pre-emption in the foreign market are related to shorter duration of the technology licensing agreements.

We analyze existing theories of interdependence to examine the extent to which they provide guidance for understanding the interaction and communication requirements between work segments that are offshored and distributed across the globe.

The second perspective (social learning) also grants an independent effect to social interaction as a main factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge flows. We formulate hypotheses based on both perspectives, and test these on data from 169 MNE subsidiaries. Our findings show a considerable main effect of social interaction on all intra-MNE knowledge flows, confirming the expectations based on the social learning model.

While OECD firms gain from both vertical and (probably) horizontal linkages, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese firms benefit only from backward linkage effects. In the domestic sector, in which we are most interested, both state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs are hurt by competition from foreign firms in the same industries.

Both R&D and export intensities have a positive effect on the sales growth of newly listed firms. However, R&D intensity is path dependent, and is determined by levels of accumulated intangible assets and debt. In terms of time dynamics, the growth of IPO firms is at its highest level just after the float, whereas export intensity increases as IPO firms mature.

We offer a model that postulates that cultural distance relates negatively to international acquisition performance because it taxes integration capabilities during international acquisitions, but that cultural distance also elevates the positive association of integration capabilities and international acquisition performance because it provides more learning opportunities that can only be exploited with strong integration capabilities. Empirical tests with a sample of international acquisitions by 118 US multinational companies provide support for the proposed model. On one hand, we find that cultural distance impedes understandability of key capabilities that need to be transferred, and constrains communication between acquirers and their acquired units, bringing about a negative indirect effect on acquisition performance. On the other hand, we find that cultural distance enriches acquisitions by enhancing the positive effects of understandability and communication on acquisition performance. Acquirers that can overcome the impeding effects of cultural distance on understanding key capabilities and effective communication appear to reap significant performance gains.

By looking at the relative efficiency of the different markets in which MNE and complementary local assets are traded, and at how these two categories of assets match, I am able to predict whether equity will be held by MNEs or by local firms, or shared between them, and whether MNEs will enter through greenfields, brownfields, or acquisitions.

In this paper we assess both the opportunism concept and existing alternatives such as trust within the context of IB research, especially work on multinational enterprise (MNE) governance. Case analyses of nine global MNEs illustrate an alternative to the opportunism assumption that captures more fully the mechanisms underlying failed commitments inside the MNE. As a substitute for the often-criticized assumption of opportunism, we propose the envelope concept of bounded reliability (BRel), an assumption that represents more accurately and more completely the reasons for failed commitments, without invalidating the other critical assumption in conventional TCE (and internalization theory) thinking, namely the widely accepted envelope concept of bounded rationality (BRat). Bounded reliability as an envelope concept includes two main components, within the context of global MNE management: opportunism as intentional deceit, and benevolent preference reversal.

This centrality notwithstanding, the fact is that internalization coheres with lower-powered incentives and carries an implicit drawback, namely, higher realized production costs. With the emergence and deployment of information and communication technology (ICT), modern MNEs are reshaping their transnational governance to address this cost. The modern MNE uses ICT to mitigate transaction costs, and evolves more to arm's length exchange to incentivize lower production costs. A testable prediction is that MNEs in industries more susceptible to and employing more ICT will exhibit a reduced propensity for transnational integration. We examine this hypothesis using available data from 1982 to 1997 for US MNEs across all manufacturing sectors. Regression results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with the prediction. This study, a first to explore empirically the role of ICT in the evolution of transnational exchange, suggests that MNE theory, until now founded primarily on transaction cost economics and a cross-border control theory of value capture, is more likely to keep pace with developments in MNE practice by opening up to incentive theories of exchange governance and a cross-border coordination theory of value creation.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2009.55","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of multinational enterprises and the role of information technology in reducing costs, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2009","40","9","Art Durnev1, Vihang Errunza1 & Alexander Molchanov2","Property rights protection, corporate transparency, and growth","In countries with secure property rights, corporate transparency improves investment efficiency and increases growth by alleviating information asymmetry.

Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have proposed many theories about the drivers of such innovation, including government policy and labor, capital, and culture at the national level. The authors contrast these theories with one based on the corporate culture of the firm. They test their theory using survey and archival data from 759 firms across 17 major economies of the world. The results suggest the following: First, among the factors studied, corporate culture is the strongest driver of radical innovation across nations; culture consists of three attitudes and three practices. Second, the commercialization of radical innovations translates into a firm's financial performance; it is a stronger predictor of financial performance than other popular measures, such as patents.

In particular, how do customer value creation (through product innovation) and customer value communication (through marketing investments) affect stock returns? This article examines, conceptually and empirically, how product innovations and marketing investments for such product innovations lift stock returns by improving the outlook on future cash flows. The authors address these questions with a large-scale econometric analysis of product innovation and associated marketing mix in the automobile industry. They find that adding such marketing actions to the established finance benchmark model greatly improves the explained variance in stock returns. In particular, investors react favorably to companies that launch pioneering innovations, that have higher perceived quality, that are backed by substantial advertising support, and that are in large and growing categories. Finally, the authors quantify and compare the stock return benefits of several managerial control variables. The results highlight the stock market benefits of pioneering innovations. Compared with minor updates, pioneering innovations have an impact on stock returns that is seven times greater, and their advertising support is nine times more effective as well. Perceived quality of the new car introduction improves the firm's stock returns, but customer liking does not have a statistically significant effect. Promotional incentives have a negative effect on stock returns, indicating that price promotions may be interpreted as a signal of demand weakness. Managers can combine these return estimates with internal data on project costs to help decide the appropriate mix of product innovation and marketing investment.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.024","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the financial impacts of product innovations and marketing investments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a non-competitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.093","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the competitive dynamics of loyalty programs in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The study tests the effect of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population. It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups invovled the majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However, higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more to complement regulatory and economic tools.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.2.105","research article","JM","Marketing","7","['minorities', 'demarketing', 'social identity', 'environment', 'national attachment']","The article discusses the intersection of environmental protection and minority consumer behavior, emphasizing social identity and the impact of national attachment on responses to demarketing campaigns.

The authors test the OI-transfer research model in two multinational studies using multilevel and multisource data. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses show that the OI-transfer process takes place in the relationships between business unit managers and salespeople and between regional directors and business unit managers. Furthermore, both leader-follower dyadic tenure and charismatic leadership moderate this cascading effect. Leaders with a mismatch between their charisma and OI ultimately impair followers\u2019 OI. In turn, customer-contact employees\u2019 OI strongly predicts their sales performance. Finally, both employees\u2019 and sales managers\u2019 OI are positively related to their business units\u2019 financial performance.

A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers\u2019 perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and experience goods, but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular, experience goods involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth (total number of pages) of search than search goods.

It is argued that PPS leads to faster delivery of service to a broader cross-section of customers than customer-initiated postsales service, or reactive postsales service. The authors argue that mental frames of customers and suppliers engaged in PPS are more positive and open than mental frames of those engaged in customer-initiated service. On the basis of nine focus groups with 94 managers in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer settings, the authors propose three main dimensions of PPS: (1) proactive prevention, (2) proactive education, and (3) proactive feedback seeking. They argue that PPS leads not only to favorable customer-level outcomes (e.g., customer satisfaction) but also to favorable supplier-level outcomes (e.g., greater innovativeness, new product success rate). The authors propose that the value of PPS varies depending on the product's life-cycle stage, its transaction extensiveness, and network externality. In addition, the value of PPS varies depending on a customer's usage intensity, openness to experience, and market mavenism. Some key challenges with PPS pertain to implementation issues, such as privacy intrusion, expectation escalation, user identification, and contact routinization. If neglected, these can result in PPS leading to negative rather than positive outcomes.

Prior literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as \u201chardware\u201d) largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often referred to as \u201csoftware\u201d). Mathematical and empirical analyses have almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence, case illustrations show that certain high-quality, \u201csuperstar\u201d software titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales by an average of 14% (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the hardware required to use the software. Software type does not consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase hardware sales. Hardware firms\u2019 exclusivity over superstars does not provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.2.88","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses purely on the technical aspects of software and hardware sales in system markets, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Thus, a person can adopt a brand either as a result of communication with adopters of that brand (within-brand influence) or as a result of an interaction with adopters of competing brands (cross-brand influence). This study shows that the interplay between within- and cross-brand influence can have a substantial effect on the growth of markets under competition. The authors develop a model that explicitly represents these two influences and focus on the case of two otherwise identical competing brands with different entry times. As a result of within-brand influence, current customers create an interaction-based advantage for the first entrant, which grows with time. Thus, we illustrate how customers should be viewed as market assets who yield increasing returns during the diffusion process. Conversely, cross-brand influence enables a market follower to enjoy a shorter takeoff time. Given the combination of both, the authors predict the \u201cdual pattern,\u201d characterized by a fast takeoff for a follower, followed by a widening gap in favor of the first entrant, all else being equal. They show that such a pattern dominated the market growth of the cellular industry in Western Europe. They explain the reasons behind this dual pattern, rule out straightforward alternative explanations, and discuss the managerial implications.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.3.019","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brand communication and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Antecedents and Consequences","The firm\u2013customer exchange process consists of three key parts: (1) firm-initiated marketing communications, (2) customer buying behavior, and (3) customer product return behavior. To date, the literature in marketing has largely focused on how marketing communications affect customer buying behavior and, to some extent, how past buying behavior affects a firm's decisions to initiate future marketing communications. However, the literature on product returns is sparse, especially in relation to analyzing individual customer product return behavior. Although the magnitude of the value of product returns is known to be high ($100 billion per year), how it affects customer buying behavior is not known because of a lack of data availability and understanding of the role of product returns in the firm\u2013customer exchange process. Given that product returns are considered a hassle for a firm's supply chain management and a drain on overall profitability, it is important to study product return behavior. Thus, the authors empirically demonstrate the role of product returns in the exchange process by determining the exchange process factors that help explain product return behavior and the consequences of product returns on future customer and firm behavior.

These consumers are drawn to premium brands in part because of the exclusivity and connotation of prestige associated with them. These characteristics are also the reason such brands are attractive targets of counterfeiting. When premium brands are counterfeited, which in turn gives a variety of consumers access to them, how do consumers of the genuine items react to the erosion of exclusivity and prestige? An investigation involving premium brands in Thailand and India reveals that consumers of genuine items adopt one of three strategies when faced with the prospect of their favorite brands being counterfeited: flight (abandoning the brand), reclamation (elaborating the pioneering patronage of a brand), and abranding (disguising all brand cues). The author examines these strategies in detail, revealing how the potential loss of exclusivity and prestige can either drive genuine-item consumers away from the brand or impel them to make strong claims to their patronage.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.3.086","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['counterfeiting', 'brand', 'exclusivity']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and brand management in the context of counterfeiting, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Recent research on emotional branding, together with prior work on brands\u2019 symbolic nature and their role as relationship partners, represents a significant shift in the way marketers think about brands and brand management. However, a full understanding of powerful and emotionally resonant brands has been elusive, in part because sociocultural branding knowledge has accumulated in a piecemeal way and lacks coherence and integrity. In addition, powerful brands are extraordinarily complex and multifaceted, but in general they have been studied from a single perspective in a single setting. On the basis of a qualitative exploration of the American Girl brand that is both deep and broad, the authors posit that an emotionally powerful brand is best understood as the product of a complex system, or gestalt, whose component parts are in continuous interplay and together constitute a whole greater than their sum.

In particular, self-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers\u2019 responses are private in nature; in contrast, other-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers are publicly accountable for their responses. This effect is moderated by norm salience and is related to a desire to manage impressions by behaving in a manner consistent with normative expectations.

A key assumption is that customized products create higher benefits for customers than standard products because they deliver a closer preference fit. The prerequisite for this effect is the ability to obtain precise information on what customers actually want. But are customers able to specify their preferences that precisely? Several theoretical arguments raise doubts about this, implicitly challenging the value of customization. The authors conduct two studies in which they find that products customized on the basis of expressed preferences bring about significantly higher benefits for customers in terms of willingness to pay, purchase intention, and attitude toward the product than standard products. The benefit gain is higher if customers have (1) better insight into their own preferences, (2) a better ability to express their preferences, and (3) greater product involvement. This suggests that customization has the potential to be a powerful marketing strategy if these conditions are met. In the opposite case, firms willing to serve heterogeneous customer preferences need to adapt their customization systems in such a way that they explicitly address the customers\u2019 inability to provide valid preference information.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.5.103","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['customization', 'preferences', 'marketing strategy']","The article primarily focuses on the marketing strategy of customization and its effectiveness in meeting customer preferences, without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The results indicate that, in general, marketing alliance announcements create value (i.e., abnormal stock returns) for the firm in the announcement period event window. Furthermore, network efficiency and network density have the strongest positive impact when they are moderate; network reputation and network centrality have no effect. These results point to the greater role of relational network characteristics than size-/status-based benefits. Finally, marketing alliance capability, which reflects a firm's ability to manage a network of previous marketing alliances, has a positive impact on value creation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.5.52","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['firm value', 'network', 'marketing alliances']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of marketing alliances and their impact on firm value, with no significant mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.5.70","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['customer dynamics', 'value', 'segmentation']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of customer portfolio management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because social network sites record the electronic invitations from existing members, outbound WOM can be precisely tracked. Along with traditional marketing, WOM can then be linked to the number of new members subsequently joining the site (sign-ups). Because of the endogeneity among WOM, new sign-ups, and traditional marketing activity, the authors employ a vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach. Estimates from the VAR model show that WOM referrals have substantially longer carryover effects than traditional marketing actions and produce substantially higher response elasticities. Based on revenue from advertising impressions served to a new member, the monetary value of a WOM referral can be calculated; this yields an upper-bound estimate for the financial incentives the firm might offer to stimulate WOM.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.5.90","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of marketing effectiveness without addressing any social justice themes, DEI, or ethical considerations.

To help answer this question, the authors examine the interplay between in-store and out-of-store factors on consumer attention to and evaluation of brands displayed on supermarket shelves. Using an eye-tracking experiment, they find that the number of facings has a strong impact on evaluation that is entirely mediated by its effect on visual attention and works particularly well for frequent users of the brand, for low-market-share brands, and for young and highly educated consumers who are willing to trade off brand and price. They also find that gaining in-store attention is not always sufficient to drive sales. For example, top- and middle-shelf positions gain more attention than low-shelf positions; however, only top-shelf positions carry through to brand evaluation. The results underscore the importance of combining eye-tracking and purchase data to obtain a full picture of the effects of in-store and out-of-store marketing at the point of purchase.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.6.1","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing effectiveness without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors draw on a theoretical conceptualization of brand extension success and present an approach to measure the monetary value of brand extension rights in the context of motion pictures (i.e., movie sequel rights) and to calculate the effect of variations of key extension product attributes, such as the continued participation of stars, on this value. Their measure incorporates both the forward spillover effect and the reciprocal spillover effect and accounts for differences between brand extensions and new original products in revenues and risk, thereby offering marketing scholars a novel approach for evaluating the riskiness of investment alternatives. With respect to the forward spillover effect of a parent brand on the extension product, the authors apply regression analysis to data from all 101 initial movie sequels released in North American theaters between 1998 and 2006 and to a matched subsample of original movies and calculate the risk-adjusted monetary brand extension value by comparing success predictions for both sequels and matched original movies. Regarding the reciprocal spillover effect by which the extension product affects the success of the parent brand, the authors use longitudinal data of parent-brand DVD sales to monetize the risk-adjusted impact of the brand extension on the parent.

However, little attention has been given to understanding the impact of customer satisfaction on the risk of stock returns. The finance literature suggests that investors that judge performance only in terms of returns place more resources than warranted in risky opportunities, forgo profitable opportunities, and apply misguided performance evaluations. Accordingly, this study develops, tests, and finds empirical support for the hypotheses that positive changes (i.e., improvement) in customer satisfaction result in negative changes (i.e., reduction) in overall and downside systematic and idiosyncratic risk. Using a panel data sample of publicly traded U.S. firms and satisfaction data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the study demonstrates that investments in customer satisfaction insulate a firm's stock returns from market movements (overall and downside systematic risk) and lower the volatility of its stock returns (overall and downside idiosyncratic risk). The results are robust to alternative measures of risk, model specifications, and concerns related to sample composition criteria raised in some recent studies. Therefore, the results indicate that customer satisfaction is a metric that provides valuable information to financial markets. The robust impact of customer satisfaction on stock returns risk indicates that it would be useful for firms to disclose their customer satisfaction scores in their annual report to shareholders.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.6.184","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['customer satisfaction', 'risk', 'financial markets']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between customer satisfaction and stock returns risk, emphasizing financial metrics rather than social themes.

This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing\u2013finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the \u201cgoodwill refund\u201d of CSP is not unconditional.

In managing the recall process, some firms adopt a proactive strategy in responding to consumer complaints, while others are more passive. In this study, the authors examine the impact of these strategic alternatives on firm value using Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls during a 12-year period from 1996 to 2007. Using the event study method, the authors show that regardless of firm and product characteristics, proactive strategies have a more negative effect on firm value than more passive strategies. An explanation for this surprising result is that the stock market interprets proactive strategies as a signal of substantial financial losses to the firm. When a firm proactively manages a product recall, the stock market infers that the consequence of the product-harm crisis is sufficiently severe that the firm had no choice but to act swiftly to reduce potential financial losses. Therefore, firms dealing with product recalls must be sensitive to how investors might interpret a proactive strategy and be aware of its potential drawbacks.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.6.214","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['product-recall', 'consumer complaints', 'proactive strategy']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of product-recall strategies rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

The authors argue that it is equally important to understand how marketing decisions can reduce firm value. Prior research has indicated that negative events vary greatly in their indirect costs to the firm. On the basis of established theory and in-depth interviews with practitioners, the authors identify a set of factors that can explain the heterogeneity in the magnitude of indirect costs associated with negative marketing-related events. Specifically, they address how the regulatory exposure of deceptive marketing, which carries no direct cost to the firm, affects shareholder value. Using an event study, the analysis shows that incidents of exposed deceptive marketing are associated with significant, negative abnormal returns amounting to a drop of 1%, which translates into a wealth loss of $86 million for the median-sized firm in the sample. In explaining the variation in magnitude of the impact between events, the authors find that, in general, event characteristics are more significant than firm and brand characteristics. When deception is highly egregious or directed at vulnerable populations, firm value is more negatively affected than when the potential to mislead and harm is not readily verifiable. Furthermore, when the cited product has substantial brand market share, the levels of egregiousness and target audience explain substantially more of the variation in event impact than when brand market share is low. The results are robust to alternative stock-portfolio-based measures of abnormal returns, model specification, heteroskedasticity, and examination of risk.

Research has focused on linking marketing activities and resource deployments with returns but has largely neglected marketing's role in determining risk. Yet the theoretical literature asserts that investments in market-based assets, such as brands, should lead to reductions in firm risk. Adopting risk measures that are well established in the finance literature, the authors use credit ratings to capture debt-holder risk and the standard deviation of stock returns to measure equity-holder risk, which they then decompose into systematic and unsystematic equity risk. The authors examine the impact of consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) on firm risk using data covering 252 firms from EquiTrend, COMPUSTAT, and the Center for Research in Security Prices over the 2000\u20132006 period. They find that a firm's CBBE is associated with firm risk and explains variance in the risk measures beyond that explained by existing finance models (i.e., it has \u201crisk relevance\u201d). They also find that CBBE has a stronger role in predicting firm-specific unsystematic risk than systematic risk but that it also has a particularly strong role in protecting equity holders from downside systematic risk. The results have clear economic significance and suggest that managers should make brand management part of the firm's risk management strategy and protect or even increase CBBE investments during periods of economic uncertainty.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.6.47","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the relationship between brand equity and firm risk, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The authors use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate cost and profit efficiencies and employ hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effect of CRM implementation on cost and profit efficiencies. They find that CRM implementation is associated with a decline in cost efficiency but an increase in profit efficiency. A firm-level factor, CRM commitment, reduces the negative effect of CRM implementation on cost efficiency. The authors also find that two adoption-related factors, time of adoption and time since adoption, influence the relationship between CRM implementation and cost and profit efficiencies. Early adopters benefit less from CRM implementation than late adopters. However, time since adoption improves the performance of firms that implement CRM.

Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing.

The authors examine the paychecks drawn by people in more than 14,000 selling jobs and more than 4000 sales management jobs in five B2B industry sectors in five European countries. They show that pay levels and structures reflect an apparent balancing of two conflicting pressures: the economic imperative (to reward better performers by heightening pay dispersion) and the compensation differential compression resulting from high tax regimes. In particular, B2B firms appear to use variable pay as a way to lessen the salary differential compression impact of high tax regimes on salesperson motivation.

Purchase and promotion history are incorporated to map the dynamic competitive interactions among the firms sending the mailings. The authors investigate the impact of direct mailings on the revenues of each firm and its competitors over time. The model accounts for endogeneity of the mailing decision and for unobserved heterogeneity across households. The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities.

They find that the underlying mechanism for this effect is imagination's impact on the perceived value of new benefits rather than on the learning costs. Furthermore, they show that the advantage of an imaginative focus is not simply due to the increased focus on product benefits, because imagination still leads to higher product evaluation than memory-focused visualization, even if participants in both conditions are asked to think about product benefits exclusively.

The results from a set of experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices. Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 \u2013 3.96, an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations (e.g., 5.00 \u2013 4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00).

Empirical analysis of historical data on 19 categories shows that though both quality and network effects affect market share flows, in general markets are efficient.

In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms in a competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential.

Extending recent research on store choice, they add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore, optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices, the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.176","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of grocery store choice related to product assortments, prices, and convenience without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The analysis constitutes a scenario in which capacity-constrained firms set prices conditional on their location, demand, and costs. This enables firms to develop maps of latent demand patterns across the market in which they compete. The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95% spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability by 66% over a model that ignores these effects.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.260","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outlet pricing and location analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors examine the related but previously unaddressed issue of whether the unexpected exit of an option from a choice set returns the choice shares of the original options to the status quo. In a series of experiments, they observe that when an option turns out to be unselectable following a choice problem in which it was selectable, the choice shares of the remaining options are predictably different from those of a choice problem in which the option was unselectable from the start. They also observe that this attraction effect due to the disappearance of a decoy is likely a consequence of changes in the importance of decision criteria. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the research.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.330","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice dynamics and decision-making processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This research examines the implications of the interplay between these two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to a single underlying resource used for self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context. Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation activities but rather extends to choice in general.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.344","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making processes and resource depletion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The extant marketing theory predicts that the optimal prize structure should have two characteristics: (1) The number of prizewinners should be greater than one, and (2) prize values should be unique and rank ordered. However, this theory has not been empirically examined. This article presents two empirical studies that examine whether the prize structure of a sales contest affects sales performance. In each study, the authors investigate the incremental effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one.

However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain.

However, when an advertisement is intended to induce consumers to benefit someone else (e.g., to donate money for relief of disaster victims), stimulating them to imagine themselves in the situation confronting the beneficiary can sometimes conflict with the image they form of themselves as a potential helper. This conflict in imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness. Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help, characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the amount of money they donated.

They calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased packaged goods markets. These data are ideal in the sense that they have the necessary variation to identify switching costs separately from consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes the results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching costs.

These regressions use the results of the initial model to correct for the endogeneity of observed market structures. The results from both exercises illustrate several important asymmetries across the firms. Kmart and Wal-Mart prefer similar markets, but Wal-Mart's competitive position is dominant enough to prevent Kmart's operation in otherwise attractive markets. In contrast, Target prefers substantially different market characteristics.

In the credit card business, all customers are not equally risky. When a customer misses one payment on a credit card bill, a signal is sent to the credit card company. It is important for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different consumer types.

In the fast-growing high-tech and entertainment industries, products from complementary categories are often incompatible with one another. This research shows that when choosing a pair of such complementary products, a consumer is likely to use a two-stage decision strategy: screening by one category first to narrow down the number of pairs for further evaluation in the second stage. In the presence of incompatibility, screening by one category rather than by the other may lead to different choice outcomes. The authors develop a behavioral theory\u2013driven choice model that accounts for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 \u00d7 2 conjoint choice experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their decision goals.

The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's \u201ccontrol function\u201d approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated.

Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of high (versus low) trustworthiness also produce quicker and more efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits. However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad.

These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for motivating service employees.

Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and when the component supplier has made significant component customization investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the \u201cwrong\u201d contract form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in nature.

The authors apply this model to decisions by managers at 2233 Internet service providers of whether to offer their customers access through 56K modems in 1997. The model is validated by showing that firms with a higher estimated probability of strategic thinking were more likely to have survived through April 2007. The estimation results show considerable heterogeneity in the degree to which firms behave strategically and suggest that strategic ability affects marketing outcomes; specifically, a simulated increase in strategic ability means that fewer firms offer the technology to their customers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.612","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['managers', 'strategic thinking', 'heterogeneity']","The article primarily focuses on strategic decision-making and economic modeling without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They show that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying significant losses for brand manufacturers. Finally, an examination of 26 global companies shows that stock price performance is lower for companies that exhibit stronger procyclical advertising spending patterns.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.623","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['sensitivity', 'social', 'managerial', 'losses']","The article discusses the social and managerial losses associated with advertising spending patterns, indicating a consideration of broader societal impacts.

The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions, accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country, the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects.

However, little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color, and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.669","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of feature advertisements and their impact on sales without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2009","46","5","Caroline Goukens, Siegfried Dewitte, and Luk Warlop","Me, Myself, and My Choices: The Influence of Private Self-Awareness on Choice","This article examines the impact of private self-awareness on consumer decision making.

Store shelf context is a boundary condition, such that the location effects on perceived product heaviness and package evaluation appear in a contrasting context but disappear in an assimilating context.

When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension).

In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics.

This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout.

Second, choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand shares when some of the brands are less popular than others. The authors demonstrate these three benefits of subsets using a mixture of analytical results and numerical simulations and provide implications for the design of choice-based conjoint analyses.

In this approach, known as the NORTA method, the normal distribution function is applied to each coordinate of a vector Z of correlated standard normals to produce a vector U of correlated uniform random variables over (0,1); then X is obtained by applying the inverse of the target marginal distribution function for each coordinate of U. The fitting requires finding the appropriate correlation \u03c1 between any two given coordinates of Z that would yield the target rank or linear correlation r between the corresponding coordinates of X. This root-finding problem is easy to solve when the marginals are continuous but not when they are discrete. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of this root-finding problem for the case of discrete marginals. We prove key properties of r and of its derivative as a function of \u03c1. It turns out that the derivative is easier to evaluate than the function itself. Based on that, we propose and compare alternative methods for finding or approximating the appropriate \u03c1. The case of discrete distributions with unbounded support is covered as well. In our numerical experiments, a derivative-supported method is faster and more accurate than a state-of-the-art, nonderivative-based method. We also characterize the asymptotic convergence rate of the function r (as a function of \u03c1) to the continuous-marginals limiting function, when the discrete marginals converge to continuous distributions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0281","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to statistical modeling without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this paper, we look at how to incorporate parallel machines in a mixed-integer programming model when using commercial optimization software. More specifically, we look at the issue of symmetry. When multiple identical machines are available, many alternative optimal solutions can be created by renumbering the machines. These alternative solutions lead to difficulties in the branch-and-bound algorithm. We propose new constraints to break this symmetry. We tested our approach on the parallel machine lot-sizing problem with setup costs and times, using a network reformulation for this problem. Computational tests indicate that several of the proposed symmetry-breaking constraints substantially improve the solution time, except when used for solving the very easy problems.

The coloring variant used in the second step depends on whether the recovery in the fourth step is direct or indirect: a direct method uses star coloring and an indirect method uses acyclic coloring.

We also present new analytical results on star and acyclic coloring of chordal graphs. The experimental results show that sparsity exploitation via coloring yields enormous savings in runtime and makes the computation of Hessians of very large size feasible.

The efficiency of the delivery plan is measured by both the sum of the weights in the decomposition, known as the total beam-on time, and the number of different binary matrices appearing in it, referred to as the cardinality, the latter being closely related to the setup time of the treatment. In practice, the total beam-on time is usually restricted to its minimum possible value (which is easy to find), and a decomposition that minimizes cardinality (subject to this restriction) is sought. This decomposition problem is known to be NP-hard, and the best available exact solution methods cannot solve, in reasonable time, problems with dimensions large enough to be of use in actual medical applications. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic. To ensure that the heuristic is computationally efficient, we make use of exact bounds that apply to the decomposition and prove that these bounds can be computed efficiently. We demonstrate that the heuristic performs very well numerically against the best previously published heuristic (that of Kalinowski), reducing the average gap between the cardinality of the solution found and the optimal value by 37% on the largest problems tested (for which optimal solutions could be found). Importantly, this new heuristic performs well on those instances that are problematical for Kalinowski's heuristic. A \u201cbest-of\u201d algorithm, combining heuristics, produces a decomposition with cardinality within one of optimal in about 98.7% of instances tested (for which an optimal solution is available). It reduces the cardinality of solutions produced by about 5% on average. On instances for which optimal solutions can be found, it more than halves the optimality gap and finds an optimal solution in about 28% more cases than Kalinowski's heuristic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0288","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical problem related to optimizing cancer treatment delivery and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Substantial literature has been devoted to the link prediction problem either as an implicitly embedded problem in specific applications or as a generic data mining task. This literature has mostly adopted a static graph representation where a snapshot of the network is analyzed to predict hidden or future links. However, this representation is only appropriate to investigate whether a certain link will ever occur and does not apply to many applications for which the prediction of the repeated link occurrences are of primary interest (e.g., communication network surveillance). In this paper, we introduce the time-series link prediction problem, taking into consideration temporal evolutions of link occurrences to predict link occurrence probabilities at a particular time. Using Enron e-mail data and high-energy particle physics literature coauthorship data, we have demonstrated that time-series models of single-link occurrences achieve comparable link prediction performance with commonly used static graph link prediction algorithms. Furthermore, a combination of static graph link prediction algorithms and time-series models produced significantly better predictions over static graph link prediction methods, demonstrating the great potential of integrated methods that exploit both interlink structural dependencies and intralink temporal dependencies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0292","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data mining and link prediction without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

For the last four decades, several techniques of formulating a piecewise linear function have been developed.

Although seminal research in this area was performed in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, more recently it has attracted the attention of optimization theorists because of several noteworthy success stories from operations management. It is on large-scale and complex problems of dynamic optimization, in particular the Markov decision problem (MDP) and its variants, that the power of RL becomes more obvious. It has been known for many years that on large-scale MDPs, the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling render classical dynamic programming (DP) ineffective. The excitement in RL stems from its direct attack on these curses, which allows it to solve problems that were considered intractable via classical DP in the past. The success of RL is due to its strong mathematical roots in the principles of DP, Monte Carlo simulation, function approximation, and AI. Topics treated in some detail in this survey are temporal differences, Q-learning, semi-MDPs, and stochastic games. Several recent advances in RL, e.g., policy gradients and hierarchical RL, are covered along with references. Pointers to numerous examples of applications are provided. This overview is aimed at uncovering the mathematical roots of this science so that readers gain a clear understanding of the core concepts and are able to use them in their own research.

This paper presents a new component-based approach with evolutionary eliminations for a nurse scheduling problem arising at a major UK hospital. The main idea behind this technique is to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e., the allocated shift pattern of each nurse), and then to implement two evolutionary elimination strategies mimicking natural selection and the natural mutation process on these components, respectively, to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated for them to remain there. This demonstration employs an evaluation function that evaluates how well each component contributes toward the final objective. Two elimination steps are then applied: the first elimination removes a number of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the current schedule; the second elimination may also throw out, with a low level of probability, some worthy components. The eliminated components are replenished with new ones using a set of constructive heuristics using local optimality criteria. Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0298","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution for nurse scheduling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Quasi-random points have the special property that the one-dimensional projections and the earlier dimensional projections are extremely well distributed. This property strongly motivates us to reduce the effective dimensions of the problems. This paper deals with multiasset path-dependent options. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to design new methods for dimension reduction and to offer further insight into dimension reduction techniques, and (2) to investigate the practical performance of various dimension reduction strategies in conjunction with different quasi-random points (digital nets and good lattice points). We propose two groups of two-stage procedures for the constructions of correlated multidimensional Brownian motions, which provide a general framework to combine and use different dimension reduction techniques and optimize the use of quasi-random points. We find the inherent weights that characterize the weighted property and the dimension structure of the underlying functions (e.g., the sensitivity indices, the effective dimensions, etc.), and show how each dimension reduction strategy affects them. Numerical experiments on multiasset path-dependent options demonstrate that significant improvements can be achieved by proper use of dimension reduction strategies and quasi-random points. It is also shown that different quasi-random point sets have different behavior with respect to dimension reduction strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0304","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods in mathematical finance without addressing any social issues, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

The problem we study is the simultaneous batching and scheduling of multistage batch processes for which the binary decision variables are batch selection, batch-unit assignment, and batch sequencing on units. We present methods to decompose the original problem into a number of subproblems in a dynamic fashion. First, we discuss the generation of subproblems based on fixing the batch-selection variables. Second, we generate subproblems by fixing the batch-unit assignment variables in a bottlenecking stage. Third, we generate subproblems by fixing the last batch in the sequence on each unit of the bottlenecking stage. Furthermore, the second and third methods can be carried out in various combinations. Alternatively, a problem can be decomposed into a number of promising subproblems using an automatic strong branching scheme.

We present computational results that illustrate the degree to which various sources of parallel overhead affect scalability and discuss why properties of the problem class itself can have a substantial effect on the efficiency of a particular methodology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1090.0347","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical challenges and algorithmic efficiency in parallel programming without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity, resulting in a score of 1."],["2009","21","4","Daria TerekhovDaria Terekhovdterekho@mie.utoronto.caDepartment of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G8, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, J.

Cross-trained workers can be switched between the two rooms depending on demand but are more expensive than specialized ones.

This paper studies the link-biased (LB) encoding, which is a tree representation, and applies metaheuristics using this encoding to the minimum communication spanning tree (MCST) problem. Given the communication requirements of the nodes, the MCST problem seeks a communication spanning tree with minimum total cost. Optimal solutions for MCST problems are similar to minimum spanning trees (MSTs), and the LB encoding exploits this property by encoding trees similar to MSTs with higher probability. The paper investigates how to systematically design problem-specific encodings for MCST problems and how to set the encoding-specific parameter that controls the bias of the LB encoding towards MSTs; it then presents performance results for various MCST problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0310","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of metaheuristics and optimization problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this paper, given \u03f5 > 0, we propose and analyze an algorithm that computes a (1 + \u03f5)-approximate solution to the weighted Euclidean one-center problem. Our algorithm explicitly constructs a small subset \ud835\udcb3 \u2ac5 \ud835\udc9c, called an \u03f5-core set of \ud835\udc9c, for which the optimal solution of the corresponding weighted Euclidean one-center problem is a close approximation to that of \ud835\udc9c. In addition, we establish that \u2223 \ud835\udcb3\u2223 depends only on \u03f5 and on the ratio of the smallest and largest weights, but is independent of the number of points m and the dimension n. This result subsumes and generalizes the previously known core set results for the minimum enclosing ball problem. Our algorithm computes a (1 + \u03f5)-approximate solution to the weighted Euclidean one-center problem for \ud835\udc9c in \ud835\udcaa(mn\u2223\ud835\udcb3\u2223) arithmetic operations. Our computational results indicate that the size of the \u03f5-core set computed by the algorithm is, in general, significantly smaller than the theoretical worst-case estimate, which contributes to the efficiency of the algorithm, especially for large-scale instances. We shed some light on the possible reasons for this discrepancy between the theoretical estimate and the practical performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0315","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm related to computational geometry without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Therefore, when nonstationary arrival processes are required, it is natural to assume Poisson arrivals with a time-varying arrival rate. For many systems, however, this provides an inaccurate representation of the arrival process that is either more or less variable than Poisson. In this paper we extend techniques that transform a stationary Poisson arrival process into a nonstationary Poisson arrival process (NSPP) by transforming a stationary renewal process into a nonstationary, non-Poisson (NSNP) arrival process. We show that the desired arrival rate is achieved and that when the renewal base process is either more or less variable than Poisson, then the NSNP process is also more or less variable, respectively, than an NSPP. We also propose techniques for specifying the renewal base process when presented properties of, or data from, an arrival process and illustrate them by modeling real arrival data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0316","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of simulation models and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, not all lean implementations have produced such results. Apparently, this effect is moderated by several factors, potentially even to the point of reversal. It is important to increase our understanding of how this might occur. In this paper, we explore how novelty, complexity, instability, and buffering affect the relationship between lean implementation and production costs. An interest in these factors drew us to study the case of Lockheed Martin's production system for the F-22, an extremely complex and innovative product. To build theory, we synthesize our empirical data from the case with other existing theory, such as theories of learning and complexity. Through this analysis, we develop a revised framework that reconceptualizes the effect of lean on production costs and use it to develop 11 propositions to direct further research. Included among these are propositions about how the timing, scale, and extent of lean implementation can regulate the benefits of lean. Furthermore, when the objective of lean is construed as the provision of value, we propose that this value is an emergent property of a complex process, different from the mere sum of the values provided by its constituent tasks. Therefore, the elimination of tasks will not guarantee cost reduction, and lean may provide even greater value by incorporating some aspects of agile manufacturing. Overall, we develop a fuller range of the effects of lean practices on production costs and illuminate how operations managers might control key variables to draw greater benefits from lean implementation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.03.009","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of lean production and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Nowadays, quality award models, such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) and the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model, are used as a guide to TQM implementation by a large number of organizations. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of empirical research confirming whether these models clearly reflect the main premises of TQM. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which the EFQM Excellence Model captures the main assumptions involved in the TQM concept, that is, the distinction between technical and social TQM issues, the holistic interpretation of TQM in the firm, and the causal linkage between TQM procedures and organizational performance.\n            \n            Based on responses collected from managers of 446 Spanish companies by means of a structured questionnaire, we find that: (a) social and technical dimensions are embedded in the model; (b) both dimensions are intercorrelated; (c) they jointly enhance results.

The purchase price of materials and components for the new product provides only part of the picture for design and sourcing decisions. All-encompassing analyses of cost and performance, such as total cost of ownership, are extraordinarily difficult to implement because they are demanding in terms of time, data and cooperation. We study monetary quantification of points of difference, which enables an NPD team to base its decisions instead on more focused, strategically-pertinent analyses of costs and performance. We propose a substantive model of its antecedents and consequences. We then test this model with data from matched samples of 144 project leaders and 144 cost analysts who participated in the same NPD projects. Using structural equation modeling, we also test hypothesized differences in perspectives between project leaders and cost analysts. Results demonstrate the pivotal role of monetary quantification of points of difference among the sourcing alternatives being considered, especially for cost analysts. Results also demonstrate that Decision Justification to senior management drives the NPD team's decision-making process. Finally, monetary quantification of points of difference leads to Uncertainty Reduction, which is found to be the primary antecedent of the judged success of applying analysis of cost and performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.07.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of sourcing decisions and profitability in new product development, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, supply chain characteristics that drive dynamic complexity are shown to have a greater impact on performance than those that drive only detail complexity. In addition to providing a definition and empirical test of supply chain complexity, the study serves to link the systems complexity literature to the prescriptions found in the flexibility and lean production literatures.

In China's coastal industrial zones, where most Fortune 500 companies have established their manufacturing bases, local suppliers are facing serious labor turnover problems. High labor turnover rates have caused poor quality, low productivity, and unfilled orders in supply chains. Applying a combination of quantitative techniques to determine the reasons why workers leave China's export factories, this research tries to identify the root causes of job dissatisfaction leading to turnover and provides managerial implications that may assist managers in dealing with labor-related supply chain risks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.09.002","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['labor', 'dissatisfaction', 'turnover', 'supply chain', 'risk']","The article addresses labor issues such as job dissatisfaction and turnover in supply chains, which indicates a concern for worker welfare.

This is not only true because firms are more exposed to catastrophes, but also the result of investments made in recent years to operate supply chains with fewer human and capital resources, especially inventory. Consequently, there is today less \u201cslack\u201d available in supply chains to deal with catastrophic events. Thus, proactively planning for these types of events should be a priority for supply chain managers. A catastrophic event has a very low probability of occurrence but has significant consequences if it does occur. The goal of this research is to develop a process to proactively plan for catastrophic risk events through an integration of diverse research streams related to the management of risk. In particular, the proposed process builds upon an existing risk analysis framework by incorporating an innovative methodology used by the insurance industry to quantify the risk of multiple types of catastrophic events on key supply chain locations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.06.002","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['catastrophic events', 'risk', 'planning']","The article focuses primarily on risk management and operational efficiency in supply chains without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Organizations require agility in their supply chains to provide superior value as well as to manage disruption risks and ensure uninterrupted service to customers. Thus the cultivation of agility is approached as a risk management initiative that enables a firm to respond rapidly to marketplace changes, as well as anticipated and actual disruptions in the supply chain. Agility is of value for both risk mitigation and response.\n            \n            This research investigates the impact of two cultural antecedents, market orientation and learning orientation, and three organizational practices, all aimed at augmenting the supply chain agility of a firm. A firm\u2019s supply chain agility (FSCA) is defined as the capability of the firm, both internally and in conjunction with its key suppliers and customers, to adapt or respond in a speedy manner to marketplace changes as well as to potential and actual disruptions, contributing to the agility of the extended supply chain.\n            \n            The two cultural antecedents of market and learning orientations are posited to affect the organizational practices of internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility, and eventually impact the firm\u2019s supply chain agility. The external flexibility elements considered are volume and mix flexibility. In addition, the specific organizational characteristics and practices exhibited by firms with high levels of supply chain agility are also investigated.\n            \n            Through the use of the structural equation modeling technique, partial least squares (PLS), it is shown that strong linkages exist among the cultural antecedents, the three organizational practices considered, and the firm\u2019s supply chain agility. All three organizational practices, internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility are shown to have significant positive impact on the firm\u2019s supply chain agility.\n            \n            Market orientation is shown to significantly impact both internal and external supply chain integration, along with the two elements of external flexibility. Learning orientation, on the other hand, is shown to have a strong and direct influence only on the level of internal integration. Firms with high levels of external integration are also shown to have high levels of internal integration, consistent with past research. Internal and external integration efforts are also seen to be unrelated to the levels of external flexibility present. The results serve to establish a set of key drivers for augmenting supply chain agility as a risk management initiative.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.09.006","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['agility', 'risk management', 'organizational practices']","The article focuses primarily on supply chain agility and risk management without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113\u2013121], notably operationalized in manufacturing entities like cells and focused factories, has also been adopted by the health care industry. Examples include patient-focused care systems and product/service lines. Despite its longevity, there is a paucity of studies analyzing the focus concept and its link to performance, especially in health care. This research is aimed at enhancing our understanding of how a focus-based approach to organization redesign in health care affects processes and practices, and what operational, clinical, and financial outcomes result from such a change. The research setting is a single case site within a large medical center for which costs for trauma care used to exceed income. Using a structured framework, we document the design and operation of this physically and organizationally integrated Level I trauma care center and compare it to its preceding operation. Its pre- and post-conversion performance is analyzed using symmetric event windows covering three-year periods before and after the focused hospital unit (FHU) was established. Under a sizable increase in workload, we find no change in mortality, moderate improvement in length of stay, and a large improvement in net operating margins. Surprisingly, the latter stem not from reductions in cost but in sharply increased hospital reimbursements. Previous studies of hospital restructuring involving focused patient populations have not conclusively supported a positive link between focus and outcomes. However, this investigation of a specific FHU suggests, conceptually as well as quantitatively, that focus can be an attractive element in health care system design.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.08.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['health care', 'performance', 'organization redesign']","The article primarily focuses on operational and financial outcomes in a healthcare setting without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our analysis shows that firms with more slack in their supply chain experience less negative stock market reaction. The extent of business diversification has no significant effect on the stock market reaction. Firms that are more geographically diversified experience a more negative stock market reaction.

From this foundation, we run a series of behavioral experiments to test our hypotheses that problem solving approaches and information availability impact supply chain performance as presented in the beer distribution game. A key finding of this study is that individuals who take an abstract problem solving approach are able to perform better than individuals who take a concrete problem solving approach in the context of limited information availability.

Our study applied to manufacturer\u2013distributor dyads in China and used matched survey data (225 paired sample firms) to test our hypotheses. Our hierarchical multivariate regression and semipartial correlation analyses suggest that transactional mechanisms are more effective in restraining opportunism while relational mechanisms are more powerful in improving relationship performance. This performance is improved more significantly when both contracts and relational norms are used jointly than when used separately. Likewise, opportunism is curbed more effectively when both contracts and trust are used jointly than when used individually.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.09.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['opportunism', 'relationship performance', 'trust']","The article primarily focuses on transactional and relational mechanisms in buyer-supplier relationships without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

It is difficult for reseachers to reach suppliers who have violated SCC, especially within a large sample, because few disclose SCC violations to the public. In this paper, however, we identified 108 non-compliant Chinese apparel and textile suppliers. Through the investigation of these non-compliant suppliers and their compliant peers, this paper tests the impacts of antecedent factors (price pressure, production complexity, and contract duration) and buyer's governance mechanisms (peer-to-peer and buyer-to-supplier) on the likelihood of a supplier's compliance with SCC. While the buyer-to-supplier governance does not show significant effects, the peer-to-peer governance demonstrates the likelihood of supplier's commitment to SCC. This research reveals that if buyer's governance efforts move away from threat and toward cooperation, supplier's compliance with SCC could be more sustainable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.09.005","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['Supplier Codes of Conduct', 'compliance', 'governance', 'sustainable']","The article discusses Supplier Codes of Conduct (SCC) and the compliance of suppliers, indicating a focus on ethical practices in supply chains.

Our study addresses this research gap. We model firms\u2019 abilities to collectively collaborate with suppliers, customers, and internal employee teams in NPD as collaborative competence and examine its impact on project and market performance. Using responses collected from 189 NPD managers, we find empirical evidence for collaborative competence and its differential impact on project and market performance. Specifically, we find that collaborative competence has a direct impact on project performance, but its impact on market performance is indirect, mediated through project performance. The results have significant managerial implications; achieving superior market performance from inter- and intra-organizational involvement is contingent on achieving superior project performance, and companies that fail to achieve desired project performance outcomes will also fail in achieving market performance goals.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2008.10.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['collaborative', 'interdependence', 'performance']","The article discusses collaborative competence and interdependence, which suggests a focus on teamwork and collective efforts.

The results offer strong empirical evidence that outsourcing performance is significantly influenced by extensive strategic evaluation and proactive relationship management practices. Moreover, the impact strategic evaluation has on outsourcing performance is not direct, but rather is partially mediated by the relationship between the parties.

Building on the resource-based view, knowledge-based view and strategic choice theory, we develop hypotheses linking two knowledge-driven supply chain phenomena (i.e., knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital), innovation\u2013cost strategy, and action to firm-level performance. Using survey and archival data from 489 firms, we found that performance is influenced by how well knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital efforts complement alternative chain strategies. More specifically, each strategy type requires different constellations of knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital to enhance action and create superior firm performance. These results highlight the importance of supply chain phenomena for firm-level performance, and more broadly, the value of supply chains as a competitive weapon in contemporary firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.01.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In our field interviews and observations of high-reputation plant managers from 11 manufacturing plants, we found that effective political skill enabled them to influence subordinates in ways that contributed positively to organizational outcomes. Political skill is an interpersonal style that combines social astuteness with the ability to relate well, and otherwise demonstrate situationally appropriate behavior in an engaging way that inspires confidence, trust, and genuiness [Ferris, G.R., Perrew\u00e9, P.L., Anthony, W.P., Gilmore, D.C., 2000.

We observed that effective plant managers possessed a configuration of dispositional traits (self-motivation, sense of humility, and affability), systematically employed interpersonal behaviors (creating accountability, leading by example, and developing trust), and focused on managerial processes (stretch goals, influencing and learning from below, and empowering direct reports). By juxtaposing the political skill and power literatures, we propose a theory of plant manager effectiveness as a combination of political skill and the use of unobtrusive and systemic power to achieve both affective and substantive outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.01.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['political skill', 'interpersonal', 'trust']","The article discusses political skill and interpersonal behaviors, which may touch on aspects of leadership effectiveness but lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Data on 2012 buying situations were collected from Tier 1 suppliers to three U.S. domestic automotive assemblers (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) and three Japanese transplant automotive assemblers (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota) over three consecutive years (2003\u20132005). The results indicate that (1) buyer-initiated cooperative actions of communication, assistance, and supplier involvement increase a supplier's willingness to invest in technology, (2) the relationship-enhancing effect of buyer assistance increases under high relational stress, while the effectiveness of buyer communication decreases, and (3) that the effect of supplier involvement is not significantly influenced by relational stress levels. Furthermore, we found that supplier relations with Japanese transplant assemblers are characterized by higher levels of cooperative actions, lower levels of relational stress, and higher levels of supplier willingness to invest in technology when compared to those of U.S. domestic assemblers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['cooperative actions', 'relational stress', 'supplier involvement']","The article discusses buyer-supplier relationships and cooperative actions, but it primarily focuses on operational efficiency and technology investment rather than social justice or equity themes.

While there is a general agreement regarding the positive impact of TQM on performance, there has been less agreement among the academics about the impact of ISO 9000/1994. Perhaps in response to such debate, the new ISO 9001/2000 has appeared purporting to be more in line with the TQM philosophy. As of now, how this 2000 version actually affects performance is yet to be explored. In this study, we compare the implementation of ISO 9000/1994 and ISO 9001/2000 as representing two different efforts to implement quality management practices. We evaluate its impact on company performance with a sample of 713 Spanish industrial companies. We also examine if the 2000 version of ISO is taking us closer to the implementation of TQM. Further, we depart from the past studies methodologically by considering performance as a formative construct rather than a reflective construct. Based on the mean and covariance structural (MACS) analyses, we conclude that ISO 9001/2000 certified companies do not perform noticeably better than ISO 9000/1994 or non-certified companies. However, we find that ISO 9001/2000 certified companies apply TQM at a higher level than ISO 9000/1994 certified companies, but whether they actually perform better is less clear.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2009.04.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of quality management systems and their impact on performance, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2009","33.0","1","VenuGopal Balijepally, RadhaKanta Mahapatra, Sridhar Nerur, and Kenneth H.

The Productivity Paradox of Pair Programming","Extreme programming is currently gaining popularity as an alternate software development methodology.  Pair programming, a core practice of this methodology, involves two programmers working collaboratively to develop software.  This study examined the efficacy of pair programming by comparing the performance effectiveness and affective responses of collaborating pairs with those of individual programmers treated as nominal pairs.  In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated:  programming setting (collaborative pair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low).  Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs.  The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair.  Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair.  This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity.  Consequently, there was no evidence of an \u201cassembly bonus effect,\u201d where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone.  While this finding may appear counterintuitive due to the general perception of two heads being better than one, it is consistent with the findings in small group research.  When affective responses were considered, programming pairs reported higher levels of satisfaction than those of the best and second-best performing members in nominal pairs.  They also showed higher levels of confidence in their performance compared to those of the second-best members.  But the confidence levels of pairs were no different from those of the best performing members in nominal pairs.  Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented.","https://misq.umn.edu/are-two-heads-better-than-one-for-software-development-the-productivity-paradox-of-pair-programming.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of pair programming and its effectiveness without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The ability to detect the presence or absence of between-group differences and accurately estimate the strength of moderating effects is important in studies that attempt to show contingent effects.  In the past, IS scholars have used a variety of approaches to examine these effects, with the partial least squares (PLS) pooled significance test for multigroup becoming the most common (e.g., Ahuja and Thatcher 2005; Enns et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2006).  In other areas of social sciences (Epitropaki and Martin 2005) and management (Mayer and Gavin 2005; Song et al. 2005) research, however, there is greater emphasis on the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling multigroup analysis.  This paper compares these two methods through Monte Carlo simulation.  Our findings demonstrate the conditions under which covariance-based multigroup analysis is more appropriate as well as those under which there either is no difference or the component-based approach is preferable.  In particular, we find that when data are normally distributed, with a small sample size and correlated exogenous variables, the component-based approach is more likely to detect differences between-group than is the covariance-based approach.  Both approaches will consistently detect differences under conditions of normality with large sample sizes.  With non-normally distributed data, neither technique could consistently detect differences across the groups in two of the paths, suggesting that both techniques struggle with the prediction of a highly skewed and kurtotic dependent variable.  Both techniques detected the differences in the other paths consistently under conditions of non-normality, with the component-based approach preferable at moderate effect sizes, particularly for smaller samples.","https://misq.umn.edu/assessing-between-group-differences-in-information-systems-research-a-comparison-of-covariance-and-component-based-sem.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['between-group differences', 'multigroup analysis', 'covariance', 'component-based']","The article discusses between-group differences and multigroup analysis, which suggests an awareness of diversity in research contexts.

We articulate that avoidance and adoption are two qualitatively different phenomena and contend that technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, but incomplete, understanding of users\u2019 IT threat avoidance behavior.  Drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory, TTAT delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes, threat appraisal and coping appraisal, to decide how to cope with IT threats.  In the threat appraisal, users will perceive an IT threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious IT and that the negative consequences are severe.  The threat perception leads to coping appraisal, in which users assess the degree to which the IT threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and self-efficacy of taking the safeguarding measure.

An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an online user, having observed others\u2019 actions, to follow the adoption decision of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.  Informational cascades are often rational for individual decision making; however, it may lead to adoption of inferior products.  With easy availability of information about other users\u2019 choices, the Internet offers an ideal environment for informational cascades.  In this paper, we empirically examine informational cascades in the context of online software adoption.  We find user behavior in adopting software products is consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature.  Our results demonstrate that online users\u2019 choices of software products exhibit distinct jumps and drops with changes in download ranking, as predicted by informational cascades theory.  Furthermore, we find that user reviews have no impact on user adoption of the most popular product, while having an increasingly positive impact on the adoption of lower ranking products.  The phenomenon persists after controlling for alternative explanations such as network effects, word-of-mouth effects, and product diffusion.  Our results validate informational cascades as an important driver for decision making on the Internet.  The finding also offers an explanation for the mixed results reported in prior studies with regard to the influence of online user reviews on product sales.  We show that the mixed results could be due to the moderating effect of informational cascades.","https://misq.umn.edu/informational-cascades-and-software-adoption-on-the-internet-an-empirical-investigation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of informational cascades in software adoption without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Dual Model of Post-Adoption Phenomena and its Empirical Test in the Context of Online Services","Sustained website traffic through consumers\u2019 patronage at the post-adoption stages is known as a key to the survival of an online service provider.  Although a firm\u2019s survival depends much on repeated use, whether or not a firm survives is also influenced by a variety of other behavioral outcomes that include, but are not limited to, word-of-mouth, willingness to pay, and inattentiveness to alternatives.  Whereas post-adoption research has recently paid attention to repeated use, the information systems field still lacks a systematic investiation into other behavioral outcomes that transcend mere usage.  In an attempt to extend the horizons of post-adoption research, we develop and test a model that explains post-adoption behaviors in the context of online services.  First, drawing on a dual model of relationship maintenance in consumer behavior research, we propose a conceptual framework to study and explain online consumer behavior.  In particular, our model predicts that two contrasting mechanisms, that is, dedication and constraint, are the main drivers of post-adoption phenomena (i.e., consumers\u2019 post-adoption reactions to online services\u2014beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors).  We empirically test the proposed dual model through the use of data collected from 510 users of online portals.  The results of structural equation modeling analysis indicate that, as expected, the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms simultaneously, yet differentially, determine online consumer behavior.  In general, our findings suggest that it is essential in examining the complex nature of post-adoption phenomena to take into account the interplay of the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms.","https://misq.umn.edu/out-of-dedication-or-constraint-a-dual-model-of-post-adoption-phenomena-and-its-empirical-test-in-the-context-of-online-services.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['consumer behavior', 'post-adoption', 'online services']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and post-adoption phenomena without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, these media can affect negotiators\u2019 behaviors as they engage in what is called concession making, which is a process by which they make offers that yield benefits to their opponents.  In this paper, we focus on how and why conducting negotiations via computer media can affect this process, especially when negotiators have unequal power.  Our research model is based on theories from the information systems, negotiation, and social psychology literatures.  Via a laboratory experiment, we find that concessions made by the first individual to make an offer (the first mover) were not typically reciprocated by his/her negotiating opponent (the second mover).  Thus, in the context of computer-mediated negotiation, it appears that second movers are, among other things, more likely to violate the well-established norm of reciprocity.  This can result in significant disadvantages for the first mover, independent of power differences between negotiators.  In addition, we find that, contrary to face-to-face negotiations, increased power of one negotiator resulted in his/her having less influence in terms of getting larger concessions from the other negotiator.  In general, these findings support the notion that computer-mediated negotiation can be significantly different than face-to-face negotiation.","https://misq.umn.edu/power-and-concession-in-computer-mediated-negotiations-an-examination-of-first-offers.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['power', 'negotiations', 'concessions']","The article discusses power dynamics in negotiations, which touches on themes of inequality, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of negotiation processes rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

Data for the study were collected through a survey of South Korean IT executives.  Results of the study support the fundamental proposition of complementarity between formal contracts and relational governance, and indicate that well-structured SLAs have significant positive influence on the various aspects of relational governance in IT outsourcing relationships.  However, the study also reveals that change characteristics of SLAs may act as a substitute for relational governance as these characteristics were found to dampen the level of trust and commitment through moderation effects.

Information Systems researchers have spent considerable time exploring the impact and implications of these tools in organizations, but those same researchers have not spent sufficient time considering whether and how these new technologies may provide opportunities for us to reform our core practices of research, review, and teaching.  To this end, this paper calls for the IS discipline to engage in two actions related to wikis and other Web 2.0 tools.  First, the IS discipline ought to engage in critical reflection about how wikis and other Web 2.0 tools could allow us to conduct our core processes differently.  Our existing practices were formulated during an era of paper-based exchange; wikis and other Web 2.0 tools may enable processes that could be substantively better.  Nevertheless, users can appropriate information technology tools in unexpected ways, and even when tools are appropriated as expected there can be unintended negative consequences.  Any potential changes to our core processes should, therefore, be considered critically and carefully, leading to our second recommended action.  We advocate and describe a series of controlled experiments that will help assess the impact of these technologies on our core processes and the associated changes that would be necessary to use them.  We argue that these experiments can provide needed information regarding Web 2.0 tools and related practice changes that could help the discipline better assess whether or not new practices would be superior to existing ones and under which circumstances.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-shoemaker-s-children-using-wikis-for-information-systems-teaching-research-and-publication.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['critical reflection', 'Web 2.0', 'core processes']","The article discusses the need for critical reflection on the use of Web 2.0 tools in Information Systems, indicating a moderate focus on ethics and the potential societal impacts of technology.

A parallel research stream emphasizes voluntariness, a key social influence and contextual variable, as a critical factor in information technology (IT) adoption, but pays little attention to its role in TAM.  This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relationships among the four primary TAM constructs. A meta-analysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies. The current study contributes not only to the distinction between user-based and environment-based voluntariness but also to a more complete understanding of user acceptance of IT across system-use environments.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-meta-analysis-of-the-role-of-environment-based-voluntariness-in-information-technology-acceptance.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['voluntariness', 'social influence', 'contextual variable']","The article discusses 'voluntariness' as a social influence in IT adoption, indicating a consideration of social factors in technology acceptance.

However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question:  Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?  To investigate this question, we integrate an individual\u2019s concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system.  We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.  We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.  We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs.  We find that an individual\u2019s CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs.  In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.  An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.  These results as well as other theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","https://misq.umn.edu/adoption-of-electronic-health-records-in-the-presence-of-privacy-concerns-the-elaboration-of-likelihood-model-and-individual-persuasion.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'concerns', 'attitudes', 'information privacy']","The article addresses significant privacy concerns related to the adoption of electronic health records, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in technology use.

Competing with free is particularly concerning for movie studios, whose content may be more prone to single-use consumption than other industries such as music.  This issue has gained renewed importance recently with the advent of new digital video recording and distribution technologies, and the widespread availability of Internet piracy.\n\nWe examine competition between \u201cfree\u201d and paid video content in two important contexts:  the impact of legitimate free distribution in one channel on sales through paid channels, and the impact of illegitimate free distribution in pirated channels on sales through paid channels.  We do this by studying the impact of movie broadcasts on DVD demand and the impact of piracy availability at the time of broadcast on DVD demand.  Our data include all movies shown on over-the-air and cable television during an eight-month period in 2005\u20132006.\n\nWith respect to the impact of movie broadcasts on piracy and sales, we find that movie broadcasts on over-the-air networks result in a significant increase in both DVD sales at Amazon. com and illegal downloads for those movies that are available on BitTorrent at the time of broadcast.  With respect to the impact of piracy on sales, we use the television broadcast as an exogenous demand shock and find that the availability of pirated content at the time of broadcast has no effect on post-broadcast DVD sales gains. \n\nTogether our results suggest that creative artists can use product differentiation and market segmentation strategies to compete with freely available copies of their content.  Specifically, the post-broadcast increase in DVD sales suggests that giving away content in one channel can stimulate sales in a paid channel if the free content is sufficiently differentiated from its paid counterpart.  Likewise, our finding that the presence of pirated content does not cannibalize sales for the movies in our sample suggests that if free and paid products appeal to separate customer segments, the presence of free products need not harm paid sales.","https://misq.umn.edu/competing-with-free-the-impact-of-movie-broadcasts-on-dvd-sales-and-internet-piracy.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['piracy', 'content', 'sales']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of piracy and content distribution without addressing social justice or ethical concerns.

Three types of decision aids with different decision strategy support capabilities (an additive-compensatory based aid, an elimination-based aid, and a hybrid aid supporting both strategies) are compared in terms of users\u2019 perceptions of strategy restrictiveness, advice quality, and cognitive effort.  These comparisons are grounded on the properties of normativeness and complementarity of decision strategies employed by the aids.  A normative strategy takes into account both the users\u2019 attribute preferences and the relative importance of such preferences, and allows for trade-offs among preferences (e.g., additive\u2013compensatory).  Strategy complementarity indicates support for decision rules based on multiple strategies (e.g., both additive\u2013compensatory and elimination strategies).\n\nThe experimental results support the validity of the extended effort\u2013accuracy\u2013restrictiveness framework and the effects of strategy normativeness, but not the effects of strategy complementarity.

Recent theoretical models of trading and sorting in used-good markets provide testable predictions to use to examine the presence of adverse selection and trade patterns in such dynamic markets.  A key aspect of such empirical analyses is to distinguish between product-level uncertainty and seller-level uncertainty, an aspect the extant literature has largely ignored.  Based on a unique, 5-month panel data set of user-generated content on used good quality and seller reputation feedback collected from Amazon, this paper examines trade patterns in online used-good markets across four product categories (PDAs, digital cameras, audio players, and laptops).  Drawing on two different empirical tests and using content analysis to mine the textual feedback of seller reputations, the paper provides evidence that adverse selection continues to exist in online markets.  First, it is shown that after controlling for price and other product, and for seller-related  factors, higher quality goods take a longer time to sell compared to lower quality goods.  Second, this result also holds when the relationship between sellers\u2019 reputation scores and time to sell is examined.  Third, it is shown that price declines are larger for more unreliable products, and that products with higher levels of intrinsic unreliability exhibit a more negative relationship between price decline and volume of used good trade.  Together, our findings suggest that despite the presence of signaling mechanisms such as reputation feedback and product condition disclosures, the information asymmetry problem between buyers and sellers persists in online markets due to both product-based and seller-based information uncertainty.  No consistent evidence of substitution or complementarity effects between product-based and seller-level uncertainty are found.

We argue that an individual\u2019s embeddedness in the social network of the organizational unit implementing a new information system can enhance our understanding of technology use.  An individual\u2019s coworkers can be important sources of help in overcoming knowledge barriers constraining use of a complex system, and such interactions with others can determine an employee\u2019s ability to influence eventual system configuration and features.

In particular, missing in the explanation of user decision making is the concept of status quo bias, that is, that user resistance can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation.  Motivated thus, this study develops a model to explain user resistance prior to a new IS implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective.  The results of testing the model in the context of a new enterprise system implementation indicate the central role of switching costs in increasing user resistance.  Further, switching costs also mediate the relationship between other antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change) and user resistance.

Consequently, the role of relational factors in driving project success has been overlooked in this literature.  In this paper, we address this gap by integrating the social embeddedness perspective and the culture literature to theorize how and why relational factors affect the success of offshore IS projects that are strategic in nature.  We identify organizational and interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this context.  Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of offshore IS project success\u2014namely, project cost overruns and client satisfaction\u2014over and above the effects of project characteristics and agency factors.  Specifically, we found that information exchange, joint problem solving, and trust reduce project cost overruns and improve client satisfaction.  We also found a relationship between cultural differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS project success.  The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively, for projects with a client representative.  For projects with no client representative, the model explained 35 percent and 37 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively.

As worldwide competition exerts increasing pressure on the IS function of firms to become geographically unbundled, and IS services are dispersed among increasingly distant and unfamiliar locations, the issue of risk emerges as a significant factor in decisions about where to locate offshore facilities.  Drawing from prior research in IS outsourcing/offshoring and theoretical perspectives from international strategy and multinational management, we examine the determinants of risk firms bear in their offshoring decisions.  In particular, the current paper explores firm-level and environment-level \u201cpush\u201d factors that drive firms to accept increasingly greater degrees of host country risk.  We predict that firm-level risk outcomes for locating IS offshore facilities will be influenced by prior firm-specific experience, the relative gap between home and host country risk levels, and the overall movement by IS offshore services providers toward increasingly riskier locations. We test these hypotheses on a proprietary data set of more than 850 information technology and software offshoring projects in 55 host countries worldwide during the period 2000 through 2005.  We find that firm-specific experience and the core \u201crisk gap\u201d between home and host country are predictive of companies pursuing progressively riskier locations, but that their effects dissipate as environment-wide experience is incorporated into our model.  Our analysis suggests that broader dynamics in the competitive environment are powerful contributors to the overall observation that IS offshoring is moving to increasingly high-risk locations.  This trend has implications for the management, security, and global integration of information systems.  Our study contributes to the literature on risk and IS offshoring in providing the first worldwide empirical examination of the determinants of actual firm IS offshoring behavior with respect to offshoring location risk.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-evolution-of-risk-in-information-systems-offshoring-the-impact-of-home-country-risk-firm-learning-and-competitive-dynamics.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['risk', 'offshoring', 'globalization']","The article primarily focuses on the technical and strategic aspects of risk in information systems offshoring without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Although IFTU sheds light on the four mechanisms underlying technology use, it lacks a coherent theoretical explanation for the underlying force that leads to the four mechanisms.  To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology.  In addition, based on the extended IFTU paradigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena.  Three different sets of data (n = 195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model.  The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior.  Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects.  Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study.  This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the extended IFTU paradigm has the potential to serve as a coherent theoretical framework on post-adoption phenomena in which prior experiences are internalized into memories, which in turn regulate later experiences.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-integrative-framework-of-technology-use-an-extension-and-test.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for understanding technology use without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this essay, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of IS research on continuing IT use.  Although the IS literature on continuing IT use emphasizes the role of habitual behavior that does not require conscious behavioral intention, it does so in a way that largely remains faithful to the theoretical tradition of planned behavior and reasoned action.  However, a close reading of reference literatures on automatic behavior (behavior that is not consciously controlled) and the influences of emotion on behavior suggests that planned behavior and reasoned action may not provide the best theoretical foundation for the study of continuing IT use.  As a result, we call for empirical research that directly compares and contrasts the consensus theory of continuing IT use with rival theories that place much greater emphasis on unplanned and unreasoned action.","https://misq.umn.edu/why-break-the-habit-of-a-lifetime-rethinking-the-roles-of-intention-habit-and-emotion-in-continuing-information-technology-use.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['emotion', 'behavior', 'theoretical']","The article primarily focuses on theoretical frameworks related to information technology usage without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Community learning takes place as its members reflect upon their learning and contribute their experiences, observations, and insights to the community\u2019s on-going discourse on the innovation.  Community learning and organizational learning thus build upon one another in a reciprocal cycle over time, as the stock of interpretations, adoption rationales, implementation strategies, and utilization patterns is expanded and refined.  We advance an overall model of this learning cycle, drawing on two community-level theories (management fashion and organizing vision), both of which complement the dominant emphases of the literature on IT innovation and learning.  Relative to this cycle, we then empirically examine, in particular, the dependence of community learning on organizational learning.  Sampling the public discourse on enterprise resource planning (ERP) over a 14-year period, we explore how different kinds of organizational actors can play different roles, at different times, in contributing different types of knowledge to an innovation\u2019s public discourse.  The evidence suggests that research analysts and technology vendors took leadership early on in articulating the \u201cknow-what\u201d (interpretation) and \u201cknow-why\u201d (rationales) for ERP, while later on adopters came to dominate the discourse as its focus shifted to the \u201cknow-how\u201d (strategies and capabilities).

Specifically, each party gains financially from improved management of assets, reduced costs of operations, and enhanced productivity.  Moreover, each benefits operationally from improved planning, control, and flexibility of resources.  Buyer dependence on the supplier increases buyer strategic information flows to the supplier.

Difference scores are commonly used to measure a match between variables or states in IS research, but these have implicit assumptions about the theory and data characteristics that are often false.  Not unexpectedly, false assumptions can lead to erroneous conclusions about the relationships among the variables that are used to determine a match in a research model.  The implicit assumptions restrict the form of the relationships and limit the IS researcher\u2019s ability to understand the possible interplay among theoretical concepts.  We suggest some guidelines for the formation and testing of models that measure the match.

Surprisingly, when sellers offer to consumers a choice between two different-sized packages, their profits are, at most, as high as when such a choice is unavailable. Moreover, when utilizing nonlinear pricing rules is not feasible, the profits of the sellers actually decline when they offer consumers a choice between different-sized packages. A limited empirical investigation supports the comparative statics we derive in our theoretical model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0381","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this study, we examine 29 radical innovations from initial concept to mass-market commercialization. We find that these innovations were developed over an average of at least 50 years and divide this long development period into four distinct stages\u2014conceptualization, gestation, early incubation, and late incubation. We find that the duration of a stage is longer when different firms lead product development at the beginning and end of the stage. These changes in product development leaders happen frequently, e.g., 76% of firms that were first to commercialize an innovation failed to launch it in the broader market. We also find that the time-to-takeoff for a product category is significantly related to the duration of the preceding late incubation stage. In addition, we find four different ways in which radical innovations borrow from prior seemingly unrelated innovations. We report many other findings on when (duration times), by whom (product development leaders), and how (technology borrowing) radical innovations are developed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0384","","MKS","Marketing","2","['innovation', 'development', 'commercialization']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of innovation development and commercialization without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of such \u201ccombative\u201d advertising on market power. We show that, depending on the nature of consumer response, combative advertising can reduce price competition to benefit competing firms. However, it can also lead to a procompetitive outcome where individual firms advertise to increase their own profitability, but collectively become worse off. This is because combative advertising can intensify price competition such that an \u201cadvertising war\u201d leads to a \u201cprice war.\u201d Similar to price competition, advertising competition can result in a prisoner's dilemma where all competing firms make less profit even when the effect of each firm's advertising is to enhance consumer preferences in its favor. Given such procompetitive effects, we further show that cost of combative advertising could be a blessing in disguise\u2014higher unit cost of advertising resulting in lower equilibrium levels of advertising, leading to higher prices and profits. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how combative advertising by competing brands influences consumer preferences.

Data from choice experiments are needed to estimate the mean vector and the variances of the multivariate heterogeneity distribution involved. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to construct semi-Bayesian D-optimal mixed logit designs that take into account the uncertainty about the mean vector of the distribution. These designs are compared to locally D-optimal mixed logit designs, Bayesian and locally D-optimal designs for the multinomial logit model and to nearly orthogonal designs (Sawtooth (CBC)) for a wide range of parameter values. It is found that the semi-Bayesian mixed logit designs outperform the competing designs not only in terms of estimation efficiency but also in terms of prediction accuracy. In particular, it is shown that assuming large prior values for the variance parameters for constructing semi-Bayesian mixed logit designs is most robust against the misspecification of the prior mean vector. In addition, the semi-Bayesian mixed logit designs are compared to the fully Bayesian mixed logit designs, which take also into account the uncertainty about the variances in the heterogeneity distribution and which can be constructed only using prohibitively large computing power. The differences in estimation and prediction accuracy turn out to be rather small in most cases, which indicates that the semi-Bayesian approach is currently the most appropriate one if one needs to estimate mixed logit models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0386","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of modeling consumer preferences without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

One is a quantity competition model, and the other is a price competition model with product differentiation. The key factor is the existence of two heterogeneous consumer groups: those who demand only high-end (name-brand) products and those who care little whether products are high or low end. We show that, under certain conditions, the profits of firms in the high-end market are larger when there are firms producing low-end products than when there are not. The existence of price-sensitive consumers who care little about product quality intensifies competition among the high-end firms. The existence of low-end firms functions as a credible threat, which induces the high-end firms not to overproduce because price-sensitive consumers buy products from the low-end firms. The result provides a new theoretical mechanism concerning the profitability and pricing of national brand firms after the entry of private labels. It has an implication for pricing and marketing strategies: Established firms should not decrease their prices after the entry of nonestablished firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0388","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competition and profitability between high-end and low-end firms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition, the results related to endogeneity and feedback effects from the stock market are also interesting, supporting the idea that historical underperformance in stock prices may breed more harmful future buzz in a \u201cvicious\u201d cycle of NWOM. After controlling for competition, NWOM's long-term financial harm becomes more destructive in magnitude, kicks in more quickly, and haunts investors longer.

They face rivalry for the sale of content to consumers, and at the same time, they compete for advertisers seeking access to the attention of these consumers. We explore the implications of such two-sided competition on the actions and source of profits of media firms. One main conclusion we reach is that media firms may charge higher content prices in a duopoly than in a monopoly. This happens because competition for advertisers can reduce the return per customer impression from the ad market, making each firm less willing to underprice content to increase demand. Greater competitive intensity may thus increase content profits and decrease ad profits. These findings are in sharp contrast to those in a regular one-sided product market, in which competition typically lowers product prices and profits. We extend the framework to examine competition across different media (e.g., between magazines and cable TV) and show that firms in a duopolistic medium may benefit from more intense competition from a monopolist in another medium. We characterize the conditions for each firm in the duopoly medium to bundle more ads and earn greater total profits than the rival firm in the monopoly medium.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0390","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the competitive dynamics between media firms and their pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper we show that consumers' present-biased preferences can generate slippage, and we explore whether this can explain firms' use of mail-in rebates. We assume that the consumer population comprises members who have various degrees of present bias. The model demonstrates that if consumers have homogeneous willingness to pay for a product (and thus rebates do not serve as a mechanism for traditional price discrimination) rebates may still profitably exploit slippage, but to do so they must generate very high slippage rates. This is, because the rebate must greatly exceed the price markup because the rebate must compensate consumers for the cost of redemption and the delay in receiving the rebate. The ability of rebate programs to take advantage of present-biased consumers is quite limited in settings where there is significant variance in the degree of present bias within the population unless the extent of consumers' present bias is highly correlated with their rebate redemption costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0391","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

(ii) What is the optimal strategy for the bidders? (iii) When the objects are asymmetrically valued (e.g., Super Bowl ticket versus souvenir), what is the optimal auctioning sequence under the pure components strategy? Our results suggest that separate auctions of the two objects are superior to the auction of the bundle for most substitutes and even moderate complements when there are at least four bidders. The auction of the pure bundle is better suited for strong complements or with too few bidders. When the combinatorial auction is an available option, it weakly dominates the auction of the pure bundle but has domains of inferiority relative to the separate auctions.

By analyzing the high volatility of daily data, we show how changes in sales patterns can self-emerge as a direct consequence of the stochastic nature of the process. Our contention is that the fluctuations observed in more granular data are not noise, but rather consist of accurate measurement and contain valuable information. By stepping into the noise-like data and treating it as information, we generated better short-term predictions even at very early stages of the penetration process. Using a Kalman-Filter-based tracker, we demonstrate how movements can be traced and how predictions can be significantly improved.

In this paper, we investigate the competitive incentives for such assortment decisions and the implications for manufacturers' distribution strategies. Our results show that if one retailer has the channel power to determine its assortment first, then it can strategically reduce its assortment by carrying only the popular variety while simultaneously inducing the rival retailer to carry both the specialty and popular varieties. The rival retailer then bears higher assortment costs, which leads to relaxed price competition for the commonly carried popular variety. We also show that when the manufacturer has relative channel power, it chooses alternatively to distribute both product varieties through both retailers. Our analysis suggests, therefore, that when a retailer becomes dominant in the distribution channel, it facilitates retail segmentation into discount shops, carrying limited product lines, and specialty shops carrying wider assortments. We also illustrate how retailer power leading to strategic assortment reduction can lead to lower consumer surplus.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0399","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive strategies and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, little is known about the conditions under which a brand should introduce an LE product or the competitive implications of doing so. We investigate this issue using a game theoretic model of a market where two brands compete for consumers who desire exclusivity. Our analysis shows that adding an LE product has a positive direct effect on brand profits through the increased willingness of consumers to pay for such a product, but also has a negative strategic effect by increasing price competition between brands. These effects result in different conclusions depending on the nature of brand differentiation. When brands differ in quality, we show that only the high-quality brand may gain in comparison to a scenario where there are no LE products. Although a low-quality brand may offer an LE product as a defensive strategy, its profits are lower than would be in a world without LE products because of the negative strategic effect. When we consider brands that are differentiated on a horizontal attribute such as taste, we find that the negative strategic effects cause lower equilibrium profits if both brands introduce LE products. Yet brands cannot avoid introducing LE products because they face a prisoners' dilemma.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0401","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the competitive implications of limited edition products and their impact on brand profits without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our approach augments market-level time-series data with widely available summaries of household purchase behavior, i.e., brand penetration and purchase set size data. We show that this augmentation is helpful in the estimation of consumer heterogeneity. For instance, observing a brand with relatively large shares and low penetration typically indicates that preferences are dispersed, with relatively few customers liking the brand a lot. Whereas the combination of share and penetration is informative about heterogeneity with realistic sample sizes, in isolation neither variable may lead to precise estimates of heterogeneity. In addition, other widely available data, e.g., category penetration, is helpful in estimating the size of the total market. Using a large Monte Carlo study, the paper demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach in estimating model parameters, price elasticities, and brand switching. Empirically, the approach is used to evaluate the launch of a new national brand, DiGiorno, in the frozen pizza category.

The firms face market uncertainty about consumers' preferences for innovation on two product attributes and technology uncertainty about the success of their research and development (R&D) investments. Firms can conduct costly market research before setting R&D strategy. We find that the value of market information to a firm depends on whether its rival is expected to obtain this information in equilibrium. Consequently, one firm may forgo market research even though its rival conducts such research and learns the true state of demand. We examine both vertical and horizontal demand structures. With vertical preferences, firms are a priori uncertain about which attribute all consumers will value more. In this case, a firm that conducts market research always attempts innovation on the attribute it discovers that consumers prefer and expends more on R&D than a rival that has not conducted market research. With horizontal preferences, distinct segments exist\u2014each caring about innovation on only one attribute\u2014and firms are a priori uncertain how many consumers each segment contains. In this case, a firm that conducts market research may follow a niche strategy and attempt innovation to serve the smaller segment to avoid intense price competition for the larger segment. A firm that conducts market research may therefore invest less in R&D and earn lower postlaunch profits than a rival that has forgone such research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0409","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market research and innovation strategy within a duopoly context, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We then decompose the length of each observed path into three components: the length of the TSP-path, the additional distance because of order deviation (i.e., not following the TSP-order of category purchases), and the additional distance because of travel deviation (i.e., not following the shortest point-to-point route). We explore the relationship between these deviations and different aspects of in-store shopping/purchase behavior. Among other things, our results suggest that (1) a large proportion of trip length is because of travel deviation; (2) paths that deviate substantially from the TSP solution are associated with larger shopping baskets; (3) order deviation is strongly associated with purchase behavior, while travel deviation is not; and (4) shoppers with paths closer to the TSP solution tend to buy more from frequently purchased product categories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0402","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of grocery shopping paths using the traveling salesman problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Two effects of information acquisition are identified\u2014the efficiency effect that improves retail pricing decision making in an uncertain environment, and the strategic effect whereby the retailer voluntarily discloses the acquired private information to influence the upstream manufacturer's wholesale pricing behavior. It is shown that the efficiency effect benefits the retailer without affecting the manufacturer, while the strategic effect works to the detriment of the retailer but to the advantage of the manufacturer. Nevertheless, unobservable information acquisition can mitigate the retailer's loss and the manufacturer's benefit from the strategic effect of information disclosure. Moreover, an increasing expected information acquisition cost may benefit the retailer, when that cost is low and information acquisition is unobservable to the manufacturer. The implications of this paper can shed light on how firms interact in a channel where the downstream market is data intensive, but information gleaning is costly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0408","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information acquisition and its effects on retail pricing decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Firms' allocation decisions for these marketing communication expenditures have two dimensions\u2014across consumers and over time. This allocation problem is different relative to the problem of allocation of resources for existing products. In the case of new products, consumers are uncertain about their quality and learn about the products through marketing communication. Furthermore, different consumers may have different rates of learning about product quality; i.e., there may be heterogeneous learning. Thus, consumer responsiveness to marketing communication could vary along two dimensions. For each consumer, this responsiveness would vary over time, as she learns about product quality. Across consumers, there would be differences in responsiveness in each time period. For optimal allocation of marketing communication across both consumers and time, firms would need estimates of how consumer responsiveness varies across consumers and over time. Past studies have typically focused on one of these two dimensions in which responsiveness varies. They have either looked at heterogeneity in responsiveness across agents or the variation in responsiveness over time. In the context of new products, past research has looked at how consumer learning about product quality causes responsiveness to vary over time. In this study, we build a model that allows for heterogeneous learning rates and obtain individual-level learning parameters for each consumer. We use a novel and rich panel data set that allows us to estimate these model parameters.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0410","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'marketing communication', 'learning']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of marketing communication and consumer learning without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Assuming that information asymmetry exists between the producer and investors, we investigate how the Internet funding size varies with the word-of-mouth effect, the monitoring effect of the institutional investor, and the bargaining power of the producer over investors. When the producer has no bargaining power, the Internet funding size is determined by balancing the word-of-mouth effect with the monitoring effect by the institutional investment. If there is no word-of-mouth effect, there may be no Internet funding, because netizen investors interpret Internet funding as an indicator of a negative profit. When the producer has high bargaining power, full Internet funding is possible if the information asymmetry of the film quality is resolved.

We characterize each customer by her intrinsic preference towards each firm, the contribution margin she generates for each firm, and her responsiveness to each firm's retention and acquisition efforts. We show that a firm should invest most heavily in retaining those customers that exhibit moderate responsiveness to its CRM efforts. Further, a firm should most aggressively seek to attract those customers that exhibit moderate responsiveness to their provider's CRM efforts and those that are moderately profitable for their current provider. Investing more in customers that are more responsive does not always lead to higher firm profits, because stronger competition for such customers tends to erode the effects of higher CRM efforts of an individual firm. When firms develop a customer relationship over time to generate higher contribution margin or customer responsiveness, we show that such developments may not always be desirable, because sometimes these future benefits may lead to more intense competition and hence lower profits for both firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0424","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on customer relationship management strategies and competitive analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, our variety-seeking model implies tacit collusion between firms in both periods, unlike the inertia model of Klemperer that implies tacit collusion between firms only in the second period but implies fierce price competition in the first period. When consumers are assumed to have rational expectations about future prices, the implied first-period prices increase further, which is consistent with what Klemperer finds in an inertial market. To summarize, while our variety-seeking analyses support two key results (pertaining to second-period prices and rational expectations) previously derived for inertial markets by Klemperer, they depart from one key result (pertaining to first-period prices).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0434","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on price competition and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Two issues are discussed: First, are wine sales influenced by wine journalists' reviews? Second, do experts agree on what makes a good wine buy? The results show that wine sales are indeed significantly influenced by the judgements of wine critics; a 10% rise in newspapers' scores in Norway was accompanied by an average increase of 16%\u201318% in sales figures for table wines. The effect of wine reviews varied somewhat from newspaper to newspaper. It proved difficult to establish criteria for a good wine buy that are objective and independent of the person making the judgement. The journalists gave no unanimous recommendation of good wine buys to the consumers; the same wine could get good reviews in some papers and might well receive run-of-the-mill reviews in others. However, a majority of the reviewers seemed to agree in the ranking of most of the wines, even if the absolute value of the scores differed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0489","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on the influence of wine journalism on sales and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Building on the literature on internal market structure, we estimate a joint store and brand choice model where the loading matrix of brand attributes are allowed to be retail format specific. The approach allows us to recover brand maps for different retail formats while controlling for the short-term marketing mix activities at these stores and the self-selection of households that frequent a particular format. The model is applied to consumer panel data from two product categories, where households are observed to make purchases across three store types: high-end grocery store, traditional supermarket, and large everyday low pricing (EDLP) formats. Our results show strong correlations between the marketing mix sensitivities, store format preference, and unobserved brand attributes. These correlations translate into significant differences in market structure across retail formats and in the direction and size of preference vectors for unobservable brand attributes. We find a tight clustering of brands at the EDLP format, whereas brands are found to compete in distinct subgroups at other stores. Results show that failure to account for retail format effects can substantially bias the understanding of underlying market structure and could lead to incorrect implications in applications such as new product entry.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0432","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market structure and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our discipline has also started to systematically catalogue our measurement knowledge in influential handbooks of marketing scales. However, at least two important issues remain. First, existing scales are often too long for administration in nonstudent samples or in applied studies. Second, existing (U.S.-developed) scales may contain items that are not informative about the underlying construct in particular countries, whereas relevant items tapping into local cultural expressions of the construct in question may be missing. To address these issues, we propose a new model that yields country-specific yet fully cross-nationally comparable short forms of unidimensional marketing scales. The procedure is based on hierarchical item response theory and optimal test design. The procedure is flexible in the sense that the researcher can specify various constraints on item content, scale length, and measurement precision. Because our procedure allows inclusion of country-specific (or \u201cemic\u201d) items in standardized (or \u201cetic\u201d) scales, it presents an important step toward resolving the emic-etic dilemma that has plagued international marketing research for decades.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0439","","MKS","Marketing","4","['country-specific', 'cultural expressions', 'internationally comparable']","The article addresses the need for culturally relevant marketing scales, indicating an awareness of diversity and the importance of local cultural expressions in marketing.

To tackle this problem, we collect data from two sources: (1) we implement a large-scale field test in which a national firm created word of mouth through two populations: customers and noncustomers, and (2) we collect data from an online experiment. We break our theoretical problem into two subproblems. First, we ask: \u201cWhat kind of WOM drives sales?\u201d Motivated by previous research, we hypothesize that for a product with a low initial awareness level, WOM that is most effective at driving sales is created by less loyal (not highly loyal) customers and occurs between acquaintances (not friends). We find support for this in the field test as well as in an experimental setting. Hence, we demonstrate the potential usefulness of exogenously created WOM: conversations are created where none would naturally have occured otherwise. Then, we ask: \u201cWhich agents are most effective at creating this kind of WOM?\u201d In particular, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of the commonly used opinion leader designation. We find that although opinion leadership is useful in identifying potentially effective spreaders of WOM among very loyal customers, it is less useful for the sample of less loyal customers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0444","","MKS","Marketing","2","['communication', 'sales', 'customers']","The article focuses primarily on the mechanics of word-of-mouth communication and its impact on sales without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

How has the price elasticity changed over time? Can P&G increase the price of its brands to gain value growth? (2) What are the price, distribution, and sizing combinations needed to achieve the desirable value growth? (3) How can P&G gain market share from its competitors without cannibalizing its own brands? P&G Asia-Pacific approached us to develop a value growth framework to answer these questions. To generate the answers for the above questions, we develop a three-step weighted random coefficient estimator that captures the heterogeneity across cross sections (different stock-keeping units and states) and the endogeneity of distribution. Based on the parameter estimates, we provide strategic recommendations to P&G for a field test to validate our suggestions. We developed a simulator for P&G managers so that they can generate appropriate marketing-mix strategies for achieving the desired value growth.

We find that the equilibrium outcome depends on the cost efficiencies of the production technologies as well as the consumer sensitivity to product fit and lead time. We develop an index that signifies the relative attractiveness of the standardization and customization strategies, and the potential outcomes. We identify the strategic roles of product variety and lead time in the competition.

This raises the question of how a partial refund policy may work and whether it is even sustainable in a competitive environment. This study investigates how competition may influence the profitability and the equilibrium choice of refund policies. It is shown that partial refunds may endogenously change the nature of strategic interaction between service providers from local monopolies into a competition regime, which moderates the gains from exploiting the efficiency-enhancing effect of partial refunds. A whole range of pure-strategy equilibria can be obtained as a result of the interplay between the efficiency-improving and the competition-intensifying effects. When the capacity is small (large) such that the efficiency-improving (the competition-intensifying) effect is dominant, both firms in equilibrium follow identical partial (zero) refund policies. Moreover, interestingly, the symmetric firms may end up in an asymmetric equilibrium in which one firm follows a partial refund policy and the other adopts a zero refund policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0457","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the profitability and strategic implications of refund policies in competitive markets without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

In contrast to much of the literature, we specifically consider the possibility that if the manufacturer sells her product, then the dealers can either sell or lease it to the final consumer. One of our more interesting findings is that, when the level of competition among dealers is high, the manufacturer prefers to use a lease-brokering arrangement in which the dealers earn a margin for brokering leases between the manufacturer and end consumers, instead of selling her product to the dealers.

A Bayesian, finite-mixture, structural equation model is developed that identifies latent logo clusters while accounting for heterogeneity in evaluations. The concomitant variable approach allows cluster probabilities to be country specific. Rather than a priori defined clusters, our procedure provides a posteriori cross-national logo clusters based on consumer response similarity. Our model reduces the 10 countries to three cross-national clusters that respond differently to logo design dimensions: the West, Asia, and Russia. The dimensions underlying design are found to be similar across countries, suggesting that elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony are universal design dimensions. Responses (affect, shared meaning, subjective familiarity, and true and false recognition) to logo design dimensions (elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony) and elements (repetition, proportion, and parallelism) are also relatively consistent, although we find minor differences across clusters.

Trying to build realistic theories differs dramatically from having correct explanatory theories tested on objective criteria, e.g., verifiable prediction. Evaluating theories on whether assumptions are realistic is potentially subjective, biased, and arbitrary. A theory's domain determines whether its assumptions are sufficiently realistic and when assumptions must hold and to what degree, so testing assumptions in isolation puts an unnecessary burden on the assumptions (i.e., they must hold everywhere). For theories explaining cooperation and information exchange, predictions reveal that the prisoner's dilemma assumptions (only two prisoners, four possible outcomes, two possible actions, etc.) are sufficiently realistic. For theories explaining prisoner sentencing guidelines and probation policy, predictions might suggest otherwise. Scientific methods allow the evaluation of theories on criteria such predictive accuracy, reliability, validity, and robustness\u2014not based on realism. When multiple explanatory theories survive initial testing, one derives conflicting predictions. For example, a theory that people are broccoli produces correct predictions (people are mortal) and incorrect predictions (people are biennial). Tragic consequences can occur when theory adoption depends on whether assumptions are disliked, unpopular, or exclude a favorite variable.

Theory has shown that this could yield a profitable price discrimination strategy often termed \u201cmetering.\u201d The idea is that a customer's intensity of demand for aftermarket goods (e.g., the concessions) provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to pay for the primary good (e.g., admission). If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price (admissions plus concessions) from higher-type customers. This paper develops a simple aggregate model of discrete-continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data. Model simulations illustrate that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below, or equal to their marginal cost. We then apply the approach to box office and concession data from a chain of Spanish theaters and find that high-priced concessions do extract more surplus from customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0494","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we investigate the financial benefits of and computational challenges involved in one-to-one marketing. The analysis uses data from an online grocery and drug retailer. Like many retailers, this firm uses multiple promotional instruments including discount coupons, free shipping offers, and a loyalty program. We investigate the impact of customizing these promotions on the two most important consumer decisions: the decision to buy from the store and expenditure. Our modeling approach accounts for two sources of heterogeneity in consumers' responsiveness to various marketing mix elements: cross-sectional differences across consumers and temporal differences within consumers based on the purchase cycle. The model parameter estimates are fed into a dynamic programming model that determines the optimal number, sequence, and timing of promotions to maximize retailer profits. A series of policy simulations show that customizing promotions leads to a significant increase in profits relative to the firm's current practice of uniform promotions. However, the effectiveness of various promotions varies because of both cross-sectional differences in consumers as well within consumer heterogeneity due to purchase cycle factors. For instance, we find that free shipping tends to be the preferred instrument for re-acquiring lapsed customers, whereas an across-the-board price cut (via a discount coupon) is the most effective tool for managing the segment of most active customers. Interestingly, we find that customizing based on within-customer temporal heterogeneity contributes more to profitability than exploiting variations across consumers. This is important because the computational burden of implementing the dynamic optimization to account for cross-sectional heterogeneity is far greater than accounting for temporal heterogeneity. Furthermore, targeting promotions based only on timing rather than the nature and magnitude of the offers across consumers alleviates the public relations risks of price discrimination. Implications for marketing managers are also discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0497","","MKS","Marketing","2","['customizing', 'consumer decisions', 'promotions']","The article primarily focuses on the financial benefits of one-to-one marketing and the computational challenges involved, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this paper, I argue that these two features have important implications for retailers' channel and advertising decisions. Two major questions are addressed: When should a conventional bricks-and-mortar retailer adopt a multichannel strategy? When should a multichannel retailer use its website to advertise offline prices? Analysis shows that the answers hinge on the nature of the product, the retailer's costs, and the competitors' strategies as well as the competitiveness of the market. Multichannel retailing is not necessarily the best strategy for all retailers; no adoption, asymmetric adoption, and symmetric adoption of the strategy are all possible equilibria. Advertising the in-store prices online is not always optimal. Price advertising in multichannel retailing has a different effect when compared with conventional single-channel retailing. It helps coordinate the channels by shifting the sales from online to offline, which is particularly useful when margins online are relatively low. The finding that multichannel retailers can benefit from drawing consumers back to physical stores highlights the risk of boosting online sales without considering the adverse effect on the offline channel and indicates a shifting role of the Web in retailers' businesses.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0499","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of multichannel retailing and advertising strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we examine the alliances between professional athletes (athlete brands) and sports teams (team brands) in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Athletes and teams match to maximize the total added value created by the brand alliance. To understand this total value, we estimate a structural two-sided matching model using a maximum score method. Using data on the free-agency contracts signed in the NBA during the four-year period from 1994 to 1997, we find that both older players and players with higher performance are more likely to match with teams with more wins. However, controlling for performance, we find that brand alliances between high brand equity players (defined as receiving enough votes to be an all-star starter) and medium brand equity teams (defined by stadium and broadcast revenues) generate the highest value. This suggests that top brands are not necessarily best off matching with other top brands. We also provide suggestive evidence that the maximum salary policy implemented in 1998 influenced matches based on brand equity spillovers more than matches based on performance complementarities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0513","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of brand alliances and performance metrics in professional sports without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A media firm can either be financed by advertising revenue, by direct payment from the viewers (or the readers, if we consider newspapers), or by both. We show that the scope for raising revenues from consumer payment is constrained by other media firms offering close substitutes. This implies that the less differentiated the media firms' content, the larger is the fraction of their revenue coming from advertising. A media firm's scope for raising revenues from ads, on the other hand, is constrained by how many competitors it faces. We should thus expect that direct payment from the media consumers becomes more important the larger the number of competing media products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0514","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive forces and revenue generation in media firms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper we ask: First, if a manufacturer in a distribution channel can choose between a comparative ad and a noncomparative ad, all else being equal, which should it choose? Second, under what conditions would a manufacturer want to reinforce its advertising message at the point of sale with in-store displays, and when should the retailer allow the displays? Third, how does the possibility of in-store displays influence the manufacturer's choice of ad content? We find that a manufacturer will prefer to run comparative ads over noncomparative ads for advertising that is untargeted or that appeals primarily to the manufacturer's core consumers, and run noncomparative ads over comparative ads for advertising that appeals primarily to the rival's core consumers. We also find that in-store displays will be optimal for the manufacturer and its retailers if and only if they increase the overall joint profit of the retailer, the manufacturer, and its rival. Finally, we find that the possibility of offering in-store displays increases a manufacturer's incentive to run noncomparative ads. However, some comparative ads may be so attractive to the manufacturer that it will run them with or without retailer help. Our paper is the first to introduce a channel-based explanation for why manufacturers may or may not want to engage in comparative advertising.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0521","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on advertising strategies and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our application is meant for insurance claims fraud, but it can be applied to many other activities that use the scoring approach. Fraud signals are classified based on the degree to which they reveal an increasing probability of fraud. We show that the optimal auditing strategy takes the form of a \u201cred flags strategy,\u201d which consists in referring claims to a special investigative unit (SIU) when certain fraud indicators are observed. The auditing policy acts as a deterrence device, and we explain why it requires the commitment of the insurer and how it should affect the incentives of SIU staffs. The characterization of the optimal auditing strategy is robust to some degree of signal manipulation by defrauders as well as to the imperfect information of defrauders about the audit frequency. The model is calibrated with data from a large European insurance company. We show that it is possible to improve our results by separating different groups of insureds with different moral costs of fraud.

Despite myriad uses (benchmarking, monitoring, allocating resources, diagnosing problems, explanatory variables), most uses require metrics that contain information summarizing multiple observations. On this criterion, we show empirically (with people data) that although averaging has remarkable theoretical properties, supposedly inferior nonaveraging metrics (e.g., maximum, variance) are often better. We explain theoretically (with exact proofs) and numerically (with simulations) when and why. For example, when the environment causes a correlation between observed sample sizes (e.g., number of past purchases, projects, observations) and latent underlying parameters (e.g., the likelihood of favorable outcomes), the maximum statistic is a better metric than the mean. We refer to this environmental effect as the Muth effect, which occurs when rational markets provide more opportunities (i.e., more observations) to individuals and organizations with greater innate ability. Moreover, when environments are adverse (e.g., failure-rich), nonaveraging metrics correctly overweight favorable outcomes. We refer to this environmental effect as the Anna Karenina effect, which occurs when less-favorable outcomes convey less information. These environmental effects impact metric construction, selection, and employment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0907","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of metrics and statistical analysis without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using data on the human capital of biomedical scientists developed during their careers in academe, this paper analyzes how the depth of their scientifically and commercially oriented academic human capital contributes to firm performance when these scientists subsequently start or join for-profit firms. We find that the scientific and commercial components of an academic scientist's human capital have differential effects on the performance of research and invention tasks at the firm. We also find that the contribution of an academic scientist to a firm's patent productivity is decreasing with the depth of their scientifically oriented human capital, all else constant.

Inspired by the contrasting network strategies of FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS), we study when two service classes (e.g., express or regular) should be served by dedicated resources (e.g., air or ground) or by an integrated network (e.g., air also serves regular). Using call center terminology, the question is whether to operate two independent queues or one N-network. We present analytic expressions for the delay distributions and the value of network integration through partial resource pooling. These show how the value of network integration depends on service quality (speed and reliability of service) and demand characteristics (volume averages and covariance matrix). Our results suggest that network integration is of little value and operating dedicated networks is a fine strategy if the firm primarily serves express requests with high reliability and if the correlation with regular requests is not strongly negative. In contrast, network integration offers significant gains for firms serving primarily regular requests, almost independent of correlation. Our analysis provides the intuition behind these findings in terms of three main drivers of integration value: arrival pooling, the substitution effect, and the correlation effect.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0918","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource pooling and service network strategies without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or DEI.

Volume is strikingly higher, in both economic and statistical terms, when the stock price crosses either the upper or lower limit of its past trading range. This increase in volume is more pronounced the longer the time since the stock price last achieved the price extreme, the smaller the firm, the higher the individual investor interest in the stock, and the greater the ambiguity regarding valuation. These results are robust across model specifications and controls for past returns and news arrival. Volume spikes when price crosses either the upper or lower limit of the past trading range, then gradually subsides.

Implicit in this approach is the assumption that teams are stable in their membership and internal organization. In practice, however, such stability is rare, because the composition and structure of teams often change over time (e.g., between projects). In this paper, we use detailed data from an Indian software services firm to examine how such changes may affect the accumulation of experience within, and the performance of, teams. We find that the level of team familiarity (i.e., the average number of times that each member has worked with every other member of the team) has a significant positive effect on performance, but we observe that conventional measures of the experience of individual team members (e.g., years at the firm) are not consistently related to performance. We do find, however, that the role experience of individuals in a team (i.e., years in a given role within a team) is associated with better team performance. Our results offer an approach for capturing the experience held by fluid teams and highlight the need to study context-specific measures of experience, including role experience. In addition, our findings provide insight into how the interactions of team members may contribute to the development of broader firm capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0921","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['team familiarity', 'role experience', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on team dynamics and performance metrics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

A thorough analysis of this problem in centralized and decentralized setups, both of which occur in practice, is essential for understanding the benefits of collaboration. A key insight offered by this paper is that an efficient implementation of cooperative cache management is possible because, in the centralized scenario, the object allocation resulting in the best social welfare can be found easily as a solution to a transportation problem. For the decentralized scenario involving selfish caches, it is shown that pure equilibria exist and that the cache network always reaches a pure equilibrium in a finite number of steps, starting from any point in the strategy space. An auction mechanism is developed to derive prices that motivate the caches to hold objects in a manner such that the optimal social welfare is attained. In the special case of symmetric caches, simple algorithms are devised to find the optimal social welfare allocation, the best pure equilibrium, and the prices for sharing objects. The results obtained in this paper should be valuable in developing and evaluating cache-management policies. Resource-sharing problems with a similar cost structure exist in a variety of other domains, and the insights gained here are expected to extend to those scenarios as well.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0923","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cache management and resource allocation without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In addition, we propose a class of satisficing measures that reward diversification. Finding optimal portfolios for such satisficing measures is computationally tractable. Moreover, this class of satisficing measures has an ambiguity interpretation in terms of robust guarantees on the expected performance because the underlying distribution deviates from the investor's reference distribution.

We explore this problem using data from Amazon.com on the top-selling books for 1,497 unique locations in the United States for 10 months ending in January 2006. We show that when a store opens locally, people substitute away from online purchasing, even controlling for product-specific preferences by location. These estimates are economically large, suggesting that the disutility costs of purchasing online are substantial and that offline transportation costs matter.

This model encompasses strategic behavior by both firms and consumers in a unified stochastic dynamic game in which each firm's objective is to maximize its total expected revenues, and each consumer responds according to a shopping-intensity-allocation consumer choice model. We prove the existence of a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, provide equilibrium optimality conditions, and prove monotonicity results for special cases. The model provides insights about equilibrium price dynamics under different levels of competition, asymmetry between firms, and multiple market segments with varying properties. We demonstrate that strategic behavior by consumers can have serious impacts on revenues if firms ignore that behavior in their dynamic pricing policies. Moreover, ideal equilibrium responses to consumer strategic behavior can recover only a portion of the lost revenues. A key conclusion is that firms may benefit more from limiting the information available to consumers than from allowing full information and responding to the resulting strategic behavior in an optimal fashion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0936","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of dynamic pricing and strategic consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In such a setting, contracts play two roles: providing incentives to influence the retailer's forecasting decision and eliciting information obtained by forecasting to inform production decisions. We focus on two forms of contracts that are widely used in such settings and are mirror images of one another: a rebates contract, which compensates the retailer for the units she sells to end consumers, and a returns contract, which compensates the retailer for the units that are unsold. We characterize the optimal rebates contracts and returns contracts. Under rebates, the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may benefit from the retailer having inferior forecasting technology; this never occurs under returns. Although one might conjecture that returns would be inferior because its provision of \u201cinsurance\u201d would discourage the retailer from forecasting, we show that returns are superior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1045","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retailer forecasting and contract mechanisms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find strong evidence that only linear contracts need be considered in comparison with piecewise-linear-threshold contracts in the situation where cumulative output is only updated periodically and the agent's utility function is exponential. This finding holds even when there are only two periods and hence one change of action by the agent. However, we find that the best piecewise-linear-threshold contract is significantly superior to the best linear contract when the agent has a power utility function.

Hence, the findings suggest that the financial liquidity of individuals involved in entrepreneurship is likely to be influenced by the knowledge conditions of their venture.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1051","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPOs and agency problems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As reflected in the equity premium puzzle, individual investors tend to hold overly conservative portfolios that provide meager payoffs over time. Consequently, there is growing concern that the vast majority of retirement accounts might be insufficiently funded when employees reach retirement. Given that most retirement plans can now be managed online, a potential solution lies in designing a Web-based decision support system (DSS) that helps future retirees make more-profitable portfolio management decisions. This paper reports the results of a study in which 159 retirement plan participants were asked to use an experimental website to manage a portfolio of retirement investments over a simulated 30-year period. Using a psychological approach toward designing the DSS, myopic loss aversion is put forth as a theoretical explanation for the psychological mechanisms that encourage investors to hold overly conservative portfolios. Armed with this knowledge, three design features\u2014information horizon, system restrictiveness, and decisional guidance\u2014are implemented as part of an overarching design strategy targeted at increasing investors' willingness to take calculated risks. The results indicate that investor conservatism diminishes when the DSS presents prospective probabilities and payoffs over long time horizons. In contrast, short-term information horizons constitute a major stumbling block for investors. However, when confronted with short-term information horizons, risk aversion can be successfully counteracted by configuring a DSS to either restrict the frequency of decisions or to suggest a relatively aggressive portfolio allocation. These findings carry important implications for theory and practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1052","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['decision support', 'investors', 'risk aversion']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of retirement portfolio management and decision-making processes without significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

In this paper, we investigate drivers of product line pricing decisions in a bilateral monopoly where a manufacturer produces and sells two substitutable or complementary products to a retailer. In a two-stage game, each firm commits credibly in the first stage to a pricing scheme within its own organization: product line pricing (PLP) or nonproduct line pricing (NPLP). In the second stage, depending on the relative balance of power in the supply chain, the firms engage in either a Nash or a leader-follower pricing game. We study the equilibrium of the two-stage game under a general symmetric demand function. With strategic interaction between firms, a firm may choose NPLP as the equilibrium pricing strategy. In particular, when the second stage is a leader-follower game, the price leader chooses PLP, and the follower may choose NPLP only if the inefficiency of using NPLP empowers the follower by increasing the demand sensitivity to the leader's margin. When the second stage is a vertical Nash game, whether NPLP occurs in equilibrium depends on the nature of coupling between demand interdependence and vertical strategic dependence: NPLP can be an equilibrium onlyif products are demand substitutes (complements) and vertical strategic dependencies are complementary (substitutable). We find that prisoner's dilemma exists in the first stage for both types of second-stage pricing games. In those cases, one firm may have the incentive to commit to a pricing scheme in the first stage prior to its channel partner and steer the supply chain away from prisoner's dilemma.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1053","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies within supply chains without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Using a unique six-month panel data set of several hundred keywords collected from a large nationwide retailer that advertises on Google, we empirically model the relationship between different sponsored search metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and ranking of advertisements. Our paper proposes a novel framework to better understand the factors that drive differences in these metrics. We use a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework and estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Using a simultaneous equations model, we quantify the relationship between various keyword characteristics, position of the advertisement, and the landing page quality score on consumer search and purchase behavior as well as on advertiser's cost per click and the search engine's ranking decision. Specifically, we find that the monetary value of a click is not uniform across all positions because conversion rates are highest at the top and decrease with rank as one goes down the search engine results page. Though search engines take into account the current period's bid as well as prior click-through rates before deciding the final rank of an advertisement in the current period, the current bid has a larger effect than prior click-through rates. We also find that an increase in landing page quality scores is associated with an increase in conversion rates and a decrease in advertiser's cost per click. Furthermore, our analysis shows that keywords that have more prominent positions on the search engine results page, and thus experience higher click-through or conversion rates, are not necessarily the most profitable ones\u2014profits are often higher at the middle positions than at the top or the bottom ones. Besides providing managerial insights into search engine advertising, these results shed light on some key assumptions made in the theoretical modeling literature in sponsored search.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1054","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of search engine advertising and revenue generation without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Firm Type, Scale, Scope, and Selection Effects in Drug Development","This paper compares the innovation performance of established pharmaceutical firms and biotech companies, controlling for differences in the scale and scope of research. We develop a structural model to analyze more than 3,000 drug research and development projects advanced to preclinical and clinical trials in the United States between 1980 and 1994. Key to our approach is careful attention to the issue of selection. Firms choose which compounds to advance into clinical trials. This choice depends not only on the technical promise of the compound, but also on commercial considerations such as the expected profitability of the market or concerns about product cannibalization. After controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more innovative than newly entered biotech firms; (b) older biotech firms display selection behaviors and innovation performances similar to established pharmaceutical firms; and (c) compounds licensed during preclinical trials are as likely to succeed as internal compounds of the licensor, which is inconsistent with the \u201clemons\u201d hypothesis in technology markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1055","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['innovation', 'selection', 'commercial considerations']","The article primarily focuses on the technical and commercial aspects of drug development without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Some experts have suggested that such scarcity can be a deliberate strategy for making the product more desirable. In this paper, we empirically examine the relationship between introductory inventory levels and consumer preference in the U.S. automobile industry and show that relative scarcity of a car at the time of introduction is associated with higher consumer preference for the product. Furthermore, we perform an empirical test of alternative theories about the rationale for introductory product scarcity. Specifically, we consider two theories of supplier-induced scarcity, namely the buying frenzy theory and the signaling theory, and an alternative theory that suggests that demand uncertainty causes introductory product scarcity. We find more support for the signaling theory of supplier-induced scarcity than the buying frenzy theory or the demand uncertainty theory in our analysis of the automobile market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1056","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product scarcity strategies in the automobile industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

More recently, researchers have noted that exposure to task variety can enhance learning. We examine how exposure to specialization and variety jointly drive employee productivity in a real-life setting. We analyze a data set covering 88 individuals who worked on 5,711 maintenance tasks in an offshore software support services operation. We find that, as expected, specialization enhances productivity. However, exposure to variety has a nonlinear influence on productivity; i.e., \u201ctoo much variety\u201d can impede learning. We also find that achieving a proper balance between specialization and exposure to a variety leads to the highest productivity. We capture this balance using an adaptation of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index from the economics literature. In addition, we examine how the productivity of individuals in a workgroup is affected by member entry and exit, with the latter specified in terms of the degree of specialized experience and the degree of variety experience lost from the workgroup when a member exits. Our analysis reveals that the degree of variety experience lost has a greater impact on productivity than the degree of specialized experience that is lost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1057","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['learning', 'productivity', 'specialization']","The article focuses primarily on productivity and learning in a technical context without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Instead, consistent with Rabin (2002), subjects are more likely to expect a reversal following short streaks and continuation after long streaks. Results of a \u201ctest-of-fit\u201d analysis based on structural estimation of each model also favor the model in Rabin.

Although traditional retailers vastly outsell Internet retailers in most product categories, research on Internet retailing has largely neglected this fundamental dimension of competition. Is cross-channel competition significant, and if so, how and where can Internet retailers win this battle? This paper attempts to answer these questions using a unique combination of data sets. We collect data on local market structures for traditional retailers, and then match these data to a data set on consumer demand via two direct channels: Internet and catalog. Our analyses show that Internet retailers face significant competition from brick-and-mortar retailers when selling mainstream products, but are virtually immune from competition when selling niche products. Furthermore, because the Internet channel sells proportionately more niche products than the catalog channel, the competition between the Internet channel and local stores is less intense than the competition between the catalog channel and local stores. The methods we introduce can be used to analyze cross-channel competition in other product categories, and suggest that managers need to take into account the types of products they sell when assessing competitive strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1062","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive strategies between Internet and traditional retailers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, consumers must bid without knowing when these variations occur because the threshold price is unobservable to them. This paper uses an analytical model and laboratory auctions to explore how the frequency of changes in the threshold price impacts consumer bidding behavior in name-your-own-price auctions. In particular, we consider how the frequency of these expected changes affects the optimal pattern of bid sequences (e.g., strictly increasing over time or following a nonmonotonic pattern). We find that when the probability of a price change is moderate, consumers may have an incentive to use nonmonotonic bidding patterns. Rather than steadily increasing their bids over time, consumers will, at some point in the bid sequence, decrease their bid. However, when the expected probability of a price change is very low or very high, consumers do not have an incentive to use nonmonotonic bidding patterns. Interestingly, impatient bidders are more likely to decrease their bids at some point in the bid sequence than patient bidders. Finally, we find that more frequent price changes may increase customer satisfaction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1064","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer bidding behavior in auctions and does not address any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This threshold increases with the size of the loss and decreases with the degree of loss aversion of the decision maker. Our formal analysis results in a set of predictions suggesting that the silver lining effect is more likely to occur when (i) the gain is smaller (for a given loss), (ii) the loss is larger (for a given gain), and (iii) the decision maker is less loss averse.

These models also adequately explain how the volatility smirk moves up and down in response to changes in risk. However, the data indicate that the slope and the level of the smirk fluctuate largely independently. Although single-factor stochastic volatility models can capture the slope of the smirk, they cannot explain such largely independent fluctuations in its level and slope over time. We propose to model these movements using a two-factor stochastic volatility model. Because the factors have distinct correlations with market returns, and because the weights of the factors vary over time, the model generates stochastic correlation between volatility and stock returns.

Each firm's revenues and costs are proportional with its expected sales volume, with a cost rate that depends on the firm's chosen attraction value according to an arbitrary increasing function. Whereas most existing competition papers with attraction models can be viewed as special cases of this general model, we apply our general results to a new set of quality competition models. Here an industry has N suppliers of a given product, who compete for the business of one or more buyers. Each of the suppliers encounters an uncertain yield factor, with a given general yield distribution. The buyers face uncertain demands over the course of a given sales season. The suppliers compete by selecting key characteristics of their yield distributions, either their means, their standard deviations, or both. These choices have implications for their per-unit cost rates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1073","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition models and market dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

F. 1953. Applied Imagination: Principles and Procedures of Creative Thinking. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York), the effectiveness of brainstorming has been widely debated. While some researchers and practitioners consider it the standard idea generation and problem-solving method in organizations, part of the social science literature has argued in favor of nominal groups, i.e., the same number of individuals generating solutions in isolation. In this paper, we revisit this debate, and we explore the implications that the underlying problem structure and the team diversity have on the quality of the best solution as obtained by the different group configurations. We build on the normative search literature of new product development, and we show that no group configuration dominates. Therefore, nominal groups perform better in specialized problems, even when the factors that affect the solution quality exhibit complex interactions (problem complexity). In cross-functional problems, the brainstorming group exploits the competence diversity of its participants to attain better solutions. However, their advantage vanishes for extremely complex problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1079","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['team diversity', 'problem structure', 'solution quality']","The article discusses 'team diversity,' which indicates a moderate focus on diversity and inclusion themes within a business context.

We show that if a decision maker prefers more of any attribute to less and prefers to combine good lotteries with bad, as opposed to combining good with good and bad with bad, her utility function should be a weighted average (a mixture) of multiattribute exponential utilities (\u201cmixex utility\u201d). In the single-attribute case, mixex utility satisfies properties typically thought to be desirable and encompasses most utility functions commonly used in decision analysis. In the multiattribute case, mixex utility implies aversion to any multivariate risk. Risk aversion with respect to any attribute decreases as that attribute increases. Under certain restrictions, such risk aversion also decreases as any other attribute increases, and a multivariate one-switch property is satisfied. One of the strengths of mixex utility is its ability to represent cases where utility independence does not hold, but mixex utility can be consistent with mutual utility independence and take on a multilinear form. An example illustrates the fitting of mixex utility to preference assessments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1082","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision analysis and utility functions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

With multiple inspectees, the target audit probability derived from the standard analysis can be implemented with sampling plans differing in the budgets committed to support them. Overly committed audit budgets tie up unneeded resources that could have been allocated for better uses. This paper studies the minimum committed budget required to implement a target audit probability when (i) the audit sample can be contingent on \u201cred flags\u201d due to signals of inspectees' private information (e.g., from self-reporting) and (ii) the number of inspectees is large. It proposes an audit rule called bounded simple random sampling (SRS), which is shown to require no more committed budget to support than two other rules naturally generalized from the one-to-one analysis. When the number of inspectees is large enough, bounded SRS is nearly as good as any efficient audit rule, which demands the lowest committed budget necessary to implement the target audit probability. The results offer insights on how audit sampling plans may be formulated to reduce inefficiency and what budget usage ratios should be expected accordingly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1083","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit probability and budget efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Suppliers know only their own true production cost and their own cost adjustment, and the buyer does not know the suppliers' true production costs but does know all suppliers' cost adjustments, which she herself sets in order to make an informed total-cost decision. The buyer, who seeks to minimize her total (price and cost adjustment) procurement cost, can choose to run a first-price sealed-bid auction, where suppliers' bids are affected by their beliefs about each other's total costs, or a descending open-bid auction, where only the actual realizations of suppliers' total costs drive the auction outcome. We characterize the buyer's choice between the two formats as a threshold decision over suppliers' cost adjustments and analyze the effect of supplier beliefs on her decision. We also study the impact of additional suppliers on the buyer's decision, the effect of correlation between suppliers' production costs and their cost adjustments, and additive as well as multiplicative total-cost functions. The results suggest that procurement managers can use their evaluations of suppliers' cost adjustments to make better auction format decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1086","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement auctions and supplier cost adjustments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Established brands are those for which belief in quality is held with greater confidence, even if specific attributes might be inferior to those of competing, less-established brands. In five experiments, we examine the role of ambiguity aversion in the preference for dominated, established brands. We first show a correlation between ambiguity aversion (revealed through choices among monetary lotteries) and the preference for established brands. We then show that the preference for established brands is enhanced when ambiguity aversion is made more salient in unrelated preceding lottery choices. Thus, ambiguity aversion carries across choices. In addition, ambiguity aversion and the preference for established brands are both enhanced when subjects anticipate that others will evaluate their lottery choices. Finally, ambiguous information about brand attributes tends to increase the preference for established brands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1087","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on ambiguity aversion in decision-making related to established brands without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The simplified setting we consider utilizes a two-echelon supply chain in which the retailer faces the newsvendor problem, the supplier has no capacity constraints, and delivery occurs instantaneously. We compare the three mechanisms in a laboratory setting using a novel design that fully controls for strategic interactions between the retailer and the supplier. Results indicate that although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts improve supply chain efficiency relative to the wholesale price contract, the improvement is smaller than the theory predicts. We also find that although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts are mathematically equivalent, they do not generally result in equivalent supply chain performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1089","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain contracting mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We fill this gap by studying how three team mechanisms (collaborative behavior, accurate information exchange, and decision-making decentralization) moderate the impact of TMT diversity on financial performance of 33 information technology firms. We focus on two fundamentally different forms of TMT diversity: functional-background (FB) and locus-of-control (LOC). We argue that the former has the potential to enhance decision quality and organizational performance, whereas the latter might trigger relational conflict, and is, therefore, potentially detrimental to firm effectiveness. The ultimate aim of our study is to analyze which team processes help to transform distributed FB knowledge into high-quality decisions and organizational effectiveness, and which help avoid the potential detrimental effects of LOC diversity. We find that a TMT's collaborative behavior and information exchange are necessary conditions to unleash the performance benefits of FB diversity, but do not interact with LOC diversity. In addition, decentralized decision making spurs the effectiveness of functionally diverse teams, while at the same time reinforces the negative consequences of LOC diversity on firm performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0899","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['diversity', 'collaborative behavior', 'decision-making', 'organizational performance']","The article discusses the impact of top management team diversity on organizational performance, highlighting themes of diversity and collaborative behavior, which align with moderate woke themes of DEI and ethical organizational practices."],["2009","55","2","L.

We study the problem of determining the optimal amount of effort that should be exerted to maintain the system over a planning horizon (finite or infinite). Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to derive a measure for system performance, we maximize system value by balancing system benefits with maintenance costs. The problem is cast as an optimal control model in which the goal is to choose the timing and extent of maintenance that must be expended to maximize system value.

Though most research assumes that contracting choices are independent of each other, contracting complementarity arises when the returns to a single vertical integration decision are increasing in the level of vertical integration associated with other contracting choices. First, effective coordination may depend on the level of (noncontractible) effort on the part of each agent; contracting complementarity results if coordination efforts are interdependent and vertical integration facilitates a higher level of noncontractible effort. Second, effective coordination may require the disclosure of proprietary trade secrets, and the potential for expropriation by external suppliers may induce complementarity among vertical integration choices. We provide evidence for complementarity in product development contracting by taking advantage of a detailed data set that includes the level of vertical integration and the contracting environment for individual automobile systems in the luxury automobile segment. Using an instrumental variables framework that distinguishes complementarity from unobserved firm-level factors, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that contracting complementarity is an important driver of vertical integration choices. The findings suggest that contracting complementarity may be particularly important when coordination is important to achieve but difficult to monitor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0924","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of vertical integration and contracting decisions in automobile product development without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We investigate how risk-management strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0943","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and risk management strategies without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2009","55","2","David M.

Evidence on the Benefits to Startups Participating in Open Standards Development","This paper contributes large-sample evidence to an emerging discussion on open innovation and firm strategy. We ask why a startup should participate in an open standards community. We propose four ways that participation might increase a startup's chances of a liquidity event: gaining endorsement of the startup's technology standard, openly developing the startup's technology within the community (but not necessarily gaining endorsement), simply attending physical meetings of the community, and having startup members elected to leadership positions. Examination of venture-funded startups in the networking/data communications industry sectors reveals that those startups that participate in an open standards community (the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)) have a greater likelihood of an initial public offering or acquisition. The strongest effects are due to attendance, and conditional on high levels of attendance, holding leadership positions within the IETF. Surprisingly, standards endorsement is insignificant when controlling for simple physical attendance. These results are robust to instrumental variable methods and alternative coding of variables. In two-stage models we also find that prominent venture capitalists might help their portfolio companies by steering them to effective technology strategies, in this case active participation in the IETF, and not simply by lending status.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0944","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['open standards', 'community', 'participation']","The article discusses the benefits of startups participating in open standards communities, which hints at collaborative and community-oriented themes.

We demonstrate in our analytical model that a firm must also actively manage information flows within the supply chain, which translates to controlling what it knows, as well as what its competitors and suppliers know. In our model of horizontal competition between an informed and an uninformed firm with a common upstream supplier, material and information flows intersect through leakage of demand (order) information to unintended recipients. As a result, the informed firm's drive to control information flows within the supply chain can trigger operational losses through material flow distortion. These losses can be so severe that the firm may prefer not to acquire information even when it is costless to do so. Our results underscore the importance of strategic information management\u2014actively managing the supply chain's information flows, and making trade-offs with material flows where appropriate, to maximize profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0930","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on profit-maximizing strategies and technical aspects of supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2009","55","3","Michael D.

Here, the aspiring imitator faces a knowledge (i.e., \u201ccapabilities-based\u201d) barrier to imitation that is both causal and ambiguous in a precise sense of both words. Imitation conforms to a well-explicated process of learning by observing. I provide a precise distinction between the intrinsic causal ambiguity associated with a particular strategy and the subjective ambiguity perceived by a challenger. I find that intrinsic ambiguity is a necessary but insufficient condition for a sustained capability-based advantage. I also demonstrate that combinatorial complexity, a phenomenon that has attracted the recent attention of strategy theorists, and causal ambiguity are distinct barriers to imitation. The former acts as a barrier to explorative/active learning and the latter as one to absorptive/passive learning.

These policies take into account real-time supply information, which can be obtained through tracking technologies such as global positioning systems and radio frequency identification. Performance evaluation of such state-dependent policies is generally hard. The main thrust of this paper is to show that, under these policies, the supply system becomes a network of queues with a special routing mechanism called an overflow bypass. The solution has a simple product form. Thus, we obtain closed-form performance measures.

The retailer sets an initial stocking quantity and, at some predetermined point in the season, optimally marks down remaining inventory. We modify this classic setting by introducing three types of consumers: myopic consumers, who always purchase at the initial full price; bargain-hunting consumers, who purchase only if the discounted price is sufficiently low; and strategic consumers, who strategically choose when to make their purchase. A strategic consumer chooses between a purchase at the initial full price and a later purchase at an uncertain markdown price. In equilibrium, strategic consumers and the retailer make optimal decisions given their rational expectations regarding future prices, availability of inventory, and the behavior of other consumers. We find that the retailer stocks less, takes smaller price discounts, and earns lower profit if strategic consumers are present than if there are no strategic consumers. We find that a retailer should generally avoid committing to a price path over the season (assuming such commitment is feasible)\u2014committing to a markdown price (or to not mark down at all) is often too costly (inventory may remain unsold) even in the presence of strategic consumers; the better approach is to be cautious with the initial quantity and then mark down optimally. Furthermore, we discuss the value of quick response (the ability to procure additional inventory after obtaining updated demand information, albeit at a higher unit cost than the initial order). We find that the value of quick response to a retailer is generally much greater in the presence of strategic consumers than without them: on average 67% more valuable and as much as 558% more valuable in our sample. In other words, although it is well established in the literature that quick response provides value by allowing better matching of supply with demand, it provides more value, often substantially more value, by allowing a retailer to control the negative consequences of strategic consumer behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0948","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail pricing and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

But the link between statistical significance and financial significance is indirect, and there has been little or no research into it. This paper presents a new approach to the simulation selection problem, one that maximizes the expected net present value of decisions made when using stochastic simulation. We provide a framework for answering these managerial questions: When does a proposed system design, whose performance is unknown, merit the time and money needed to develop a simulation to infer its performance? For how long should the simulation analysis continue before a design is approved or rejected? We frame the simulation selection problem as a \u201cstoppable\u201d version of a Bayesian bandit problem that treats the ability to simulate as a real option prior to project implementation. For a single proposed system, we solve a free boundary problem for a heat equation that approximates the solution to a dynamic program that finds optimal simulation project stopping times and that answers the managerial questions. For multiple proposed systems, we extend previous Bayesian selection procedures to account for discounting and simulation-tool development costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0949","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for simulation selection and financial significance without addressing social issues, ethics, or diversity.

One reason for this may be that models differ in their assumptions for the functional form of the spillover pool.

An alternative convention prevalent in endogenous growth and evolutionary economics is that spillovers have directionality\u2014the size of the relevant pool differs across firms. Knowing the correct functional form may facilitate theoretical consensus, either analytically (by modifying models' assumptions) or empirically (by supporting a critical test of competing theories). We characterize and test the functional form of spillover pools for efficiency-enhancing innovation across 50 markets in the banking industry.

We call this the persistency problem for a discrete optimization problem under uncertain objective, and the marginal probability mass function of the optimal solution is named the persistence value. In general, this is a difficult problem to solve, even if the distribution of the objective coefficient is well specified. In this paper, we solve a subclass of this problem when the distribution is assumed to belong to the class of distributions defined by given marginal distributions, or given marginal moment conditions. Under this model, we show that the persistency problem maximizing the expected objective value over the set of distributions can be solved via a concave maximization model. The persistency model solved using this formulation can be used to obtain important qualitative insights to the behavior of stochastic discrete optimization problems. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to obtain insights to problems in discrete choice modeling. Using a set of survey data from a transport choice modeling study, we calibrate the random utility model with choice probabilities obtained from the persistency model. Numerical results suggest that our persistency model is capable of obtaining estimates that perform as well, if not better, than classical methods, such as logit and cross-nested logit models. We can also use the persistency model to obtain choice probability estimates for more complex choice problems. We illustrate this on a stochastic knapsack problem, which is essentially a discrete choice problem under budget constraint.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0951","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any reference to social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The generation of the increments of the gamma process, given its value at the terminal point, is interpreted as a Dirichlet partition of the unit interval. The increments are generated in a decreasing stochastic order and, under the Kingman limit, have a known distribution. Thus, simulation of a trajectory from the gamma process requires generating only a small number of uniforms, avoiding the expensive simulation of beta variates via numerical probability integral inversion. The proposed method is then applied in simulating the trajectory of a VG process using its difference-of-gammas representation. It has been implemented in both plain Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo environments. It is tested in pricing lookback, barrier, and Asian options and is shown to provide consistent efficiency gains, compared to the sequential method and the difference-of-gammas bridge sampling proposed by Avramidis and L'Ecuyer (Avramidis, A.

Manufacturers choose the development time and expenditure for each new version of a durable product, which together determine its quality.

The price of a new product strictly increases with its quality and consumers' rational expectation about the time until the next new product will be introduced. \u201cFee-upon-sale\u201d types of e-waste regulation cause manufacturers to increase their equilibrium development time and expenditure, and thus the incremental quality for each new product. As new products are introduced (and disposed of) less frequently, the quantity of e-waste decreases and, even excluding the environmental benefits, social welfare may increase. Consumers pay a higher price for each new product because they anticipate using it for longer, which increases manufacturers' profits. Unfortunately, existing \u201cfee-upon-sale\u201d types of e-waste regulation fail to motivate manufacturers to design for recyclability.

Acquiring the values of features may be costly, and simply acquiring all values may be wasteful or prohibitively expensive. Active feature-value acquisition (AFA) selects features incrementally in an attempt to improve the predictive model most cost-effectively. This paper presents a framework for AFA based on estimating information value. Although straightforward in principle, estimations and approximations must be made to apply the framework in practice. We present an acquisition policy, sampled expected utility (SEU), that employs particular estimations to enable effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively little information is available about the underlying domain. We then present experimental results showing that, compared with the policy of using representative sampling for feature acquisition, SEU reduces the cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits consistent performance across domains. We also extend the framework to a more general modeling setting in which feature values as well as class labels are missing and are costly to acquire.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0952","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of predictive modeling and feature acquisition without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We examine the dynamics of suppliers' investments in cost-reduction initiatives over the life cycle of a product under different procurement approaches. We model the suppliers' investment decisions under cost-contingent contracts, with wholesale prices determined on the basis of the prevailing component costs, as a dynamic game in closed-loop strategies. We show that there always exists an equilibrium in which the suppliers' investments are synchronized, that is, in each period either all suppliers invest in process improvement or no supplier does. We also consider target-price contracts, under which the assembler announces the rate of component cost reduction to be achieved over the product's life cycle at the beginning of the contractual relationship. We show that target-price contracts lead to higher investment levels and profits if the rates are properly specified. In general, the equilibrium investments of the suppliers are lower than those under centralized control. The buyer can eliminate this inefficiency by subsidizing a certain fraction of the costs of investments. We extend the model to a setting with two competing assemblers and knowledge spillover at the suppliers. We find that the level of inefficiency under decentralized control decreases with increased competition and spillover rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0961","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cost reduction and supplier investment strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a proprietary data set derived from regulatory filings with the Japanese government we test these implications in our empirical analysis of U.S.-Japan agreements. The picture that emerges from the analysis is one of particularly intense but contained knowledge transfer in equity joint ventures, relative to bare license agreements: knowledge transfers directly related to the alliance activity are enhanced in the JV, and the speed of integration into the Japanese firm's subsequent innovations also increases. In marked contrast, leakage of unrelated technology is significantly reduced. These findings suggest that administrative structures that reduce technology leakage are a key feature of the equity joint venture, a result that is inconsistent with a \u201cpure\u201d knowledge-based perspective on alliances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0968","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of knowledge transfer in joint ventures without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

However, in hidden profile experiments in which group members have common information favoring an inferior choice, with private information favoring a superior choice, groups typically choose an inferior alternative. We report a hidden profile experiment where we induce homogenous preferences over choice characteristics and provide financial incentives so that the common purpose assumptions of the model hold more completely than in past experiments. Nevertheless, groups continue to choose an inferior alternative most of the time. These failures primarily result from mistakes in recalling information. Mistakes in recalling common information (which favors an inferior candidate) are typically corrected, whereas mistakes in recalling the private information needed to uncover the hidden profile cannot be corrected. Therefore, the dismal performance of groups in pooling the information needed to identify the superior option primarily result from the structure of the problem rather than deficiencies in how groups share and process information. The discussions necessary to resolve mistakes in recalling common information also help to explain the often noted fact that groups spend a disproportionate amount of time discussing common information.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0975","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['decision making', 'group', 'information']","The article focuses on the mechanics of group decision-making and information exchange, with no explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In the echelon scenario, each stage can access the inventory and cost information within its echelon (comprising the stage itself and all downstream stages); in the local scenario, each stage only accesses its own local information. Finally, in the quasilocal scenario, each stage knows its local information, plus the actual customer demands. We propose coordination schemes that regulate the stages to achieve the supply chain's optimal cost under each information setting.

In this case, a firm's optimal market intelligence strategy must trade off learning a little about a broad range of markets (a broad strategy) with gaining a very deep understanding of one or a few markets (a focused strategy). This trade-off is not present when data are scarce, an assumption made in most of the existing literature on optimal information search strategies. However, in data-rich environments, which are of increasing relevance given technology changes, we show a focused market intelligence strategy is always best when managers need to process a substantial amount of data before beginning to gain insights; i.e., there are increasing returns to attention. Interestingly, this focused strategy can also be best with decreasing returns to attention when (a) managers are sufficiently efficient in processing the available data and (b) managers have sufficiently strong initial priors on the unknown market parameters. We show a broad market intelligence strategy is only optimal when new data points are sufficiently redundant, i.e., when the learning rate is sufficiently decreasing with the allocation of more attention. Our results also indicate that advances in information technology can account for the pressure on firms to become more focused and that competition increases the likelihood of a focused strategy. Competition can lead to asymmetric outcomes where firms focus on different markets. Finally, we note that a focused market intelligence strategy, and thus an asymmetric allocation of attention, does not require a priori differences between firms, markets, or market-specific core capabilities. Consequently, a focused market intelligence strategy can result in market-specific core competencies and produce firm differences from equivalent starting conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0988","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on optimal information strategies in firms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our main result is that if the prior belief about the correlation in the agents' values is diffuse enough, the optimal Bayesian-Nash auction must also satisfy dominant strategy incentive constraints. Furthermore, when the optimal auction does provide dominant strategy incentives, it takes one of two forms: (i) if perfect correlation and negative correlation are excluded as possibilities, the auction incorporates all information about the prior belief over the possible correlations, and (ii) if either perfect correlation or negative correlation is a possibility, the auction does not incorporate any correlation information and can be described as a modified Vickrey auction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0967","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on mechanism design theory and auction settings without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2009","55","5","Scott A.

The model consists of (1) a decision tree predictive model that classifies panelists into \u201cstates\u201d and forecasts the response rate for panelists in each state and (2) a linear program that specifies how many panelists should be solicited from each state to maximize response rate. The model is forward looking in that it optimizes over a finite horizon during which S studies are to be fielded. It takes into account the desired number of responses for each study, the likely migration pattern of panelists between states as they are invited and respond or do not respond, as well as demographic requirements. The model is implemented using a rolling horizon whereby the optimal solution for S successive studies is derived and implemented for the first study. Then, as results are observed, an optimal solution is derived for the next S studies, and the solution is implemented for the first of these studies, etc. The procedure is field tested and shown to increase response rates significantly compared to the heuristic currently being used by panel management. Further analysis suggests that the improvement was due to the predictive model and that a \u201cgreedy algorithm\u201d would have done equally well in the field test.

We contrast two classes of commonly used strategies under multiple sourcing; namely, single-stage reverse auctions, and two-stage processes where price-quantity adjustments between the buyer and the suppliers follow a first-stage reverse auction. Deriving bounds of efficiency for these two classes of procurement processes under convex supplier production costs, we present insights on the conditions under which each class is preferable for the buyer. Considering the effect of contracting and processing costs, a single-stage process is likely to be preferable to a two-stage process when the number of bidding suppliers is high, especially when capacity is rigid. A two-stage process with one information transfer in the second stage may be the preferred procurement mode when production is highly scalable, i.e., when the marginal production cost increase with increased production is small. When the number of suppliers is low, the effect of a decrease in production scalability depends on the current scalability level. For high scalability levels, a decrease in production scalability may decrease the efficiency of both single-stage and simple two-stage processes, whereas for low scalability levels, it tends to increase efficiency for both of these process classes. A decrease in production costs makes employing simple processes more attractive when production is highly scalable or when supplier capacity is rigid. For intermediate production scalability, however, a cost decrease may make employing two-stage processes with multiple information transfers in the second round preferable for the buyer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0972","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement processes and efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0974","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['diversity', 'recommender systems', 'bias', 'consumer-product matches']","The article discusses the impact of recommender systems on sales diversity, highlighting the potential bias towards popular products and its implications for consumer choice.

The reciprocals of the market odds that minimize the difference between the total betting amount and the potential payouts for different classes represent the MCC probability estimates of each class being the true object class. By using a market-based approach, IMF can adjust to changes in base-classifier performance without requiring offline training data or a static ensemble composition. Experimental results show that when the true classes of objects are only revealed for objects classified as positive, for low positive ratios, IMF outperforms three benchmarks combiner methods, majority, average, and weighted average; for high positive ratios, IMF outperforms majority and performs on par with average and weighted average. When the true classes of all objects are revealed, IMF outperforms weighted average and majority and marginally outperforms average.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0977","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision fusion and classification performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It generalizes expected utility by introducing nonlinear decision weighting and loss aversion. A difficulty in the study of multiattribute utility under prospect theory is to determine when an attribute yields a gain or a loss. One possibility, adopted in the theoretical literature on multiattribute utility under prospect theory, is to assume that a decision maker determines whether the complete outcome is a gain or a loss. In this holistic evaluation, decision weighting and loss aversion are general and attribute-independent. Another possibility, more common in the empirical literature, is to assume that a decision maker has a reference point for each attribute. We give preference foundations for this attribute-specific evaluation where decision weighting and loss aversion are depending on the attributes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0978","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision theory without any reference to socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

One interesting finding is that our structural results are not analogous to classical results in Bayesian inventory research. This departure from classical results is due to the role that the independent variables play in the Bayesian regression formulation.

Most of these studies used different forms of demand models, assuming that no order smoothing was used by the retailer and that the supplier has full knowledge of the retailer's demand model and order policy. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by starting with a most general demand model, coupled with a smoothing policy for order variability control. In addition, we do not require that the supplier has full knowledge of the retailer's demand model and order policy, but instead let the retailer share its projected future orders (and freely revise them as the retailer sees fit). Under such a setting, we first obtain a unifying formula for the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. The formula indicates that it is the forecast correlation over the exposure period as a whole that determines the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. We then quantify the value of information sharing and generalize the existing results in the literature. Finally, we explore the optimal smoothing parameters that could benefit the total supply chain. The resulting optimal policy resembles the postponement strategy. We find that information sharing together with order postponement improves the supply chain performance, even though the order variability may amplify in some cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0983","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and information sharing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our findings show that the Internet-based electronic market outperforms the EDI-based channel on these two important measures. Order cycle times were significantly lower when using the Internet-based electronic market, whereas the percentage of complete shipments was significantly higher after controlling for product, transaction, seller, and buyer-specific factors. The electronic market even outperforms the EDI channel when buyer and transaction characteristics favor the use of EDI. Because EDI is still prevalent in many industries, these results point to the gains that may be realized by switching to the newer technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0990","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical performance metrics of electronic data interchange and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2009","55","5","Xuanming SuXuanming Suxuanming@haas.berkeley.eduHaas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720Search for more papers by this author, Fuqiang ZhangFuqiang Zhangfzhang22@wustl.eduOlin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130Search for more papers by this author","On the Value of Commitment and Availability Guarantees When Selling to Strategic Consumers","This paper studies the role of product availability in attracting consumer demand. We start with a newsvendor model, but additionally assume that stockouts are costly to consumers. The seller sets an observable price and an unobservable stocking quantity. Consumers anticipate the likelihood of stockouts and determine whether to visit the seller. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium in this game. We propose two strategies that the seller can use to improve profits: (i) commitment (i.e., the seller, ex ante, commits to a particular quantity) and (ii) availability guarantees (i.e., the seller promises to compensate consumers, ex post, if the product is out of stock). Interestingly, the seller has an incentive to overcompensate consumers during stockouts, relative to the first-best benchmark under which social welfare is maximized. We find that first-best outcomes do not arise in equilibrium, but can be supported when the seller uses a combination of commitment and availability guarantees. Finally, we examine the robustness of these conclusions by extending our analysis to incorporate dynamic learning, multiple products, and consumer heterogeneity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0991","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer demand and seller strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Part of the difficulty in extending this measure to stochastic cash flows is the lack of coherent methods for accounting for multiple or nonexistent internal rates of return in deterministic streams. Recently such a coherent theory has been developed, and we examine its implications for stochastic cash flows. We devise an extension of the deterministic IRR, which we call the stochastic rate of return on mean investment. It has significant computational and conceptual advantages over the stochastic internal rate. For instance, in the deterministic case, the standard result is that under proper conditions a cash flow stream is acceptable (in the sense of positive present value) if its internal rate exceeds the interest rate. We show that a stochastic cash flow stream is acceptable (in the sense of positive certainty equivalent expected value) if the rate of return on mean investment has a suitably defined certainty equivalent exceeding the risk-free interest rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0989","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical extension of the internal rate of return for stochastic cash flows, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This aggregate estimate weights each cash flow forecast by the estimated accuracy of its issuer, which is obtained from their past forecast errors. Momentum arises from the investor gradually learning about the relative accuracy of the information sources and updating their weights.

In this paper, we show that a firm's optimal entry strategy in this situation cannot be characterized by the familiar \u201cnow or never\u201d or \u201cnow or at maturity\u201d strategies proposed in the literature. We show that a strong leverage effect does not necessarily provide the justification for a firm to enter a new market, and neither should a strong backlash effect necessarily deter a firm from embracing a new market. The optimal strategy is predicated on a judicious trade-off between the three factors of leverage, backlash, and patience. Thus, an astute manager can always find the opportune time to enter the new market if she takes into account the dynamic and recursive nature of cross-market interaction effects, where leverage enhances the backlash but backlash weakens the leverage in a nonlinear, dynamic fashion. We illustrate that firms stand to benefit from explicit considerations of these effects in deciding whether and when to enter a new market. Furthermore, we explore how the optimal time of entry into the new market relates to the time of peak sales for the existing market, demonstrating that depending on the interactive effects of leverage and backlash, entry could be optimal either before or after peak sales in the existing market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0993","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['social influence', 'market entry', 'leverage', 'backlash']","The article primarily focuses on market entry strategies and the dynamics of leverage and backlash in business contexts, with no significant emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Using a novel panel data set, we analyze the film rental and return patterns of a sample of online DVD rental customers over a period of four months. We predict and find that should DVDs (e.g., documentaries) are held significantly longer than want DVDs (e.g., action films) within customer. Similarly, we also predict and find that people are more likely to rent DVDs in one order and return them in the reverse order when should DVDs are rented before want DVDs. Specifically, a 1.3% increase in the probability of a reversal in preferences (from a baseline rate of 12%) ensues if the first of two sequentially rented movies has more should and fewer want characteristics than the second film. Finally, we find that as the same customers gain more experience with online DVD rentals, the extent to which they hold should films longer than want films decreases.

Alternatively, when firms expect to interact repeatedly, relational mechanisms may achieve similar results without the associated costs. However, as we now know from a growing body of theoretical and empirical work, the resulting intuition\u2014that relational mechanisms will be substituted for formal ones whenever possible\u2014does not generally hold. The extent to which firms substitute relational mechanisms for formal ones in the presence of repeated interaction is an empirical question that forms the basis of this paper. We study a sample of 52 joint technology development contracts in the telecommunications and microelectronics industries and devise a coding scheme to allow empirical comparison of contract terms. Counter to the above intuition (but consistent with recent research), we find that a firm's contracts are more detailed and more likely to include penalties when it engages in frequent deals (whether with the same or different partners).

In this paper, we examine when the market share advantage of a pioneering firm with a broad product line strategy translates into a profit advantage by examining the cost effects of this strategy. Using the profit impact of marketing strategies data and an estimation method that controls for various unobserved factors, we find significant differences between different industry settings. From these contrasting findings, we generate an emerging theoretical framework that we subject to empirical testing. We conjecture, and empirically verify, that creating a broad product line with a versioning strategy\u2014creating variety from a standard product in anticipating customer demand\u2014does not increase the pioneering cost disadvantage, and thus results in a pioneering profit advantage. On the other hand, with a tailoring strategy\u2014creating variety by customizing a product to actual customer demand\u2014a broad product line substantially increases the pioneering cost disadvantage, thereby making a preemption strategy counterproductive.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.0997","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market share advantages and profit strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These usage patterns may evolve over time, particularly when the electronic channels are new. We examine buyer and seller use of electronic and physical channels in a market for products of uncertain quality (used vehicles) over a 2.5-year period. Results indicate that transactions involving low quality uncertainty and relatively rare products occurred in the electronic channels, whereas transactions involving high quality uncertainty and relatively plentiful products occurred in the physical channels.

The analogous ecological model, referred to as the Lotka-Volterra model, captures this dynamic tension between decisions made by the firm and its manufacturing operations. This representation leads to evolutionarily stable manufacturing strategies (ESMSs), which contribute to a firm's competitive advantage in different ways. Using a random sample of 30 firms from the U.S. semiconductor industry, we estimate parameters of the model and arrive at four ESMSs or strategic manufacturing groups that reflect theoretically and empirically distinctive adaptation patterns through their dynamic resource allocations. We observe that a majority of the firms were classified in one of the four groups, with relatively fewer firms in the other three. Notably, our classification based on ecology models agrees well with taxonomies in manufacturing and business strategy theory. Furthermore, our analysis shows significant differences among manufacturing practices and competitive capabilities of the four strategic groups. Managerially, these insights could provide the foundation to implement strategic changes that enable firms to leapfrog from one ESMS to another.

Barter conjoint collects a substantially larger amount of data compared to CBC and allows for information diffusion among respondents.

The studies employed a total of three product categories, each with two validation tasks (one follows immediately and one conducted two weeks later). Our results confirmed prior research that incentive alignment, in general, substantially improves out-of-sample predictive performance of CBC. Furthermore, we found barter conjoint performs substantially better than the incentive-aligned CBC. However, in the spirit of \u201cno free lunch,\u201d barter conjoint is more taxing (in various ways) than CBC, suggesting a potential trade-off between consumer resource allocation (at the time of the task) and (managerial) predictive accuracy downstream.

Our research employs an analytical model to identify and understand key trade-offs driving the decision by a service provider to employ an NYOP channel, assuming that such a channel is available. This decision requires the existence of forces that counteract the adverse consequences of cannibalization of sales through traditional posted-price channels. Our analysis provides some insight into these forces. Contracting with the NYOP retailer facilitates market segmentation and price discrimination, and allows for disposal of excess capacity after meeting business travel demand. However, the cost of this flexibility is that the service provider can no longer credibly precommit to maintaining high prices when there is unsold capacity. Also, when contracting with an independent retailer, the service provider is unable to extract the entire revenue generated from NYOP consumers. A key insight from our model is that the rationale for contracting with an NYOP retailer is driven by the uncertainty in business travel demand, not the expectation of excess capacity. Indeed, all else equal, the larger the capacity, the less likely it is that contracting with an NYOP retailer is the right decision on the part of the service provider.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1007","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing strategies in the travel industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Price dispersion is a key feature of all of these equilibria, including the limit equilibrium.

In this paper, we discuss two contractual agreements by which product recall costs can be shared between a manufacturer and a supplier to induce quality improvement effort. More specifically, we consider (i) cost sharing based on selective root cause analysis (Contract S), and (ii) partial cost sharing based on complete root cause analysis (Contract P). Using insights from supermodular game theory, for each contractual agreement, we characterize the levels of effort the manufacturer and the supplier would exert in equilibrium to improve their component failure rate when their effort choices are subject to moral hazard. We show that both Contract S and Contract P can achieve the first best effort levels; however, Contract S results in higher profits for the manufacturer and the supply chain. For the case in which the information about the quality of the supplier's product is not revealed to the manufacturer (i.e., the case of information asymmetry), we develop a menu of contracts that can be used to mitigate the impact of information asymmetry. We show that the menu of contracts not only significantly decreases the manufacturer's cost due to information asymmetry, but also improves product quality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1008","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['quality improvement', 'cost sharing', 'moral hazard']","The article primarily focuses on contractual agreements and economic incentives related to product quality and cost-sharing, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, the management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms presents a new set of challenges in sharing the costs and benefits of innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint development of products involving two firms with differing development capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond sharing of revenues to include sharing of development cost and work. We term these approaches that involve sharing of the development cost and sharing of the development work investment sharing and innovation sharing, respectively. These cost and effort sharing mechanisms have subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty, innovation sharing plays an important role in environments where projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in their capabilities, and the costs of integration of work across firms can be controlled. Our key contribution involves the modeling of joint work and decision making between collaborating firms and unearthing the complementary role of revenue, cost, and innovative effort sharing mechanisms for new product development. We translate our analytical findings into a managerial framework and illustrate the results with examples from the life-sciences and electronics industries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1010","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['collaboration', 'cost sharing', 'innovation']","The article focuses on technical aspects of collaborative product development and cost-sharing mechanisms, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Study 1 identifies selection bias in mutual fund advertising by showing that the median performance rank for advertised funds is between the 79th and 100th percentile. Study 2 finds that both novice investors and financial professionals fall victim to selection neglect in a financial advertising task unless the advertisement makes the selective nature of available performance data transparent. Study 3 shows that selection neglect associated with a large well-known company can be debiased with a simple extrinsic sample space cue, although individual differences in statistical reasoning also matter.

We find that CIPs are disproportionately filed by research and development-intensive firms that patent heavily, and that these continuations are more common in chemical and biological technologies. Patents issuing from CIPs cover relatively important inventions and their use appears consistent with a strategy of protecting \u201cpioneering inventions.\u201d In contrast, CAPs and divisions are associated with less important patents assigned to capital-intensive firms, particularly in computer and semiconductor fields, and appear to be used in defensive patenting strategies.

Innovation is radical and involves product market entry by a firm into markets in which it was not previously active. I test competing hypotheses that predict either a U-shape or inverted U-shape relationship between reorganization and innovation to determine whether and how learning occurs in the presence of unit-level structural change. Theoretical support is drawn from literature on dynamic capabilities and organizational learning. The sample studied is 250 medical firms belonging to the pharmaceutical, healthcare-service, and medical-device industries, studied over a 20-year period. The findings are twofold. First, reorganization is found to exhibit a U-shape relationship with innovation, supporting learning arguments that stress the importance of experiencing a cohort of multiple events. Second, only reorganization experiences within a current period affect future innovation; past experiences do not impact future innovation, implying that firms may face constraints in organizational memory. The study concludes by exploring the structural origin (i.e., from internal, acquired, or recombined units) of innovative activity within firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1017","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the empirical examination of business unit reorganization and its impact on innovation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

They help performance evaluation by eliminating common shocks affecting agents' performance. However, tournaments are less effective when participants have heterogeneous ability because participants may conclude that the ability gap is too large to be overcome by their effort. Our theoretical analysis shows that a similar loss of motivation arises when tournaments take place over multiple periods because interim performance acts in a way that is similar to heterogeneous ability. Analyzing the sales contests organized by a commodities company, we document that winning participants decrease their effort as their lead extends, whereas the effort of trailing participants fades only when the gap to a winning position is very large. We also show that, on average, when contests are introduced they induce a higher level of effort among participants, although the incentives weaken as the number of participants increases. Finally, we demonstrate that although retailers respond to the multiple performance dimensions of the incentive program in part by shifting effort toward sales of more expensive products, they channel most of the increased effort toward reaching more customers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1021","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['performance', 'incentives', 'effort']","The article focuses primarily on performance evaluation and incentive structures within organizations, lacking any direct references to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

How Interfirm Alliance Announcements Change the Stock Market Valuation of Rivals","Most prior event studies find that the announcement of a new alliance is accompanied by a positive stock market response for the partners. This result has usually been interpreted as evidence for the prevailing view that alliances are effective vehicles for partners to acquire or access new skills and thus become stronger competitors. However, partners should also earn positive abnormal returns if alliances are used to shape competitive interactions, attenuating competitive intensity industry-wide. In this study, we disentangle these different mechanisms by examining how alliance announcements affect the stock market's evaluation of allying firms' rivals: if an alliance is expected to make partner firms more competitive, this should lead to negative abnormal returns for partners' rivals; if an alliance is expected to facilitate a reduction in competitive intensity, this should lead to positive abnormal returns for rivals. Results from an event study analysis of research and development alliances in the telecommunications and electronics industries during 1996\u20132004 provide evidence consistent with competition attenuation in some alliances. Our research thus challenges the increasingly narrow focus on learning and resource accumulation through alliances, and calls for broader consideration of the roles and effects of collaboration, both for individual firms and for industry structure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1022","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['alliances', 'competitive interactions', 'collaboration']","The article discusses alliances and their impact on competition, but it primarily focuses on financial outcomes rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

This paper explores the effect of the interaction between consumer evaluation costs and pricing on the optimal product line length to offer consumers. Before deciding to buy a product among all products offered, a consumer learns the product line length. Given the product line length, a consumer decides whether to evaluate the products available and their prices. This decision to evaluate depends on the expected consumer surplus after the evaluation being greater than the evaluation costs. When the firm offers few products, the firm may not attract many consumers because of lack of product fit and may be forced to offer low prices. When the firm offers many products, all consumers will find a great product fit; that is, the variance of consumer valuations per product chosen is lower. This allows the firm to charge high prices to extract ex post consumer surplus, resulting in lower ex ante expected consumer surplus, which may lead consumers not to evaluate the products in the first place. That is, by offering fewer products a firm can commit not to extract all possible consumer surplus. These two forces may then lead to the existence of an interior optimal number of products to offer. The optimal number of products offered is decreasing in the evaluation costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1024","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product variety and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Our proposed control activates serving some customers from the other system when a ratio of the two queue lengths (numbers of waiting customers) exceeds a threshold. Two thresholds, one for each direction of sharing, automatically detect the overload condition and prevent undesired sharing under normal loads. After a threshold has been exceeded, the control aims to keep the ratio of the two queue lengths at a specified value. To gain insight, we introduce an idealized stochastic model with two customer classes and two associated service pools containing large numbers of agents. To set the important queue-ratio parameters, we consider an approximating deterministic fluid model. We determine queue-ratio parameters that minimize convex costs for this fluid model. We perform simulation experiments to show that the control is effective for the original stochastic model. Indeed, the simulations show that the proposed queue-ratio control with thresholds outperforms the optimal fixed partition of the servers given known fixed arrival rates during the overload, even though the proposed control does not use information about the arrival rates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1025","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They only retain market leadership if their undestroyed, proprietary complementary assets compensate for their research incompetence. In contrast to prior research, I propose that there is not one but two sets of capabilities necessary to execute research and development (R&D), sets that differ in their market specificity: a technology-specific set (i.e., technological platforms that are non-market specific) and an application-specific set (i.e., knowledge of the application that is therefore market specific). Although all markets require both sets of capabilities to execute R&D, prior research has analyzed cases where the application was not as complex, and therefore application-specific capabilities did not represent strategic factors. Because at the start of a technological discontinuity application-specific capabilities are undestroyed and have accrued only to incumbents, when complex enough, these capabilities can represent a source of competitive advantage for these firms, even in the face of competition from diversifying entrants reusing previously acquired technological platforms. I find evidence consistent with my proposition based on data on outcomes from drug discovery (as estimated through clinical endpoints in phase I trials) for firms competing in the anticancer drug market, one of the most complex markets within pharmaceuticals, as the market transitions into the biotechnology revolution. The proposition in this paper implies that although technological platforms can help firms move across markets, application-specific R&D capabilities can help firms retain leadership within a market across technological discontinuities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1027","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of R&D capabilities in the pharmaceutical industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Under DA, the retailer displays all available units so that each arriving customer has perfect information about the actual inventory level. Under DO, the retailer displays only one unit at a time so that each customer knows about product availability but not the actual inventory level. Recent research suggests that when faced with strategic consumers, the retailer could increase expected profits by making an upfront commitment to a price path. We focus on such pricing strategies in this paper, and study the potential benefit of DO compared to DA, and its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We find support for our hypothesis that the DO format could potentially create an increased sense of shortage risk, and hence it is better than the DA format. However, although potentially beneficial, a move from DA to DO is typically very far from eliminating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We observe that, generally, it is not important for a retailer to modify the level of inventory when moving from a DA to a DO format; a change in the display format, along with an appropriate price modification, is typically sufficient. Interestingly, across all scenarios in which a change in inventory is significantly beneficial, we observed that only one of the following two actions takes place: either the premium price is increased along with a reduction in inventory, or inventory is increased along with premium price reduction. We find that the marginal benefit of DO can vary dramatically as a function of the per-unit cost to the retailer. In particular, when the retailer's per-unit cost is relatively high, but not too high to make sales unprofitable or to justify exclusive sales to high-valuation customers only, the benefits of DO appear to be at their highest level, and could reach up to 20% increase in profit. Finally, we demonstrate that by moving from DA to DO, while keeping the price path unchanged, the volatility of the retailer's profit decreases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1029","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and inventory display formats without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When provided advice, participants relied more on groups than individuals to update their beliefs, but were only modestly sensitive to group size.

Both the extent and manner in which store differentiation changes has important implications for assortment depth.

We consider an ultimatum deadline game in which the proposer's decision variable is the offer deadline, while the responder faces a standard finite-horizon search problem. We show that the responder's strategy is characterized by a shortest acceptable deadline: at the time of deadline, he accepts an offer if the deadline is longer than his shortest acceptable deadline, and rejects it otherwise. If the proposer has all information available to the responder, the optimal deadline is the responder's shortest acceptable deadline. If the proposer is uncertain about the responder's situation, the optimal deadline gets longer, unless this uncertainty is very large. After normative analysis of the deadline setting problem, we present results from a behavioral study of the game. The average shortest acceptable deadline set by the responders equals the one that would maximize the expected value, whereas the proposers tend to set deadlines that are too short. The prescriptive conclusion for a proposer, emerging from the model and the experiment, is that in case of uncertainty it is better to set a deadline longer than what would be optimal if uncertainty were ignored.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1034","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of ultimatum deadlines in decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, we show that this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved without risk, because there can be severe congestion if the system does not operate as planned. In particular, we show that the large scale makes the system more vulnerable to service interruptions when (i) most customers remain waiting until they can be served, and (ii) when many servers are unable to function during the interruption, as may occur with a system-wide computer failure. Increasing scale leads to higher server utilizations, which in turn leads to longer recovery times from service interruptions and worse performance during such events.

Using Department of Defense deployment data and Mental Health Advisory Team PTSD survey data to calibrate the model, we predict that\u2014because of the long time lags and the fact that some surveyed servicemembers experience additional combat after being surveyed\u2014the fraction of Army soldiers and Marines who eventually suffer from PTSD will be approximately twice as large as in the raw survey data. We cannot put a confidence interval around this estimate, but there is considerable uncertainty (perhaps \u00b130%).

We consider a duopoly model of competition between firms in two products to determine which products a firm will link to a cause. We first test the behavioral underpinnings of our model in two laboratory experiments to demonstrate the existence of both a direct utility benefit to consumers from cause marketing (CM) and a spillover benefit onto other products in the portfolio. Linking one product in a product portfolio to a cause can therefore increase sales both of that product and, via a spillover effect, of other products in the firm's portfolio. We construct a CM game in which each firm chooses which products, if any, to place on CM. In the absence of a spillover benefit, a firm places a product on CM if and only if it can increase its price by enough to compensate for the cost of CM. Thus, in equilibrium, firms either have both products or neither product on CM. However, with the introduction of a spillover benefit to the second product, this result changes. We show that if a single firm in the market links only one product to a cause, it can raise prices on both products and earn a higher profit. We assume each firm has an advantage in one product and show that there is an equilibrium in which each firm links only its disadvantaged product to a cause. If the spillover effect is strong, there is a second equilibrium in which each firm links only its advantaged product to a cause. In each case, firms raise their prices on both products and earn higher profits than when neither firm engages in CM. We also show that a firm will never place its entire portfolio on CM. Overall, our work implies that, by carrying cause-related products, companies can not only improve their image in the public eye but also increase profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1043","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['cause marketing', 'social impact', 'consumer benefit']","The article discusses cause marketing and its potential benefits not only for firms but also for consumers, indicating a moderate emphasis on social impact alongside traditional business metrics.

Resource allocation and NPD portfolio decisions often span multiple levels of the organization's hierarchy, leading to questions about how much authority to bestow on managers and how to structure incentives for NPD. In this study, we explore how funding authority and incentives affect a manager's allocation of resources between existing product improvement (relatively incremental projects) and new product development (more radical projects). Funding may be either fixed or variable depending on the extent to which the manager has the authority to use revenue derived from existing product sales to fund NPD efforts. We find that the use of variable funding drives higher effort toward improving existing products and developing new products. However, variable funding has a subtle side effect: it induces the manager to focus on existing product improvement to a greater degree than new product development, and the relative balance in the NPD portfolio shifts toward incremental innovation. In addition, we highlight a substitution effect between explicit incentives (compensation parameters) and implicit incentives (career concerns). Explicit incentives are reduced as career concerns become more salient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1046","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['resource allocation', 'incentives', 'innovation']","The article primarily focuses on resource allocation and managerial incentives in product development, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We wish to disentangle two mechanisms by which local competition influences a dealer's inventory: (1) the entry or exit of a competitor can change a retailer's demand (a sales effect); and (2) the entry or exit of a competitor can change the amount of buffer stock a retailer holds, which influences the probability that a consumer finds a desired product in stock (a service-level effect). Theory is clear on the sales effect\u2014an increase in sales leads to an increase in inventory (albeit a less than proportional increase). However, theoretical models of inventory competition are ambiguous on the expected sign of the service-level effect. Via a Web crawler, we obtained data on inventory and sales for more than 200 dealerships over a six-month period. Using cross-sectional variation, we estimated the effect of the number and type of local competitors on inventory holdings. We used several instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity of market entry decisions. Our results suggest that the service-level effect is strong, nonlinear, and positive. Hence, we observe that dealers carry more inventory (controlling for sales) when they face additional competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1050","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the technical aspects of inventory management and competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Common credit terms are tantamount to a schedule of declining discounts (escalating penalties) that depend on how long the retailer takes to pay off the supplier's loan. However, issues such as which stocking policies are optimal in the presence of supplier-provided credit have been investigated only when demand is assumed deterministic. Nearly all stochastic inventory models assume either time-invariant finance charges or charges that may vary with time but not with the age of the credit. In this article we present a discrete time model of the retailer's operations with random demand, which is used to prove that the structure of the optimal policy is not affected by credit terms, although the value of the optimal policy parameter is. This is followed by a continuous time model, which leads to an algorithm for finding the optimal stock level.

For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling\u2014i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders\u2014is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%\u201365% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0193","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['customer satisfaction', 'service failures', 'attributions of blame']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of service operations and customer satisfaction without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0194","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and customer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper studies a manufacturer's multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assemblies. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different economic and demand characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted, in which market should the facility be located? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0198","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['offshoring', 'manufacturing costs', 'logistics costs']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and cost analysis related to offshoring without addressing social justice, ethical considerations, or DEI themes.

We model this phenomenon as a two-period contracting game with two identical suppliers, a single buyer, deterministic demand, and uncertain production costs. The suppliers are distressed at the start of the game and do not have access to external sources of capital; hence, revenues from the buyer are crucial in determining whether default occurs. The production cost of each supplier is the sum of two stochastic components: a common term that is identical for both suppliers (representing raw materials costs, design specifications, etc.) and an idiosyncratic term that is unique to a given supplier (representing inherent firm capability). The buyer chooses a supplier and then decides on a single- or two-period contract. Comparing models with and without the possibility of default, we find that, without the possibility of supplier failure, the buyer always prefers short-term contracts over long-term contracts, whereas this preference is typically reversed in the presence of failure. Neither of these contracts coordinates the supply chain. We also consider dynamic contracts, in which the contract price is partially tied to some index representing the common component of production costs (e.g., commodity prices of raw materials such as steel or oil), allowing the buyer to shoulder some of the risk from cost uncertainty. We find that dynamic long-term contracts allow the buyer to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of default risk. We also demonstrate that our results continue to hold under a variety of alternative assumptions, including stochastic demand, allowing the buyer the option of subsidizing a bankrupt supplier via a contingent transfer payment or loan and allowing the buyer to unilaterally renegotiate contracts. We conclude that the possibility of supplier default offers a new reason to prefer long-term contracts over short-term contracts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0199","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contracting and supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information). From numerical results, we obtain several insights into the value of advance demand information for both supplier and customers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0201","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition, the customer pays a price for the final product that is nonincreasing in the delivery lead time to discourage late delivery.

A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of \u201csupply learning\u201d (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0206","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-c\u03bc (Gc\u03bc) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0211","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and routing rules without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0212","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of routing and incentives for quality within a principal-agent model without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

First, it identifies configurations of ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies. Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0215","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Within a multinomial logit model of consumer choice over substitutes, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming formulation and derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy. We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season. Based on the above insights, we propose a computationally efficient approach to the initial inventory decision, which delivers close-to-optimal inventory levels for all testing cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0221","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and inventory control without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The main estimators considered are: (i) the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES), (ii) the delay experienced so far by the customer at the head of the line (HOL), and (iii) the delay experienced by the customer to have arrived most recently among those who have already completed service (RCS). We compare these delay-history estimators to the standard estimator based on the queue length (QL), commonly used in practice, which requires knowledge of the mean interval between successive service completions in addition to the QL. We characterize performance by the mean squared error (MSE). We do an analysis and conduct simulations for the standard GI/M/s multiserver queueing model, emphasizing the case of large s. We obtain analytical results for the conditional distribution of the delay given the observed HOL delay. An approximation to its mean value serves as a refined estimator.

The first is the partitioning of server capacity among different customers based on their service time requirements. The second is rush hour demand where a large number of customers arrive over a short period of time followed by few or no arrivals for an extended period thereafter. We study a system with multiple parallel servers and multiple customer classes. The servers can be partitioned into server groups, each dedicated to a single customer class. The system operates under a rush hour regime with a large number of customers arriving at the beginning of the rush hour period. We show that this allows us to reduce the problem to one that is deterministic and for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We compare the performance of the system with and without server partitioning during rush hour and address three basic questions. (1) Is partitioning beneficial to the system? (2) Is it equally beneficial to all customer classes? (3) If it is implemented, what is an optimal partition? We evaluate the applicability of our results to systems where customers arrive over time using (1) deterministic fluid models and (2) simulation models for systems with stochastic interarrival times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0225","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and server partitioning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer to take advantage of alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer is referred to as the option value of second sourcing. On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in second sourcing induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in second sourcing than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of second sourcing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0232","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sourcing strategies and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Yet the theory on the value of component commonality is rather limited in the inventory literature. The existing results were built primarily on single-period models or periodic-review models with zero lead times. In this paper, we consider a continuous-review system with positive lead times. We find that although component commonality is in general beneficial, its value depends strongly on component costs, lead times, and dynamic allocation rules. Under certain conditions, several previous findings based on static models do not hold. In particular, component commonality does not always generate inventory benefits under certain commonly used allocation rules. We provide insight on when component commonality generates inventory benefits and when it may not.

Division of labor is viewed as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of production processes through specialization. At the same time, division of labor also introduces coordination cost as handoffs and communication needs increase. We attempt to empirically assess the net effect in primary care physician offices. We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types. We find evidence supporting both hypotheses. We conclude that many physicians are gaining little financial benefit from delegating work to support staff. This suggests that small practices with few staff may be viable alternatives to traditional practice designs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0236","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the efficiency and profitability of medical office practices through the division of labor without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This can be accomplished in several ways, including online tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pickups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and have the same drivers visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements, together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length, define a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we call the consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal mixed-integer program solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. We provide a technique for generating ConVRP benchmark problems from vehicle routing problem instances given in the literature and provide our solutions to these instances. The solutions produced by our algorithm on all problems do a very good job of meeting customer service objectives with routes that have a low total travel time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0243","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in vehicle routing with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The best-known example is the FASTPASS\u00ae system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0244","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where prices are constant through time and do not differ across ports and prices are constant through time and differ across ports.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results.

Use of the LTD model resulted in a better understanding of the therapeutic needs of the global hemophilia community and helped Bayer make good decisions.

The retailer purchases a single product from the producer and afterward sells it in the retail market at a stochastic clearance price. The retailer, however, is budget constrained and is therefore limited in the number of units that he may purchase from the producer. We also assume that the retailer's profit depends in part on the realized path or terminal value of some observable stochastic process. We interpret this process as a financial process such as a foreign exchange rate or interest rate. More generally, the process can be interpreted as any relevant economic index. We consider a variation (the flexible contract) of the traditional wholesale price contract that is offered by the producer to the retailer. Under this flexible contract, at t = 0 the producer offers a menu of wholesale prices to the retailer, one for each realization of the financial process up to a future time \u03c4. The retailer then commits to purchasing at time \u03c4 a variable number of units, with the specific quantity depending on the realization of the process up to time \u03c4. Because of the retailer's budget constraint, the supply chain might be more profitable if the retailer was able to shift some of the budget from states where the constraint is not binding to states where it is binding. We therefore consider a variation of the flexible contract, where we assume that the retailer is able to trade dynamically between zero and \u03c4 in the financial market. We refer to this variation as the flexible contract with hedging. We compare the decentralized competitive solution for the two contracts with the solutions obtained by a central planner. We also compare the supply chain's performance across the two contracts. We find, for example, that the producer always prefers the flexible contract with hedging to the flexible contract without hedging. Depending on model parameters, however, the retailer might or might not prefer the flexible contract with hedging.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0521","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance and financial contracts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There is a random demand for the firm's capacity in each period: the demand in excess of the capacity is lost, and revenue is generated for the fulfilled demand. At the beginning of each period, the firm might increase its capacity through purchasing equipment for immediate delivery, which is constrained by a random supply limit, or it might sign a future contract for equipment delivery in the following period. We assume that the firm's capacity might partially become obsolete due to natural deterioration or technology innovation. We aim at characterizing optimal capacity expansion strategies and comparing the profit functions as well as the optimal control policies of different options. Specifically, we show that the optimal capacity expansion policy for the current period is determined by a base-stock policy. Compared with the case where no future contracts are available, the optimal control parameters of capacity expansion are always smaller. We further show that when the obsolescence rate is deterministic, the optimal policy for capacity expansion through future contracts is also a base-stock type. The results are extended to the cases with stochastically dependent capacity supply limits and stochastically dependent demand processes, which establish the robustness of the optimal policy in various market conditions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0522","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity expansion and supply chain management without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

They are used in the financial industry as measures of risk and in the service industry as measures of service quality. To manage the quantile of a performance, we need to know how changes in the input parameters affect the output quantiles, which are called quantile sensitivities. In this paper, we show that the quantile sensitivities can be written in the form of conditional expectations. Based on the conditional-expectation form, we first propose an infinitesimal-perturbation-analysis (IPA) estimator. The IPA estimator is asymptotically unbiased, but it is not consistent. We then obtain a consistent estimator by dividing data into batches and averaging the IPA estimates of all batches. The estimator satisfies a central limit theorem for the i.i.d. data, and the rate of convergence is strictly slower than n\u22121/3.

The production system serves multiple classes of customers who require rigid due-date lead times and may cancel their order subject to a cancellation penalty. To meet the due-date constraints, a system manager may outsource orders when the backlog of work is judged excessive, thereby incurring outsourcing costs. The system manager strives to minimize long-run average costs by dynamically making outsourcing and resource allocation decisions. Under heavy-traffic conditions, the scheduling problem is approximated by a Brownian control problem.

The queue is assumed to be invisible to waiting customers, as in most customer contact centers, when contact is made by telephone, e-mail, or instant messaging. Customers who must wait are told upon arrival either the delay of the last customer to enter service or an appropriate average delay. Models for the customer response are proposed. For a rough-cut performance analysis, prior to detailed simulation, two approximations are proposed: (1) the equilibrium delay in a deterministic fluid model, and (2) the equilibrium steady-state delay in a stochastic model with fixed delay announcements. These approximations are shown to be effective in overloaded regimes, where delay announcements are important, by making comparisons with simulations. Within the fluid model framework, conditions are established for the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium delay, where the actual delay coincides with the announced delay. Multiple equilibria can occur if a key monotonicity condition is violated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0533","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and performance analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For example, a manufacturer with a serial production line considers jointly upgrading multiple machines, or a firm producing an assembled product considers improving several components simultaneously. Economies or diseconomies of scope in the fixed cost of adoption when multiple improvements are undertaken at the same time generate an economic dependence among the technological innovations. Although the literature on technological innovations has attributed slow adoption mainly to uncertainties outside the firm, this paper shows that the economic dependence that inherently defines cost relationships inside the firm can significantly influence the timing of adoption. Furthermore, this impact is not unidirectional: economic dependence can either expedite or delay the adoption of an improved technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0534","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of technology adoption and economic dependence without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine a supply chain in which n suppliers sell complementary components to a downstream assembler, who faces a price-sensitive deterministic demand. We analyze alliance/coalition formation between suppliers, using a two-stage approach. In Stage 1, suppliers form coalitions that each agree to sell a kit of components to the assembler. In Stage 2, coalitions make wholesale price decisions, whereas the assembler buys the components (kits) from the coalitions and sets the selling price of the product. Stage 2 is modeled as a competitive game, in which the primary competition is vertical (i.e., supplier coalitions compete against the downstream assembler), and the secondary competition is horizontal, in that coalitions compete against each other. Here, we consider three modes of competition\u2014Supplier Stackelberg, Vertical Nash, and Assembler Stackelberg models\u2014that correspond to different power structures in the market. In Stage 1, we analyze the stability of coalition structures. We assume that suppliers are farsighted, that is, each coalition considers the possibility that once it acts, another coalition may react, and a third coalition might in turn react, and so on. Using this framework, we predict the structure of possible supplier alliances as a function of the power structure in the market, the number of suppliers, and the structure of the demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0536","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier alliances and competitive market structures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Since these networks require enormous investments, network service providers emphasize both survivability and cost effectiveness in their topological design decisions. This paper addresses the survivable network design problem, a core model incorporating the cost and redundancy trade-offs facing network planners. Using a novel connectivity upgrade strategy, we develop several families of inequalities to strengthen a multicommodity flow-based formulation for the problem, and show that some of these inequalities are facet defining. By increasing the linear programming lower bound, the valid inequalities not only lead to better performance guarantees for heuristic solutions, but also accelerate exact and approximate solution methods. We also consider a heuristic strategy that sequentially rounds the fractional values, starting with the linear programming solution to our strong model. Extensive computational tests confirm that the valid inequalities, added via a cutting plane algorithm, and the heuristic procedure are very effective, and their performance is robust to changes in the network dimensions and connectivity structure. Our solution approach generates tight lower and upper bounds with average gaps that are less than 1.2% for various problem sizes and connectivity requirements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0579","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network design and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These routing problems arise from the practice of vendor-managed inventory replenishment and concern the optimal replenishment of a collection of inventory holding locations controlled centrally by a decision maker who is able to monitor inventory levels throughout the network. We develop a notion of location indexability from a Lagrangian relaxation of the problem and show that (subject to mild conditions) the locations are indeed indexable. We thus have a collection of location indices in closed form, namely, real-valued functions of the inventory level (one for each location), which measure in a natural way (namely, as a fair charge for replenishment) each location's priority for inclusion in each day's deliveries. We discuss how to use such location indices to construct heuristics for replenishment and assess a greedy index heuristic in a numerical study where it performs strongly. A simpler approximate index analysis is available for the case in which the demand at each location is Poisson. This analysis permits a more explicit characterisation of the range of holding cost rates for which (approximate) location indexability is guaranteed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0505","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory routing problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or social justice.

Our DMF utilizes a rigorous stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) formulation and incorporates an atmospheric chemistry module to model how ozone concentrations change over time. Within the atmospheric chemistry module, methods from design and analysis of computer experiments are employed to create SDP state transition equation metamodels, and critical dimensionality reduction is conducted to reduce the state-space dimension in solving our SDP problem. Results are presented from a prototype DMF for the Atlanta metropolitan region.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0576","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['ozone', 'pollution', 'control', 'emissions']","The article focuses on developing a decision-making framework for ozone pollution control, which touches on environmental issues but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

In the learning procedure, the company observes the sales history over consecutive learning stages and predicts consumer demand by applying an aggregating algorithm (AA) to a pool of online stochastic predictors. Numerical implementation uses finite-sample distribution approximations that are periodically updated using the most recent sales data. These are subsequently altered with a random step characterizing the stochastic predictors. The company's pricing policy is optimized with a simulation-based procedure integrated with AA. The methodology of the paper is general and independent of specific distributional assumptions. We illustrate this procedure on a demand model for a market in which customers are aware that pricing is dynamic, may time their purchases strategically, and compete for a limited product supply. We derive the form of this demand model using a game-theoretic consumer choice model and study its structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the learning procedure is robust to deviations of the actual market from the model of the market used in learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0577","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A freight forwarder arranges for the execution of many jobs (shipments) on behalf of several clients. Each job consists of a number of sequential activities, such as pickup, truck transportation, warehousing, and air transportation. Each activity can be performed by a number of processing units, such as trucking companies, warehouses, and airlines. If a number of consecutive activities of a job are integrated, i.e., performed by the same processing unit, then it typically costs less. If a number of similar activities of different jobs are consolidated, i.e., performed by the same processing unit, then it also typically costs less. Given a number of jobs and processing units, the sets of activities that can be integrated and consolidated, and the associated costs, the decision problem is to determine which processing unit should perform each activity of each job to minimize the total cost. This problem of assigning shipment activities to processing units is formulated as a linear 0\u20131 program. Principal properties of the model are established. Exploiting the special structure of this model, we design a solution procedure that includes heuristics and a branch-and-bound algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0583","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to cost optimization in air cargo shipments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting no evidence of woke themes."],["2009","57","2","Steven ThompsonSteven Thompsonsthomps3@richmond.eduRobins School of Business, University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia 23173Search for more papers by this author, Manuel NunezManuel Nunezmnunez@business.uconn.eduSchool of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269-1041Search for more papers by this author, Robert GarfinkelRobert Garfinkelrgarfinkel@business.uconn.eduSchool of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269-1041Search for more papers by this author, Matthew D.

This results in quality degradation of patient care due to large delays from admission time to the hospital until arrival at a floor. In addition, there is loss of revenue because of the inability to provide service to potential patients. A solution to the problem is to proactively transfer patients between floors in anticipation of a demand surge. Optimal reallocation poses an extraordinarily complex problem that can be modeled as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on the optimization model, a decision-support system has been developed and implemented at Windham Hospital in Willimantic, Connecticut. Projections from an initial trial period indicate very significant financial gains of about 1% of their total revenue, with no negative impact on any standard quality of care or staffing effectiveness indicators. In addition, the hospital showed a marked improvement in quality of care because of a resulting decrease of almost 50% in the average time that an admitted patient has to wait from admission until being transferred to a floor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0584","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['patient care', 'quality', 'revenue']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and financial gains within a hospital context, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The OCST problem seeks a spanning tree that connects all the nodes and satisfies their communication requirements at a minimum total cost. The paper compares the properties of random trees to the properties of the best solutions for the OCST problem that are found using an evolutionary algorithm. The results show, on average, that the optimal solution and the minimum spanning tree (MST) share a higher number of links than the optimal solution and a random tree. Furthermore, optimal solutions for OCST problems with randomly chosen distance weights share a higher number of links with an MST than OCST problems with Euclidean distance weights. This intuitive similarity between optimal solutions and MSTs suggests that some heuristic optimization methods for OCST problems might be improved by starting with an MST. Using an MST as a starting solution for a greedy search in the tested cases either improves median running time up to a factor of 10 while finding solutions of the same quality, or increases solution quality up to a factor of 100 while using the same number of search steps in comparison to starting the greedy search from a random tree. Starting a local search, a simulated annealing approach and a genetic algorithm from an MST increases solution quality up to a factor of three in comparison to starting from a random solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0592","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of optimization in communication spanning trees without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In such circumstances, it can be expected that profit-maximising participants may engage in implicit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This paper models the emergence of such implicit collusion in a stylised market model using a coevolutionary approach. Players bid supply functions made up of a finite number of linear pieces. Each player uses a genetic algorithm to find state-based strategies depending on the price and demand in the last period and the predicted demand in the next period. We consider a symmetric duopoly and demonstrate that collusive behaviour can be learned even when there is very limited information available to the participants. Moreover, we show a type of implicit collusive behaviour that occurs even though the system does not settle into a stable equilibrium.

Further, we show that the optimal expected system cost is minimized when the ordering times for all stages are synchronized. In contrast to the known approach in the literature that develops a lower bound for the average cost of a given period for the classical serial system, we develop a lower bound for the average total cost over an appropriately defined cycle and then construct a policy that reaches the lower bound.

In such problems, uncertainty arises primarily from forecasts of future supplies and demands for assets at different time epochs. The proposed approach models such uncertainty using intervals about nominal forecast values and a limit on the systemwide scaled deviation from the nominal forecast values. A robust repositioning plan is defined as one in which the typical flow balance constraints and flow bounds are satisfied for the nominal forecast values, and the plan is recoverable under a limited set of recovery actions. A plan is recoverable when feasibility can be reestablished for any outcome in a defined uncertainty set. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for flows to be robust under this definition for three types of allowable recovery actions. When recovery actions allow only flow changes on inventory arcs, we show that the resulting problem is polynomially solvable. When recovery actions allow limited reactive repositioning flows, we develop feasibility conditions that are independent of the size of the uncertainty set.

Moreover, it is commonly accepted that estimation error in the sample mean is much larger than in the sample covariance matrix. For this reason, researchers have recently focused on the minimum-variance portfolio, which relies solely on estimates of the covariance matrix, and thus usually performs better out of sample. However, even the minimum-variance portfolios are quite sensitive to estimation error and have unstable weights that fluctuate substantially over time. In this paper, we propose a class of portfolios that have better stability properties than the traditional minimum-variance portfolios. The proposed portfolios are constructed using certain robust estimators and can be computed by solving a single nonlinear program, where robust estimation and portfolio optimization are performed in a single step. We show analytically that the resulting portfolio weights are less sensitive to changes in the asset-return distribution than those of the traditional portfolios. Moreover, our numerical results on simulated and empirical data confirm that the proposed portfolios are more stable than the traditional minimum-variance portfolios, while preserving (or slightly improving) their relatively good out-of-sample performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0566","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio optimization and estimation error without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2009","57","3","Juan Jos\u00e9 Miranda BrontJuan Jos\u00e9 Miranda Brontjmiranda@dc.uba.arDepartamento de Computaci\u00f3n, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaSearch for more papers by this author, Isabel M\u00e9ndez-D\u00edazIsabel M\u00e9ndez-D\u00edazimendez@dc.uba.arDepartamento de Computaci\u00f3n, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaSearch for more papers by this author, Gustavo VulcanoGustavo Vulcanogvulcano@stern.nyu.eduDepartment of Information, Operations and Management Sciences, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012Search for more papers by this author","A Column Generation Algorithm for Choice-Based Network Revenue Management","During the past few years, there has been a trend to enrich traditional revenue management models built upon the independent demand paradigm by accounting for customer choice behavior.

These define service measures such as what constitutes an acceptable delay or an acceptable abandonment rate. They may also dictate penalties for failing to meet agreed-upon targets. We introduce a period-based SLA that measures performance over a short duration such as a rush hour. We compare it to alternate SLAs that measure service by individual and over a long horizon. To measure the service levels for these SLAs, we develop several approximations. We approximate the probability an acceptable delay is met by generalizing the heavy-traffic quality and efficiency driven regime. We also provide a new approximation for the abandonment rate. Further, we prove a central limit theorem for the probability of meeting a service level measured by the percentage of customers acceptably served during a period. We demonstrate how an outsourced call center operating in an environment with uncertain demand and abandonment can determine its staffing policy to maximize the expected profit for these SLAs. Numerical experiments demonstrate a high degree of accuracy for the approximations and the resulting staffing levels.

Our method is based on relaxing certain constraints that link the decisions for different flight legs by associating Lagrange multipliers with them. In this case, the network revenue management problem decomposes by the flight legs, and we can concentrate on one flight leg at a time. When compared with the so-called deterministic linear program, we show that our method provides a tighter upper bound on the optimal objective value of the network revenue management problem.

In this case, hedging a contingent claim written on the asset is not a trivial matter, and other instruments besides the underlying must be used to hedge in order to provide adequate protection against jump risk. We devise a dynamic hedging strategy that uses a hedge portfolio consisting of the underlying asset and liquidly traded options, where transaction costs are assumed present due to a relative bid-ask spread. At each rebalance time, the hedge weights are chosen to simultaneously (i) eliminate the instantaneous diffusion risk by imposing delta neutrality, and (ii) minimize an objective that is a linear combination of a jump risk and transaction cost penalty function. Because reducing the jump risk is a competing goal vis-\u00e0-vis controlling for transaction cost, the respective components in the objective must be appropriately weighted. Hedging simulations of this procedure are carried out, and our results indicate that the proposed dynamic hedging strategy provides sufficient protection against the diffusion and jump risk while not incurring large transaction costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0598","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial hedging strategies and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

First, we consider that the expected asset returns are stochastic by introducing a probabilistic constraint, which imposes that the expected return of the constructed portfolio must exceed a prescribed return threshold with a high confidence level. We study the deterministic equivalents of these models. In particular, we define under which types of probability distributions the deterministic equivalents are second-order cone programs and give closed-form formulations. Second, we account for real-world trading constraints (such as the need to diversify the investments in a number of industrial sectors, the nonprofitability of holding small positions, and the constraint of buying stocks by lots) modeled with integer variables. To solve the resulting problems, we propose an exact solution approach in which the uncertainty in the estimate of the expected returns and the integer trading restrictions are simultaneously considered. The proposed algorithmic approach rests on a nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm that features two new branching rules. The first one is a static rule, called idiosyncratic risk branching, while the second one is dynamic and is called portfolio risk branching. The two branching rules are implemented and tested using the open-source Bonmin framework. The comparison of the computational results obtained with state-of-the-art MINLP solvers (MINLP_BB and CPLEX) and with our approach shows the effectiveness of the latter, which permits to solve to optimality problems with up to 200 assets in a reasonable amount of time. The practicality of the approach is illustrated through its use for the construction of four fund-of-funds now available on the major trading markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0599","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Neither the distribution \u03c0 nor the support set S are assumed to be available as explicit mathematical equations, but may only be defined through oracles and, in particular, computer programs. This problem commonly occurs in black-box discrete optimization as well as counting and estimation problems. The generality of this setting and high dimensionality of S precludes the application of conventional random variable generation methods. As a result, we turn to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, where we execute an ergodic Markov chain that converges to \u03c0 so that the distribution of the point delivered after sufficiently many steps can be made arbitrarily close to \u03c0. Unfortunately, classical Markov chains, such as the nearest-neighbor random walk or the coordinate direction random walk, fail to converge to \u03c0 because they can get trapped in isolated regions of the support set. To surmount this difficulty, we propose discrete hit-and-run (DHR), a Markov chain motivated by the hit-and-run algorithm known to be the most efficient method for sampling from log-concave distributions over convex bodies in Rn. We prove that the limiting distribution of DHR is \u03c0 as desired, thus enabling us to sample approximately from \u03c0 by delivering the last iterate of a sufficiently large number of iterations of DHR. In addition to this asymptotic analysis, we investigate finite-time behavior of DHR and present a variety of examples where DHR exhibits polynomial performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0600","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in optimization and sampling methods without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

To address this question, we consider a model where two newsvendors sell substitutable products in a market with aggregate market demand D. The two firms get a proportion p and (1 \u2212 p) of this demand, where p is random. We characterize the equilibrium inventory levels of the two firms in a single-period model and show the striking property that, under certain reasonable conditions on the cost parameters, the two firms ignore their competitor's inventory levels and potential substitution demand, i.e., their inventory decisions are decoupled. Furthermore, we show under slightly more restrictive conditions on the cost parameters that the single-period results can be extended to the case where D is random. Finally, we extend the decoupling property to a multiperiod periodic review scenario and show that the resulting Nash equilibrium can be characterized simply as the solution to a single-product dynamic newsvendor problem that ignores substitution demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0601","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory competition without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

To obtain good space-filling properties, the maximin criterion is frequently used. Unfortunately, constructing maximin LHDs can be quite time consuming when the number of dimensions and design points increase. In these cases, we can use heuristical maximin LHDs. In this paper, we construct bounds for the separation distance of certain classes of maximin LHDs. These bounds are useful for assessing the quality of heuristical maximin LHDs. Until now only upper bounds are known for the separation distance of certain classes of unrestricted maximin designs, i.e., for maximin designs without a Latin hypercube structure. The separation distance of maximin LHDs also satisfies these \u201cunrestricted\u201d bounds. By using some of the special properties of LHDs, we are able to find new and tighter bounds for maximin LHDs. Within the different methods used to determine the upper bounds, a variety of combinatorial optimization techniques are employed. Mixed-integer programming, the traveling salesman problem, and the graph-covering problem are among the formulations used to obtain the bounds. Besides these bounds, also a construction method is described for generating LHDs that meet Baer's bound for the \u2113\u221e distance measure for certain values of n.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0604","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Latin hypercube designs and combinatorial optimization without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

We provide recommended policies for convex, concave, and convex-concave lead-time cost functions and prove that these policies are asymptotically optimal.

There are multiple product types, corresponding to multiple classes of demand, and the firm purchases capacity of each product before the first period. Within each period, after demand arrives, products are allocated to customers. Customers who arrive to find that their product has been depleted can be upgraded by at most one level. We show that the optimal allocation policy is a simple two-step algorithm: First, use any available capacity to satisfy same-class demand, and then upgrade customers until capacity reaches a protection limit, so that in the second step the higher-level capacity is rationed. We show that these results hold both when all capacity is salvaged at the end of the last demand period as well as when capacity can be replenished (in the latter case, an order-up-to policy is optimal for replenishment). Although finding the optimal protection limits is computationally intensive, we describe bounds for the optimal protection limits that take little effort to compute and can be used to effectively solve large problems. Using these heuristics, we examine numerically the relative value of strictly optimal capacity and dynamic rationing, the value of perfect demand information, and the impact of demand and economic parameters on the value of optimal substitution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0610","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for capacity allocation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Should we buy now or wait and gather more information? In this paper, we study a dynamic programming model of this technology adoption problem. In each period, the consumer decides whether to adopt the technology, reject it, or wait and gather additional information by observing a signal about the technology's benefit. The technology's actual benefit may be constant or changing stochastically over time. The dynamic programming state variable is a probability distribution that describes the consumer's beliefs about the benefits of the technology. We allow general probability distributions on benefits and general signal processes and assume that the consumer updates her beliefs over time using Bayes' rule. We are interested in structural properties of this model. We show that improving the technology's benefit need not make the consumer better off and that first-order stochastic dominance improvements in the consumer's distribution on benefits need not increase the consumer's value function. Nevertheless, the model possesses a great deal of structure. For example, we obtain monotonic value functions and policies if we order distributions using likelihood-ratio dominance rather than first-order stochastic dominance.

A fixed cost is incurred whenever a delivery request is made, regardless of the quantity ordered later. The new feature of this research relative to previous work is the separation of the delivery request and the quantity decision, or the postponement of ordering until one-period demand information is observed. Due to such separation, both the state space and the action space must be augmented in the model. We show that the optimal policy for delivery requests is of a threshold type: A delivery request is made if and only if the inventory on hand is below a threshold. The optimal decision on ordering is more complex, and there might be multiple order-up-to levels. Our numerical studies show, nonetheless, that the cost of an ordering policy that considers (at most) two order-up-to levels is close to the minimal when the planning horizon is not too short. We also identify conditions under which a base-stock policy is optimal for ordering. To understand the effects of ordering postponement, we compare our model with the traditional model in which the two decisions must be made at the same time. We show that postponement leads not only to a lower cost, but also a higher threshold for making delivery requests.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0696","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast to earlier two-stage approaches, the multistage model allows for revision of the capacity expansion plan as more information regarding the uncertainties is revealed. We provide analytical bounds for the value of multistage stochastic programming (VMS) afforded over the two-stage approach. By exploiting a special substructure inherent in the problem, we develop an efficient approximation scheme for the difficult multistage stochastic integer program and prove that the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal. Computational experiments with realistic-scale problem instances suggest that the VMS for this class of problems is quite high; moreover, the quality and performance of the approximation scheme is very satisfactory. Fortunately, this is more so for instances for which the VMS is high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0623","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of capacity planning and stochastic programming without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2009","57","4","K.

Queue-length information is available to inform all decisions. Admitted customers will abandon the system if required to wait too long for service. The optimisation goal is the maximisation of reward rate earned from service completions, net of the penalties paid whenever admission is denied, and the costs incurred upon every customer loss through impatience. We show that the system is indexable under mild conditions on model parameters and give an explicit construction of an index policy for admission control and routing founded on a proposal of Whittle for restless bandits. We are able to gain insights regarding the strength of performance of the index policy from the nature of solutions to the Lagrangian relaxation used to develop the indices. These insights are strengthened by the development of performance bounds. Although we are able to assert the optimality of the index heuristic in a range of asymptotic regimes, the performance bounds are also able to identify instances where its performance is relatively weak.

We describe many different types of preferences that can be modeled using a matrix bid, which is quite flexible, supporting additive, subadditive, and superadditive preferences simultaneously. To utilize the compactness of the matrix bid format in a more general preference environment, we describe a logical language with matrix bids as \u201catoms\u201d and show that matrix bids compactly express preferences that require an exponential number of atoms in other bidding languages and are as expressive as the most sophisticated languages in the literature.

We study the efficiency guarantees that are possible when we restrict to mechanisms that satisfy certain scalability constraints motivated by large-scale communication networks; in particular, we restrict attention to mechanisms where users are restricted to one-dimensional strategy spaces. We first study the efficiency guarantees possible when the mechanism is not allowed to price differentiate. We study the worst-case efficiency loss (ratio of the utility associated with a Nash equilibrium to the maximum possible utility), and show that Kelly's proportional allocation mechanism minimizes the efficiency loss when users are price anticipating. We then turn our attention to mechanisms where price differentiation is permitted; using an adaptation of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves class of mechanisms, we construct a class of mechanisms with one-dimensional strategy spaces where Nash equilibria are fully efficient. These mechanisms are shown to be fully efficient even in general convex environments, under reasonable assumptions. Our results highlight a fundamental insight in mechanism design: when the pricing flexibility available to the mechanism designer is limited, restricting the strategic flexibility of bidders may actually improve the efficiency guarantee.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0638","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and efficiency without addressing any social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

A multiname credit derivative is a financial security that allows the investor to transfer this risk to the credit market. In this paper, we study the valuation and risk analysis of multiname derivatives. To capture the complex economic phenomena that drive the pricing of these securities, we introduce a time-changed birth process as a probabilistic model of correlated event timing. The self-exciting property of a time-changed birth process captures the feedback from events that is often observed in credit markets. The stochastic variation of arrival rates between events captures the exposure of firms to common economic risk factors. We derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of a time-changed birth process, and develop analytically tractable pricing relations for a range of multiname derivatives valuation problems.

The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i.e., the contract payment plus qualification costs. Although suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (prequalification), we allow the manufacturer to delay all or part of the qualification until after the auction (postqualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis, we analytically explore the trade-offs between varying levels of pre- and postqualification.

For example, patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) require dialysis three times a week. These patients are also frequently hospitalized for complications from their treatment, resulting in idle capacity at the clinic. These temporary patient absences make overbooking at the clinic attractive. This paper develops a semiclosed migration network to capture patient flow into the clinic and between the clinic and hospital. We consider a simple class of stationary control policies for patient admissions and provide algorithms for selecting one that maximizes long-run average earnings. Local diffusion approximations were constructed to provide square-root loading formulas for the optimal capacity level and patient overbooking level: as the total patient arrival rate increases, the deviation between the optimal and fluid-limit capacity and overbooking levels scale up with the square root of the total arrival rate. We find that high hospitalization rates and long inpatient stays allow for more overbooking. Numerical examples based on the typical dialysis clinic in the United States suggest an increase in earnings of 11%\u201314% over policies derived from traditional M/M/N models that do not account for hospitalizations and do not allow overbooking, while keeping the probability of capacity shortage arbitrarily small.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0666","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['chronic conditions', 'patients', 'treatment']","The article focuses primarily on optimizing operational efficiency and profitability in healthcare settings without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Motivated by the failure of independent and identically distributed random variables to represent such input processes, a comprehensive framework called Vector-Autoregressive-To-Anything (VARTA) has been introduced for multivariate time-series input modeling. Despite its flexibility in capturing a wide variety of distributional shapes, we show that VARTA falls short in representing dependence structures that arise in situations where extreme component realizations occur together. We demonstrate that it is possible to extend VARTA to work for such dependence structures via the use of the copula theory, which has been used primarily for random vectors in the simulation input-modeling literature, for multivariate time-series input modeling. We show that our copula-based multivariate time-series input model, which includes VARTA as a special case, allows the development of statistically valid fitting and fast sampling algorithms well suited for driving large-scale stochastic simulations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0669","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic simulation and input modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For standard graphs, these measures can be computed efficiently using network flow techniques. However, in the Internet on the level of autonomous systems (ASs), referred to as AS-level Internet, routing policies impose restrictions on the paths that traffic can take in the network. These restrictions can be captured by the valley-free path model, which assumes a special directed graph model in which edge types represent relationships between ASs. We consider the adaptation of the classical connectivity measures to the valley-free path model, where it is \ud835\udca9\ud835\udcab-hard to compute them. Our first main contribution consists of presenting algorithms for the computation of disjoint paths, and minimum cuts, in the valley-free path model. These algorithms are useful for ASs that want to evaluate different options for selecting upstream providers to improve the robustness of their connection to the Internet. Our second main contribution is an experimental evaluation of our algorithms on four types of directed graph models of the AS-level Internet produced by different inference algorithms. Most importantly, the evaluation shows that our algorithms are able to compute optimal solutions to instances of realistic size of the connectivity problems in the valley-free path model in reasonable time. Furthermore, our experimental results provide information about the characteristics of the directed graph models of the AS-level Internet produced by different inference algorithms. It turns out that (i) we can quantify the difference between the undirected AS-level topology and the directed graph models with respect to fundamental connectivity measures, and (ii) the different inference algorithms yield topologies that are similar with respect to connectivity and are different with respect to the types of paths that exist between pairs of ASs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0677","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network connectivity and algorithmic solutions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that for problems with equal insertion lengths and break durations, the worst-case bound on the performance of the proposed algorithm increases with the number of program breaks and the number of insertions per break, and that it is independent of the number of conflicts between pairs of insertions. Simulation results suggest that the algorithm performs well even if the problem size is small.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0635","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to scheduling television commercials without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2009","57","5","James LuedtkeJames Luedtkejrluedt1@wisc.eduDepartment of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706Search for more papers by this author, George L.

The technology improves over time, so that a decision maker has incentive to delay starting an activity to take advantage of better technology and lower operational costs. The model captures the fundamental trade-off between delaying the start time of an activity and the need for some activities to be performed now. Models of this type are used in the oil industry to plan the development of oil fields. This problem is naturally formulated as a mixed-integer program with a bilinear objective. We develop a series of progressively more compact mixed-integer linear formulations, along with classes of valid inequalities that make the formulations strong. We also present a specialized branch-and-cut algorithm to solve an extremely compact concave formulation. Computational results indicate that these formulations can be used to solve large-scale instances, whereas a straightforward linearization of the mixed-integer bilinear formulation fails to solve even small instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0649","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for strategic planning in supply networks without any mention of social themes, ethics, or DEI.

We focus on the preemptive-repeat discipline, under which a machine breakdown leads to the loss of the work done on the job being processed. The breakdown process of the machine is allowed to depend on the job it is processing. The processing times required to complete the jobs, and the machine uptimes and downtimes, are random variables with incomplete information on their probability distributions characterized by unknown parameters. We establish the preemptive-repeat model with incomplete information and investigate its probabilistic characteristics. We show that optimal static policies can be obtained for a wide range of performance measures, which are determined by the prior distributions of the unknown parameters. We derive optimal dynamic policies via Gittins indices represented by the posterior distributions, which are updated adaptively based on processing histories. Under appropriate conditions, the optimal dynamic policies can be calculated by one-step reward rates in a closed form. As a by-product, we also show that our incomplete information model subsumes the traditional preemptive-repeat models with complete information as extreme cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0660","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and machine breakdowns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A scenario tree represents uncertainty in the model; a general mixed-integer program defines the operational submodel at each scenario-tree node, and capacity-expansion decisions link the stages. We apply \u201cvariable splitting\u201d to two model variants, and solve those variants using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. The Dantzig-Wolfe master problem can have a much stronger linear programming relaxation than is possible without variable splitting, over 700% stronger in one case. The master problem solves easily and tends to yield integer solutions, obviating the need for a full branch-and-price solution procedure. For each scenario-tree node, the decomposition defines a subproblem that may be viewed as a single-period, deterministic, capacity-planning problem. An effective solution procedure results as long as the subproblems solve efficiently, and the procedure incorporates a good \u201cduals stabilization method.\u201d We present computational results for a model to plan the capacity expansion of an electricity distribution network in New Zealand, given uncertain future demand.

Exemplary of this approach are the Aravind Eye Hospitals in India, where profitable paying hospitals are used to subsidize care at free hospitals. We model this problem as a multiperiod stochastic dynamic program. In each period, the organization must decide how much of the current assets should be invested in revenue-customer service capacity, and at what price the service should be sold. We provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal capacity and pricing decisions are of threshold type. Similar results are derived when the selling price is fixed, but the banking of assets from one period to the next is allowed.

For several multistage strategies, we solve the Stackelberg game in which the U.S. Government chooses the biometric threshold levels to maximize the detection probability subject to constraints on the false positive probability and on the mean time per visitor to perform biometric screening, and the terrorist chooses the fingerprint image quality to minimize his detection probability. The first stage of all the strategies uses the current minutiae-based fingerprint matching system, but with thresholds that depend on image quality, which in isolation achieves a detection probability of 0.771. Using face recognition (based on 2002 data) in the second stage increases the detection probability to 0.841, whereas using a slower and more thorough texture-based fingerprint matcher in the second stage leads to a detection probability of at least 0.913 and perhaps significantly higher. (Data for the texture matcher is only available for the poorest-quality prints and we assume that this is its performance for all prints.) Adding face recognition as a third stage to this latter system does not improve performance. The two-finger, two-stage strategy may be comparable in performance to the ten-finger, single-stage strategy (which has a detection probability of 0.937), is robust against gaming and poor image acquisition, requires no additional hardware, and would generate no visible changes from the original two-finger, single-stage system from a visitor's viewpoint.

In such an environment, the buyer installs dedicated production capacity at the suppliers before demand is realized. Final production orders are decided after demand materializes. Of course, the buyer is reluctant to bear all the capacity and inventory risk, and thus signs flexible contracts with several suppliers. We model the suppliers' offers as option contracts, where each supplier charges a reservation price per unit of capacity and an execution price per unit of delivered supply. These two parameters illustrate the trade-off between total price and flexibility of a contract, which are both important to the buyer. We model the interaction between suppliers and the buyer as a game in which the suppliers are the leaders and the buyer is the follower. Specifically, suppliers compete to provide supply capacity to the buyer, and the buyer optimizes its expected profit by selecting one or more suppliers. We characterize the suppliers' equilibria in pure strategies for a class of customer demand distributions. In particular, we show that this type of interaction gives rise to cluster competition. That is, in equilibrium suppliers tend to be clustered in small groups of two or three suppliers each, such that within the same group all suppliers use similar technologies and offer the same type of contract. Finally, we show that in equilibrium, supply chain inefficiencies\u2014i.e., the loss of profit due to competition\u2014are at most 25% of the profit of a centralized supply chain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0735","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for procurement and supply chain dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Realized demand is observed over time, but the underlying functional relationship between price and mean demand rate that governs these observations (otherwise known as the demand function or demand curve) is not known. We consider two instances of this problem: (i) a setting where the demand function is assumed to belong to a known parametric family with unknown parameter values; and (ii) a setting where the demand function is assumed to belong to a broad class of functions that need not admit any parametric representation. In each case we develop policies that learn the demand function \u201con the fly,\u201d and optimize prices based on that. The performance of these algorithms is measured in terms of the regret: the revenue loss relative to the maximal revenues that can be extracted when the demand function is known prior to the start of the selling season. We derive lower bounds on the regret that hold for any admissible pricing policy, and then show that our proposed algorithms achieve a regret that is \u201cclose\u201d to this lower bound. The magnitude of the regret can be interpreted as the economic value of prior knowledge on the demand function, manifested as the revenue loss due to model uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0640","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical revenue management problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our approach relies on decision maker risk preferences. Specifically, we utilize the theory of coherent risk measures initiated by Artzner et al. (1999) [Artzner, P., F. Delbaen, J. Eber, D. Heath. 1999. Coherent measures of risk. Math. Finance9 203\u2013228.], and show that such risk measures, in conjunction with the support of the uncertain parameters, are equivalent to explicit uncertainty sets for robust optimization. We explore the structure of these sets in detail. In particular, we study a class of coherent risk measures, called distortion risk measures, which give rise to polyhedral uncertainty sets of a special structure that is tractable in the context of robust optimization. In the case of discrete distributions with rational probabilities, which is useful in practical settings when we are sampling from data, we show that the class of all distortion risk measures (and their corresponding polyhedral sets) are generated by a finite number of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measures. A subclass of the distortion risk measures corresponds to polyhedral uncertainty sets symmetric through the sample mean. We show that this subclass is also finitely generated and can be used to find inner approximations to arbitrary, polyhedral uncertainty sets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0646","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of robust optimization and decision-making under uncertainty without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We consider a third dimension\u2014in addition to time and inventory level\u2014that the firms can use in setting their prices: the information that the firm has at the individual customer level. An arriving customer provides a signal to the firm, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's willingness to pay, and the firm makes a personalized price offer depending on the signal, inventory level, and time. We consider two different models: full personalization and partial personalization. In the full personalization model, the firm charges any price it wishes given the customer signal, while in the partial personalization model, the firm can charge one of two prices. We find that a mere correlation between the signals and customers' willingness to pay is not sufficient to ensure intuitive relationships between the signal and the optimal prices. We determine a stronger condition, which leads to several structural properties, including the monotonicity of the optimal price with respect to the signal in the full personalization model. For the partial personalization model, we show that the optimal pricing policy is of threshold-type and that the threshold is monotonic in the inventory level and time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0701","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a simple model, we show that (i) the end-of-period scheme results in higher than optimal order-up-to levels and inventory cost if the cost and demand parameters are unchanged, and (ii) it is possible to replicate both the optimal base-stock level and its cost by selecting the values of the cost or demand parameters judiciously. The cost adjustments often require extreme values, and no systematic cost parameter adjustment scheme is robust. However, we find a systematic adjustment to the demand parameters that serves as a good approximation and is robust. We therefore conclude that end-of-period cost accounting without parameter adjustments is in general inappropriate when costs are incurred continuously, but there are adjustments that can make it work well.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0752","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because drug stockpiles are presently scattered in different countries, the outbreak of an epidemic gives rise to a game in which each country must make decisions about how best to allocate its own stockpile in order to protect its population. We develop a two-period multivariate Reed-Frost model to represent the spread of the epidemic within and across countries at its onset. We consider the first two periods only to mimic the exponential growth of an epidemic in its early stage, while keeping the model tractable. Preliminary numerical studies suggest that insights from the two-period model hold in general when considering the entire time horizon. Our model captures three critical sources of uncertainty: the number of initial infections, the spread of the disease, and drug efficacy. We show that for small probabilities of between-country infections, the underlying game is supermodular, Nash equilibrium exists, and there is a unique one that is Pareto optimal among all existing equilibria. Further, we identify sufficient conditions under which the optimal solution of a central planner (such as the World Health Organization) constitutes a Pareto improvement over the decentralized equilibrium, suggesting that countries should agree on an allocation scheme that would benefit everyone. By contrast, when the central planner's solution does not constitute a Pareto improvement, minimizing the total number of infected persons globally requires some countries to sacrifice part of their own population, which raises intriguing ethical issues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1090.0762","","OR","Multidisciplinary","6","['ethical issues', 'allocation scheme', 'Pareto improvement']","The article discusses ethical issues related to drug allocation during a pandemic, emphasizing the need for equitable solutions that benefit all countries.

We examine two related research questions: (1) What are the organizational implications of pursuing multiple performance goals? (2) Are local and myopic (as opposed to global) goal prioritization strategies effective in dealing with multiple goals? We employ a series of computational experiments to examine these questions. Our results from these experiments both formalize the intuition behind existing wisdom and provide new insights. We show that imposing a multitude of weakly correlated performance measures on even simple organizations (i.e., an organization comprised of independent employees) leads to a performance freeze in that actors are not able to identify choices that enhance organizational performance across the full array of goals. This problem increases as the degree of interdependence of organizational action increases. We also find that goal myopia, spatial differentiation of performance goals, and temporal differentiation of performance goals help rescue organizations from this status quo trap. In addition to highlighting a new class of organizational problems, we argue that in a world of boundedly rational actors, incomplete guides to action in the sense of providing only a subset of underlying goals prove more effective at directing and coordinating behavior than more complete representations of underlying objectives. Management, in the form of the articulation of a subset of goals, provides a degree of clarity and focus in a complex world.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0358","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['performance goals', 'organizational implications', 'boundedly rational actors']","The article discusses the complexities of managing multiple performance goals within organizations, which touches on organizational effectiveness but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

In this paper, I argue that firms with a wide scope of experience have superior absorptive capacity for dealing with heterogeneous information; hence, such firms will be able to extract performance improvements from network positions rich in structural holes. Furthermore, firms with a high level of historic multimarket contact (MMC) with their partners are able to reduce the risks of partner noncooperation, hence augmenting their performance compared to firms in open networks that do not enjoy MMC with their own partners. Finally, firms of low centrality in the industry's network of alliances will extract performance benefits from enhancing bargaining power as a result of exploiting brokerage opportunities in open networks.

However, scholars have yet to advance a theoretically consistent definition or comprehensive theory of organizational stigma. The purpose of this paper is to define the construct of organizational stigma and provide a general theory that explains the conditions under which organizational stigmas are likely to arise, how this process unfolds, and the initial effects stigmas inflict on organizations. In doing so, we distinguish organizational stigma from both individual-level stigma and the organizational-level constructs of reputation, status, celebrity, and legitimacy. We then build upon multiple streams of research to develop a richer theoretical explanation of the roles social context, social processes, and social actors play in the origination and effects of an organizational stigma.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0367","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['stigma', 'social context', 'social processes', 'social actors']","The article discusses organizational stigma and its social implications, indicating a moderate focus on social issues.

The literature recognizes that established risk planning methods are very powerful when the nature of risks is well understood, but that they are insufficient for managing unforeseeable uncertainty. For this case, two fundamental approaches have been identified: trial-and-error learning, or actively searching for information and repeatedly changing the goals and course of action as new information emerges, and selectionism, or pursuing several approaches in parallel to see ex post what works best. Based on a sample of 58 startups in Shanghai, we test predictions from prior literature on the circumstances under which selectionism or trial-and-error learning leads to higher performance. We find that the best approach depends on a combination of uncertainty and complexity of the startup: risk planning is sufficient when both are low; trial-and-error learning promises the highest potential when unforeseeable uncertainty is high, and selectionism is preferred when both unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity are high, provided that the choice of the best trial can be delayed until its true market performance can be assessed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0369","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on risk management and performance in startups without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Innovation requires the coordinated efforts of many actors to facilitate (1) the recombination of ideas to generate novelty, (2) real-time problem solving, and (3) linkages between present innovation efforts with past experiences and future aspirations. We propose that innovation narratives are cultural mechanisms that address these coordination requirements by enabling translation. Specifically, innovation narratives are powerful mechanisms for translating ideas across the organization so that they are comprehensible and appear legitimate to others. Narratives also enable people to translate emergent situations that are ambiguous or equivocal so as to promote real-time problem solving.

Resource variation, represented by amplitude, frequency, and unpredictability of change in market demand, has been shown to affect organizations' decisions and life chances, but there is little evidence of the effect of variation on entry decisions. We hypothesize that resource variation in a market reduces entry but that not all firms are equally deterred by variation. In particular, firm experience with entry in general and with the target market specifically moderate the overall effect of market variation on entry. Our analysis of foreign market entry by U.S. telecommunications firms from 1985 to 2000 indicates that variation does deter entry and that experience moderates this effect, though not all dimensions of variation have significant effects.

Human resource management (HRM) activities, on the other hand, assume strategic significance by supporting the three cases above through a process that we call managerial entrepreneurship. Furthermore, HRM takes on different forms when supporting each of these types of rents.

To document the existence of diseconomies of managing in acquisitions, we examine the change in civil lawsuit judgments involving acquired firms pre- and postacquisition. Civil lawsuit judgments can capture breakdowns in management oversight that cause firms to take actions that a prudent firm would not take or fail to take actions that a prudent firm would take.

Findings support the role of this form of leadership in dispersed settings. Inspirational leadership emerged as a significant predictor of individuals' trust in team members and commitment to the team. Further, the positive relationship between inspirational leadership and individuals' commitment to the team and trust in team members was strengthened in teams that were more dispersed suggesting that inspirational leaders are important in all contexts but that their importance is underscored in highly dispersed contexts.

We provide new insights based on an event study of the returns to 34 corporate investors from acquiring 242 technology startups. Consistent with predictions drawn from the absorptive capacity literature, we find that the effect of CVC investing on acquisition performance hinges critically on the strength of the acquirer's internal knowledge base: as CVC investments increase relative to an acquirer's total R&D expenditures, acquisition performance improves at a diminishing rate. We also find that firms consistently engaged in venture financing earn greater returns when acquiring startups than do firms with more sporadic patterns of investing, even controlling for firm profitability, size, and acquisition experience. These findings suggest that corporate investors systematically differ in their abilities to derive added benefits from external venturing as acquirers of entrepreneurial firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0386","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate venture capital and its impact on firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Managerial cognition is important in understanding organizational outcomes, and considering both the direction of cognition and its interaction with organizational factors provides a more nuanced view of entry behavior.

Large bodies of research have examined the behavioral, social, and cognitive forces that underlie this phenomenon; however, the role of an organization's identity remains relatively unexplored. Identity comprises insider and outsider perceptions of what is core about an organization. An identity has associated with it a set of norms that represent shared beliefs about legitimate behavior for an organization with that identity. In this paper, technologies that deviate from the expectations associated with an organization's identity are labeled identity-challenging technologies. Based on a comprehensive field-based case study of the entire life history of a company, identity-challenging technologies are found to be difficult to capitalize on for two reasons. First, identity serves as a filter, such that organizational members notice and interpret external stimuli in a manner consistent with the identity. As a result, identity-challenging technological opportunities may be missed. Second, because identity becomes intertwined in the routines, procedures, and beliefs of both organizational and external constituents, explicit efforts to shift identity in order to accommodate identity-challenging technology are difficult. Given the disruptive nature of identity shifts, understanding whether technology is identity challenging is a critical consideration for managers pursuing new technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0419","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['identity', 'technology', 'norms']","The article discusses the concept of organizational identity and its impact on technology adoption, which touches on social dynamics within organizations.

We show that compensatory fit can only work when there is a powerful informal organization already in existence, and when the gains from ambidexterity are substantial. Further, depending on the strength of the informal organization, breakdown in the conditions necessary for compensatory fit may lead to performance declines and further reorganizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0421","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['informal organization', 'employee behavior', 'reorganization']","The article discusses the dynamics between formal and informal organizations and their impact on employee behavior, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The focus is on the determinants of a company's choice to outsource research projects to academic organizations. Because of the different institutional missions of academic organizations, outsourcing a project to a university allows a firm to commit not to terminate or alter a scientifically valuable project before it is complete. This commitment is potentially valuable for the firm in an environment where scientific value and economic value may not coincide, and scientific workers are responsive to the incentives defined by their community of peers. An economic model that formalizes these arguments is developed. Empirical hypotheses are then formulated about the kind of research activities firms will outsource to universities and activities on which they will exert stronger control. Evidence from a sample of industry-university research agreements, as well as from other large-sample and case studies, shows patterns consistent with the predictions of the model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0366","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['commitment', 'collaborative research', 'scientific value']","The article discusses the dynamics of outsourcing research to academic institutions, focusing on the balance between scientific and economic value.

Deception as Identity Preservation Among Jazz Record Companies, 1920\u20131929","This paper theoretically and empirically engages the relationship between organizational identity and deception using the market for early jazz recordings as a setting. In this setting, pseudonyms (where a recording is reissued under a fictitious name) were used deceptively as a way to preserve a firm's identity while selling profitable but identity-threatening products to the mass market. Firms founded in the Victorian Era actively sought alignment with the cultural elite and used pseudonyms to deceive observers into believing that their production of cultural products was consistent with their Victorian Era identity. In effect, pseudonyms allowed these firms to decouple their position in identity space from their position in product space by inflating production of identity-preserving products. Using product data from jazz discographies, record company directories, and record advertisements in major U.S. newspapers, we provide strong empirical evidence that Victorian Era firms were active in using pseudonyms to preserve their identities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0371","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['deception', 'identity', 'cultural products']","The article discusses organizational identity and deception but does not engage with socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

Instead, we found that ventures are temporary conduits for capability development and play a primary role in launching the founding stage of new capability life cycles. Ventures' main contribution was often to transfer valuable capabilities to other ventures or the firm's existing business units. The benefit from investing in ventures was therefore largely independent of their commercial success. Furthermore, estimation of success rates proved highly sensitive to the stage of the ventures at which sampling began. These findings suggest the need to reconceptualize the notion of early stage ventures and their success. We further found that the venturing process can be conceptualized as a nested system of simultaneous selection at both the venture and the capability level.

Our findings suggest that pre-entry knowledge and management experience increase firm survival through moderating the effects of these subsequent learning activities. We also find that learning activities are not always beneficial; in our sample, early-stage business planning is associated with decreased firm survival, and product line change is associated with increased firm survival. We examine these patterns using survey data collected from 436 individuals in the Munich region who founded their own firms as an alternative to continued unemployment.

Our study of over 7,300 scientific publications by 177 research scientists working with more than 14,000 others over an 11-year period provides evidence that the relationship between a research scientist's professional network and knowledge creation depends on both ego network density and average tie strength.

Using data from 235 firms, we find that these three processes have a positive effect on a firm's alliance portfolio capital, and some of these effects are conditioned by a formal alliance function and diversity of the portfolio. Whereas the ability of proactive formation and relational governance processes to create value is further strengthened in the presence of an alliance function, that of the coordination dimension is weakened. Furthermore, the benefits of relational governance are strengthened for firms with diverse portfolios, whereas the benefits of coordination processes are weakened. We discuss implications of these findings for the alliance and network literature, and in general, for firm heterogeneity.

Ambidextrous organizations excel at exploiting existing products to enable incremental innovation and at exploring new opportunities to foster more radical innovation, yet related research is limited. Largely conceptual, anecdotal, or single case studies offer architectural or contextual approaches. Architectural ambidexterity proposes dual structures and strategies to differentiate efforts, focusing actors on one or the other form of innovation. In contrast, contextual approaches use behavioral and social means to integrate exploitation and exploration. To develop a more comprehensive model, we sought to learn from five, ambidextrous firms that lead the product design industry. Results offer an alternative framework for examining exploitation-exploration tensions and their management. More specifically, we present nested paradoxes of innovation: strategic intent (profit-breakthroughs), customer orientation (tight-loose coupling), and personal drivers (discipline-passion). Building from innovation and paradox literature, we theorize how integration and differentiation tactics help manage these interwoven paradoxes and fuel virtuous cycles of ambidexterity.

Structural differentiation can help ambidextrous organizations to maintain multiple inconsistent and conflicting demands; however, differentiated exploratory and exploitative activities need to be mobilized, coordinated, integrated, and applied. Based on this idea, we delineate formal and informal senior team integration mechanisms (e.g., contingency rewards and social integration) and formal and informal organizational integration mechanisms (e.g., cross-functional interfaces and connectedness) and examine how they mediate the relationship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity. Overall, our findings suggest that the previously asserted direct effect of structural differentiation on ambidexterity operates through informal senior team (i.e., senior team social integration) and formal organizational (i.e., cross-functional interfaces) integration mechanisms. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment, we contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding of how organizations may effectively pursue exploration and exploitation simultaneously to achieve ambidexterity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0415","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['integration', 'exploration', 'exploitation']","The article focuses on structural attributes and organizational mechanisms without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, which are central to 'woke' themes.

We unpack this construct into one with two dimensions we term the balance dimension of ambidexterity (BD) and the combined dimension of ambidexterity (CD). BD corresponds to a firm's orientation to maintain a close relative balance between exploratory and exploitative activities, whereas CD corresponds to their combined magnitude. We reason that these dimensions are conceptually distinct, and rely on different causal mechanisms to enhance firm performance. We find that over and above their independent effects, concurrent high levels of BD and CD yield synergistic benefits. We also find that BD is more beneficial to resource-constrained firms, whereas CD is more beneficial to firms having greater access to internal and/or external resources. These results indicate that managers in resource-constrained contexts may benefit from a focus on managing trade-offs between exploration and exploitation demands, but for firms that have access to sufficient resources, the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation is both possible and desirable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0426","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational ambidexterity and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To successfully navigate a technological transition, firms often face the ambidextrous challenge of \u201cexploiting\u201d existing complementary assets to support the new \u201cexploratory\u201d core technology. We argue that an industry incumbent attempting to make a transition to a new technology requires linkages between organizational units responsible for developing the new technology and units in charge of complementary assets needed to commercialize the innovation. These linkages are critical but overlooked elements of organizational ambidexterity. This paper develops a conceptual framework in which the ability to build and leverage organizational linkages involving the new technology and its complementary assets is essential for a successful technological transition. The framework also highlights the importance of middle management in creating and maintaining these linkages, which are critical to dynamic capabilities in technological transitions. We identify four critical influences\u2014economic, structural, social, and cognitive\u2014on managerial linking activity that enable firms to transition to a new technology while utilizing valuable preexisting capabilities.

We find that stars hired to explore (initiate new activities) experience a short- and long-term performance decline; by contrast, stars who join new firms to exploit (reinforce existing activities) suffer only a short-term drop in performance. Stars hired in exploration roles can preserve some of their performance by moving with a group of colleagues from the originating firm. Investors view the hiring of a star analyst as value-destroying for the hiring firm regardless of whether the firm is hiring to exploit or explore, but the negative reactions are economically more extreme for exploration hires. These findings indicate that, even at the individual level, probabilities of success in exploration activities are lower than in exploitation activities, thereby reinforcing the tendency toward exploitation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0430","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['performance', 'exploration', 'exploitation']","The article primarily focuses on performance metrics related to hiring practices in professional service firms, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The collapse occurred as the museum was preparing for another rare event: the Fair of the Iron Horse, an event planned to celebrate the 175th anniversary of American railroading. Our analysis of these rare events, grounded in data collected through interviews and archival materials, reveals that the issue is not so much what organizations learn \u201cfrom\u201d rare events but what they learn \u201cthrough\u201d rare events. Rare events are interruptions that trigger learning because they expose weaknesses and reveal unrealized behavioral potential. Moreover, we find that three organizing routines\u2014interpreting, relating, and re-structuring\u2014are strengthened and broadened across a series of interruptions. These organizing routines are critical to both learning and responding because they update understanding and reduce the ambiguity generated during a rare event. Ultimately, rare events provoke a reconsideration of organizational identity as the organization learns what it knows and who it is when it sees what it can do. In the case of the B&O Railroad Museum, we find that the roof collapse offered an opportunity for the organization to transform its identity from that of a museum to that of an attraction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1080.0389","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['learning', 'organizational identity', 'interruptions']","The article discusses organizational learning and identity transformation triggered by rare events, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or DEI themes.

All learning has uncertain consequences, but learning from rare events is especially problematic.

Rare events also rouse uncertainty and bring on reactions to uncertainty such as wishful thinking, reliance on prior beliefs, biased probabilities, a search for more data, cautious action, and playing to audiences. The most important contingencies affecting these reactions are the content and strength of prior beliefs: people are unlikely to learn if they think they have nothing to learn.

Our model accounts for the effect of cognitive biases and hierarchical context on organizational interpretation. Because of their proximity to the interpretations of both strategic and front-line managers, middle managers can encourage divergence in interpretations of managers across hierarchical levels during early stages of the interpretation process and can blend and synthesize the divergent interpretations of managers during later stages. In this way middle managers contribute to a dynamic process of organizational interpretation in which multiple filters from throughout the organization help frame and enrich interpretations of rare and unusual events, which enables organizational learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0451","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['organizational interpretation', 'cognitive biases', 'hierarchical context']","The article discusses the role of middle managers in organizational learning and interpretation, touching on cognitive biases and hierarchical dynamics.

I test these arguments with a sample of U.S. bank mergers and find evidence that managers' perceptions of success in previous acquisitions is negatively related to the actual performance of the focal merger, and that this effect increases, rather than decreases, as managers accumulate experience. Consistent with the theoretical arguments developed, the effect is significantly attenuated as the knowledge is systematically articulated and codified and the stock of experience becomes more heterogeneous.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0459","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on superstitious learning in corporate acquisitions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

My data illustrate how disparity in attention to issues across the chain of command and the inability to coherently attend to weak signs of danger resulted in an unexpected crisis at Novo Nordisk, a world leader in diabetes care. The main contribution of my study is the development of the concept of attentional triangulation, which refers to the intersection of three interdependent dimensions of organizational attention (stability, vividness, and coherence) to identify issues that have the potential of having critical consequences for the organization.

The purpose of this paper is to address this question by focusing on direct social interaction, adopting a dialogical approach. The following argument is advanced. From a dialogical perspective, new knowledge in organizations originates in the individual ability to draw new distinctions concerning a task at hand. New distinctions may be developed because practitioners experience their situations in terms of already constituted distinctions, which lend themselves to further articulation. Further articulation develops when organizational members engage in dialogical exchanges. When productive, dialogue leads to self-distanciation, namely, to individuals taking distance from their customary and unreflective ways of acting as practitioners. Dialogue is productive depending on the extent to which participants engage relationally with one another. When this happens, participants are more likely to actively take responsibility for both the joint tasks in which they are involved and for the relationships they have with others. Self-distanciation leads to new distinctions through three processes of conceptual change (conceptual combination, conceptual expansion, and conceptual reframing), which, when intersubjectively accepted, constitute new knowledge. Several organizational examples, as well as findings from organizational knowledge research, are reinterpreted to illustrate the above points.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0435","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['dialogical', 'responsibility', 'relationships']","The article emphasizes the importance of dialogue and relational engagement among organizational members, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social responsibility and interpersonal relationships.

Although these types of experience often represent valuable sources of useful learning, several important learning challenges arise when a firm has extremely limited prior experience of the same type. Thus, we theorize that a certain threshold of a given type of experience is required before each type of experience becomes valuable, with low levels of experience harming the organization. Furthermore, we propose that success and recovery experience will interact to enhance each other's value. These conditions can help overcome learning challenges such as superstitious learning or learning from small samples. We investigate our ideas using a sample of the U.S. commercial banks founded between 1984 and 1998. Our results indicate that both success and recovery experience of a firm generate survival-enhancing learning, but only after a certain level of experience is reached. Furthermore, success and recovery experience enhance each other's learning value, consistent with the theories that emphasize the importance of richer and contrasting experience in providing useful knowledge.

Spin-Offs and the Technological Performance of Parent Firms","How do spin-offs\u2014new ventures created by former employees of an incumbent firm\u2014affect the technological performance of their parents? Conventional wisdom holds that spin-offs hurt parent firms: the parent loses key staff, routines are disrupted, and performance declines. Although having some basis in fact, we think the negative effects are overstated. We argue that spin-offs can enable parent firms to realign with their environment, thereby avoiding the oncoming obsolescence arising from the combination of organizational inertia and environmental drift. Using data from the hard disk drive industry, we find evidence that although the main effect of having a spin-off on a parent firm's technological performance is positive, the overall impact of a spin-off depends upon the technological sophistication of the spin-off and the time since the spin-off occurred. Indeed, parent firms of technologically sophisticated (successful) spin-offs initially suffer poorer technological performance, but over time they outperform firms that had no spin-offs. Both effects are amplified to the extent that the spin-off is more successful, which we attribute to both increased environmental realignment and the positive signal that successful spin-offs transmit to the broader labor market about the parent organization's reputation as an incubator of entrepreneurs and a desirable place to work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0480","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['performance', 'spin-offs', 'organizational inertia']","The article focuses primarily on the technological performance of parent firms and the impact of spin-offs, which is largely a technical and performance-oriented analysis.

While one leads to unrealistically high prices and profits as products become more substitutable, the results obtained using the other measure are in line with intuition. Using the more appropriate measure of product substitutability, we study the optimal investment mix in flexible and dedicated capacities in both monopoly and oligopoly settings. We find that the optimal investment in manufacturing flexibility tends to decrease as the products become closer substitutes; this is because (1) pricing can be used more effectively to balance supply and demand, and (2) the gains obtained by shifting production to the more profitable product are reduced due to increased correlation between the price potentials of the substitutable products. The value of flexibility always increases with demand variability. We also show that, as long as the optimal investments in dedicated capacity for both products are positive, the optimal expected prices and production quantities do not depend on the cost of the flexible capacity. Manufacturing flexibility simply allows the firm to achieve those expected values with lower capacity, while leading to higher expected profits.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01001.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product substitution, pricing, and capacity decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We demonstrate an alternative approach based on smoothed perturbation analysis (SPA), also known as conditional Monte Carlo. Numerical results and consequent design insights are obtained in determining the optimal control limits for exponentially weighted moving average and Bayes charts.

We examine the implementation of a supply chain planning process at a consumer electronics company, concentrating on the forecasting approach around which the process revolves. Our analysis focuses on the forecasting process and how it mediates and accommodates the functional biases that can impair the forecast accuracy. We categorize the sources of functional bias into intentional, driven by misalignment of incentives and the disposition of power within the organization, and unintentional, resulting from informational and procedural blind spots. We show that the forecasting process, together with the supporting mechanisms of information exchange and elicitation of assumptions, is capable of managing the potential political conflict and the informational and procedural shortcomings. We also show that the creation of an independent group responsible for managing the forecasting process, an approach that we distinguish from generating forecasts directly, can stabilize the political dimension sufficiently to enable process improvement to be steered. Finally, we find that while a coordination system\u2014the relevant processes, roles and responsibilities, and structure\u2014can be designed to address existing individual and functional biases in the organization, the new coordination system will in turn generate new individual and functional biases.

The demand at the retailer is a linearly decreasing function of price. The manufacturer sets the wholesale price first, and the retailer sets the retail price after observing the wholesale price. Both players set their prices based on their forecasts of demand. In the make\u2010to\u2010order scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity after observing the actual demand; in the make\u2010to\u2010stock scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity before the demand is realized. In the make\u2010to\u2010order scenario, we show that sharing the forecast unconditionally by the retailer with the manufacturer benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer. We also demonstrate that a side payment contract cannot induce Pareto\u2010optimal information sharing equilibrium, but a discount based wholesale price contract can. The social welfare as well as consumer surplus is higher under the discount contract, compared with under no information sharing. In the make\u2010to\u2010stock scenario, the manufacturer realizes additional benefits in the form of savings in inventory holding and shortage costs when forecasts are shared. If the savings from inventory holding and shortage costs because of information sharing are sufficiently high, then a side payment contract that induces Pareto\u2010optimal information sharing is feasible in the make\u2010to\u2010stock scenario.

This paper develops a model of incentives in presence of unforeseen events and offers a theoretical prediction of which of the empirically observed incentive structures should be used under which circumstances. The combination of three key influences drives the shape of the best incentive contract. First, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty, or the occurrence of events that cannot possibly be foreseen at the outset. These may force a change in the project's plan, making pure target setting insufficient. Second, fairness concerns dictate that the employee's expected compensation cannot be shifted downward by unforeseen events, because it would cause demotivation, hostility, and defection.

Our key results are as follows: (i) Variable costs drive vertical differentiation. In the presence of significant volume\u2010dependent manufacturing costs, the optimal portfolio contains a mix of vertically and horizontally differentiated products and an increase in the variable cost makes adding vertically differentiated products relatively more profitable; if fixed volume\u2010independent design costs dominate, the portfolio exhibits solely horizontal differentiation. (ii) Horizontal differentiation is the main profit lever, and vertical differentiation brings only a marginal benefit; this is true even when most of the consumers exhibit low willingness to pay for performance, which is often used as an excuse to offer low\u2010end products. (iii) There are more low\u2010quality products than high\u2010quality ones, and market coverage increases when the willingness to pay for performance increases.

Remanufacturing cost increases as the quality level decreases, and any unused returns may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. Decision variables include the amount to remanufacture each period for each return quality level and the amount of inventory to carry over for future periods for both returns (unremanufactured), and finished remanufactured products. Our model is grounded with data collected at Pitney\u2010Bowes from their mailing systems remanufacturing operations. We derive some analytic properties for the optimal solution in the general case, and provide a simple greedy heuristic to computing the optimal solution in the case of deterministic returns and demand. Under mild assumptions, we find that the firm always remanufactures the exact demand in each period. We also study the value of a nominal quality\u2010grading system in planning production. Based on common industry parameters, we analyze, via a numerical study, the increase in profits observed by the firm if it maintains separate inventories for each quality grade. The results show that a grading system increases profit by an average of 4% over a wide range of parameter values commonly found in the remanufacturing industry; this number increases as the returns volume increases. We also numerically explore the case where there are capacity constraints and find the average improvement of a grading system remains around 4%.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01033.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a tactical production-planning problem in remanufacturing, emphasizing profit and operational efficiency without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In an environment with both uncertain demand and supply, we characterize the total order quantity, the number of suppliers selected for order placement, and the allocation of the total order quantity among these selected suppliers. For deeper managerial insight, we also examine the sensitivity of the optimal sourcing decisions to interactions between uncertainties in product demand and supply reliability. We show that sourcing from a single supplier is an optimal strategy for environments characterized by high levels of demand uncertainty or high salvage values. A numerical analysis based on data obtained from an office products retailer further reinforces our analytical results.

We find that consumer inertia has both positive and negative effects on profits: it decreases demand (in period one) but intensifies competition among consumers for the product (in period two). We show that our model of inertia is consistent with well\u2010established behavioral regularities, such as loss aversion and probability weighting in the sense of prospect theory, and hyperbolic time preferences.

At the beginning of the selling season, the retailer announces both the price p h at which the product will be sold during the selling season and the post\u2010season clearance price p<p h for unsold items. We analyze two operating regimes: The \u201cno reservation regime\u201d allows a buyer either to purchase the product at price p h when he arrives or to enter a lottery to purchase at price p if the product remains unsold. The \u201creservation regime\u201d offers each buyer one extra option than the no reservation regime: reserve the product for purchase at the clearance price p. If the buyer reserves the product under the reservation regime and if it remains unsold at the end of the selling season, then he is obligated to purchase it at price p. We consider a situation in which heterogeneous customers with probabilistic valuation arrive in accord with a Poisson process. We characterize the rational purchasing behavior wherein each arriving customer is strategic; each customer takes other customers' purchasing behavior into consideration. By considering the Nash equilibrium of this game, we show that strategic customer behavior can render the customer to be worse off and the retailer to be better off under the reservation regime, despite the fact that this regime offers one extra option (reservation) to a customer. Hence, more purchasing options do not necessarily benefit customers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01041.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of purchasing options and customer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Leases to corporate consumers affect the price of used goods on the second\u2010hand market which in turn affect the buying and leasing behavior of individual consumers. The setting of prices (or volumes) for sale and lease to individual and corporate consumers is a complicated problem for manufacturers. We consider a manufacturer who concurrently sells and leases a finitely durable good to both individual and corporate consumers. The interaction between the manufacturer and consumers is modeled as a dynamic sequential game, where each player seeks to maximize its own payoff over an infinite horizon. We study how the corporate channel substitutability of new goods and used goods and transaction costs in the second\u2010hand market affect the manufacturer's pricing decisions, consumer behavior, and social welfare in the retail market. Making a number of simplifying assumptions, including two\u2010period lifetime for the finitely durable goods, we consider Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the solution concept. We show that the manufacturer can maximize her profit by segmenting consumers according to their willingness to pay. Selling and leasing are the mechanisms used for price discrimination in the retail market. We show that as she leases a larger share of her production to the corporate consumer, (1) the manufacturer does not necessarily have to adjust the optimal selling price of new goods to individual consumers, and the volume of sales of new goods to individual consumers can stay the same; (2) the manufacturer does increase the retail lease price, and the number of individual leases decreases; (3) the net supply of used goods on the market increases, leading to a lower market price for used goods; and (4) more individual consumers are able to participate in the market, and their collective welfare or net utility improves. We also show that as production costs increase the manufacturer increases prices, reducing volumes across all channels.

This growth has created powerful contract manufacturers (CMs) in several industries. Achieving a competitive cost position is often a primary motive for outsourcing. Outsourcing influences both the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) and the CM's production levels, and, therefore, through learning\u2010by\u2010doing renders future costs dependent on past outsourcing decisions. As such, outsourcing should not be viewed as a static decision that, once made, is not revisited. We address these considerations by analyzing a two\u2010period game between an OEM and a powerful CM wherein both firms can reduce their production costs through learning\u2010by\u2010doing. We find that partial outsourcing, wherein the OEM simultaneously outsources and produces in\u2010house, can be an optimal strategy. Also, we find that the OEM's outsourcing strategy may be dynamic\u2014i.e., change from period to period. In addition, we find both that the OEM may engage in production for leverage (i.e., produce internally when at a cost disadvantage) and that the CM may engage in low balling. These and other findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of considering learning, the power of the CM, and future periods when making outsourcing decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01024.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing and cost reduction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, many consumers are sophisticated enough to anticipate the availability of upgrades in the future. This creates the possibility that consumers might either postpone purchase or buy early on and never upgrade. In response, many software producers offer special upgrade pricing to old customers in order to mitigate the effects of strategic consumer behavior. We analyze the optimality of upgrade pricing by characterizing the relationship between magnitude of product improvement and the equilibrium pricing structure, particularly in the context of user upgrade costs. This upgrade cost (such as the cost of upgrading complementary hardware or drivers) is incurred by the user when she buys the new version but is not captured by the upgrade price for the software. Our approach is to formulate a game theoretic model where consumers can look ahead and anticipate prices and product qualities while the firm can offer special upgrade pricing. We classify upgrades as minor, moderate or large based on the primitive parameters. We find that at sufficiently large user costs, upgrade pricing is an effective tool for minor and large upgrades but not moderate upgrades. Thus, upgrade pricing is suboptimal for the firm for a middle range of product improvement. User upgrade costs have both direct and indirect effects on the pricing decision. The indirect effect arises because the upgrade cost is a critical factor in determining whether all old consumers would upgrade to a new product or not, and this further alters the product improvement threshold at which special upgrade pricing becomes optimal. Finally, we also analyze the impact of upgrade pricing on the total coverage of the market.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01030.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software pricing and consumer behavior without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem is to find jointly a schedule for order processing and a way of packing completed orders to form delivery batches such that the total distribution cost (or equivalently, the number of delivery batches) is minimized subject to the constraint that a given customer service level is guaranteed.

The disagreement outcome in the bargaining game is assumed to be the result of the corresponding non\u2010cooperative game. We describe an incentive\u2010compatible contract that leads to First Best investment and equal \u201cgain\u201d for all players, when the solution is \u201cinterior\u201d (as it almost certainly is in practice). A supplier that has superior security practices (i.e., is inherently safer) exploits its informational advantage by extracting an \u201cinformation rent\u201d in the usual spirit of incomplete information games. We also identify a special case of this contract, which is robust to moral hazard. The role of auditing in reinforcing investment incentives is also examined.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01031.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['risk management', 'supply chain', 'disruption']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and risk mitigation, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Motivating applications include virtual call centers, consisting of geographically dispersed centers, walk\u2010in health clinics, motor vehicle inspection stations, automobile emissions testing stations, and internal service systems. The choice of locations for such facilities influences both the travel cost and waiting times of users. In contrast to most previous research, we explicitly embed both customer travel/connection and delay costs in the objective function and solve the location\u2013allocation problem and choose facility capacities simultaneously. The choice of capacity for a facility that is viewed as a queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times could mean choosing a service rate for the servers (Scenario 1) or choosing the number of servers (Scenario 2). We express the optimal service rate in closed form in Scenario 1 and the (asymptotically) optimal number of servers in closed form in Scenario 2. This allows us to eliminate both the number of servers and the service rates from the optimization problems, leading to tractable mixed\u2010integer nonlinear programs. Our computational results show that both problems can be solved efficiently using a Lagrangian relaxation optimization procedure.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01034.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of facility location and optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

It incorporates the concepts of hidden actions, hidden information, and misaligned incentives, and conveys messages about power, trust, and reputation. The game depicts the adventures of Acme, the brand owner of a product manufactured by an outsourced supply chain. Through a series of negotiations, Acme attempts to influence its partners (two suppliers and two service providers) by distributing its procurement \u201cspend.\u201d These partners, in turn, sway each other via side payments. To simulate the non\u2010linear shifts in power that occur as outsourcing increases, we represent decision\u2010making by a voting scheme with uneven vote allocations. This paper analyzes a database of game results to reveal behavioral factors that can undermine conspicuous win\u2013win process improvements. For instance, preferences can be sensitive to the sequence in which the alternatives are encountered; decision\u2010makers might value not only their own rewards, but also fairness in the allocation of total gains; and effectiveness of negotiation tactics will vary with community norms of acceptable behavior. Along the way we extend the political economics literature about power in block\u2010based voting by proposing a heuristic approach for incorporating voter preferences.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01036.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","4","['fairness', 'power', 'trust']","The article discusses themes of fairness in allocation and power dynamics within outsourcing, which align with moderate woke themes.

For example, many retailers in the grocery industry will agree to broaden their assortments only if the manufacturer agrees to pay slotting fees for the new products. We investigate the role played by slotting fees in coordinating the assortment decisions in a supply chain. To do so, we study a single\u2010retailer, single\u2010manufacturer supply chain, where the retailer decides what assortment to offer to end customers. Double marginalization results in a discrepancy between the retailer's optimal assortment and the assortment that maximizes total supply chain profits. We consider a payment scheme that is analogous to slotting fees used in the grocery industry: the manufacturer pays the retailer a per\u2010product fee for every product offered by the retailer in excess of a certain target level. We show that, if the wholesale price is below some threshold level, this payment scheme induces the retailer to offer the supply\u2010chain\u2010optimal assortment and makes both parties better off.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2009.01039.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and the economic implications of slotting fees without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Taking into consideration whether consumers' valuations differ on either one dimension of heterogeneity or on both dimensions, we develop a framework for classifying newsvendor models that incorporate demand\u2010management effects.

We denote the action to commit one unit of on\u2010hand inventory to patient or impatient customers as the inventory\u2010commitment decision, and the initial inventory stocking as the inventory\u2010replenishment decision. We first characterize the optimal inventory\u2010commitment policy as a threshold type, and then prove that the optimal inventory\u2010replenishment policy is a base\u2010stock type.

We also evaluate and compare the performances of the optimal inventory\u2010commitment policy and the inventory\u2010rationing policy.

The forward densities and SPDs depend significantly on the slope and volatility of LIBOR rates, and mortgage markets activities have strong impacts on the shape of the forward densities. The SPDs exhibit a pronounced U-shape as a function of future LIBOR rates, suggesting that the state prices are high at both extremely low and high interest rates, which tend to be associated with recessions and periods of high inflation, respectively.

This relationship shows substantial cross-sectional variation across portfolios sorted on size, book-to-market, and past returns, especially conditional on the state of the economy. I show that a conditional model with investors' beliefs and an uncertainty risk factor is remarkably successful in explaining a large part of the cross-sectional variation in average portfolio returns.

One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature of option returns generated by nonlinear payoffs. We propose an alternative way to evaluate the statistical significance of option returns by comparing historical statistics to those generated by option pricing models. The most puzzling finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing out-of-the-money puts, is not inconsistent (i.e., is statistically insignificant) relative to the Black-Scholes model or the Heston stochastic volatility model due to the extreme sampling uncertainty associated with put returns. This sampling problem can largely be alleviated by analyzing market-neutral portfolios such as straddles or delta-hedged returns. The returns on these portfolios can be explained by jump risk premiums and estimation risk.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/11/4493/1568222","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial options and their pricing models without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We show that following liberalization, new firm growth occurs in countries and industries with lower entry barriers.

By considering multiplicative specifications for the CEO's utility and production functions, we generate a number of different results from traditional additive models. First, both the CEO's low fractional ownership (the Jensen\u2013Murphy incentives measure) and its negative relationship with firm size can be quantitatively reconciled with optimal contracting, and thus need not reflect rent extraction. Second, the dollar change in wealth for a percentage change in firm value, divided by annual pay, is independent of firm size, and therefore a desirable empirical measure of incentives. Third, incentive pay is effective at solving agency problems with multiplicative impacts on firm value, such as strategy choice.

We use the methodology of dynamic factor analysis for large datasets to investigate possible empirical linkages between forecastable variation in excess bond returns and macroeconomic fundamentals. We find that \u201creal\u201d and \u201cinflation\u201d factors have important forecasting power for future excess returns on U.S. government bonds, above and beyond the predictive power contained in forward rates and yield spreads. This behavior is ruled out by commonly employed affine term structure models where the forecastability of bond returns and bond yields is completely summarized by the cross-section of yields or forward rates. An important implication of these findings is that the cyclical behavior of estimated risk premia in both returns and long-term yields depends importantly on whether the information in macroeconomic factors is included in forecasts of excess bond returns. Without the macro factors, risk premia appear virtually acyclical, whereas with the estimated factors risk premia have a marked countercyclical component, consistent with theories that imply investors must be compensated for risks associated with macroeconomic activity.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/12/5027/1577464","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bond market premiums and macroeconomic factors without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Our empirical results suggest that the volatility risk alone predicts 48% of the variation in CDS spread levels, whereas the jump risk alone forecasts 19%. After controlling for credit ratings, macroeconomic conditions, and firms' balance sheet information, we can explain 73% of the total variation. We calibrate a Merton-type structural model with stochastic volatility and jumps, which can help to match credit spreads after controlling for the historical default rates. Simulation evidence suggests that the high-frequency-based volatility measures can help to explain the credit spreads, above and beyond what is already captured by the true leverage ratio.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/12/5099/1575387","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis related to credit default swaps without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

However, traditional full-service brokers that bundle execution with services remain a force and their commissions are still considerably higher than the marginal cost of trade execution. We hypothesize that commissions constitute a convenient way of charging a prearranged fixed fee for long-term access to a broker\u2019s premium services. We derive testable predictions based on this hypothesis and test them on a large sample of institutional trades from 1999 to 2003. We find that institutions negotiate commissions infrequently, and thus commissions vary little with trade characteristics. Institutions also concentrate their order flow with a relatively small set of brokers, with smaller institutions concentrating their trading more than large institutions and paying higher per-share commissions. These results are stable over time, are consistent with our predictions, and cannot be explained by cost-minimization alone. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the institutional brokerage market within the proposed framework and make informal predictions about future developments in the industry.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/12/5175/1577686","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brokerage commissions and trading patterns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Many studies directly estimate the DR news but back out the CF news as the residual. We argue that this approach has a serious limitation because the DR news cannot be accurately measured due to the small predictive power, and the CF news, as the residual, inherits the large misspecification error of the DR news. We apply this residual-based decomposition approach to Treasury bonds and equities and find results that are either counterintuitive or unrobust.

The model matches the equity risk premium, risk-free rate, and volatilities. From the intratemporal first-order condition, one can substitute out basic good consumption and the habit level, yielding a stochastic discount factor driven by two observable risk factors: luxury good consumption and the relative price of the two goods. I estimate these processes and find them to be heteroskedastic, implying time variation in the conditional volatility of the stochastic discount factor.

By removing potential sellers from the market, the restrictions have the effect of increasing the impact of trading on prices. The greater the desire of investors to trade, and the greater the restrictions, the larger the impact of the restrictions. In the data, particularly severe restrictions are associated with returns of over 30% around the ex-date, most of which are reversed when investors are allowed to sell again.

To compensate for these shortcomings, hedge funds protect themselves by requiring substantial discounts, negotiating repricing rights, and entering into short positions of the underlying stocks. We find that companies that obtain financing from hedge funds significantly underperform companies that obtain financing from other investors during the following two years.

There is a tremendous amount of short selling in our sample: short sales represent 24% of NYSE and 31% of Nasdaq share volume. Short sellers increase their trading following positive returns and they correctly predict future negative abnormal returns. These patterns are robust to controlling for voluntary liquidity provision and for opportunistic risk-bearing by short sellers. The results are consistent with short sellers trading on short-term overreaction of stock prices.

The buyer's information is conveyed through a first-stage competitive auction. A seller with unfavorable information about the asset accepts the cash offer of the highest bidder. A seller with favorable information proposes a take-it-or-leave-it counteroffer that entails buyer equity. Thus, the cash-equity decision reflects the seller's but not the buyer's information in contrast to the theoretical and empirical findings for mergers. The central prediction of our model is that there are large gains in wealth for both buyers and sellers in equity-based asset sales, whereas cash sales generate significantly smaller gains that typically accrue only to sellers. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/2/681/1594563","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of asset sales and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Responding to the concern, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York auctioned Y2K options to primary dealers. The options gave the dealers the right to borrow from the Fed at a predetermined interest rate. Using the implied volatilities of Y2K options and the on/off-the-run spread, we demonstrate that the Fed's action eased the fears of bond dealers, contributing to a drop in the liquidity premium of Treasury securities. Our analysis shows the link between the microstructure of government debt markets and the central bank's provision of liquidity. We argue that Y2K options and their effects on liquidity premium broadly conform to the economic theory on public provision of private liquidity.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/3/1021/1579032","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis related to liquidity in treasury markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2009","22","3","Amir Sufi\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Amir Sufi\n            \n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Chicago\n    \n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Amir Sufi, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637.

I find that bank lines of credit, also known as revolving credit facilities, are a viable liquidity substitute only for firms that maintain high cash flow. In contrast, firms with low cash flow are less likely to obtain a line of credit, and they rely more heavily on cash in their corporate liquidity management. An important channel for this correlation is the use of cash flow-based financial covenants by banks that supply credit lines. I find that firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with covenants, and banks restrict firm access to credit facilities in response to covenant violations. Using the cash-flow sensitivity of cash as a measure of financial constraints, I provide evidence that lack of access to a line of credit is a more statistically powerful measure of financial constraints than traditional measures used in the literature.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/3/1057/1578022","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of bank lines of credit and corporate liquidity management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To explain these findings, we consider both information and social factors. We find that firms are more likely to protect proximate employees in soft information industries (i.e., when information is difficult to transfer over long distances).

Prior literature suggests that synergies could arise due to taxes, market power, or efficiency improvements. Based on Value Line forecasts, we estimate the average synergy gains in a broad sample of 264 large mergers to be 10.03% of the combined equity value of the merging firms. The detailed data in Value Line projections allow for the decomposition of these gains into underlying operating and financial synergies. We estimate that tax savings contribute only 1.64% in additional value, while operating synergies account for the remaining 8.38%. Operating synergies are higher in focused mergers, while tax savings constitute a large fraction of the gains in diversifying mergers. The operating synergies are generated primarily by cutbacks in investment expenditures rather than by increased operating profits. Overall, the evidence suggests that mergers generate gains by improving resource allocation rather than by reducing tax payments or increasing the market power of the combined firm.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/3/1179/1579974","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mergers and their financial implications without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We examine management fees, total expense ratios, and total shareholder costs (including load charges). Fees vary substantially across funds and from country to country. To explain these differences, we consider fund, sponsor, and national characteristics. Fees differ by investment objectives: larger funds and fund complexes charge lower fees; fees are higher for funds distributed in more countries and funds domiciled in certain offshore locations (especially when selling into countries levying higher taxes). Substantial cross-country differences persist even after controlling for these variables. These remaining differences can be explained by a variety of factors, the most robust of which is that fund fees are lower in countries with stronger investor protection.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/3/1279/1581783","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund fees and their variations across countries without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or DEI.

Using data on the Euro-area government bond market, which features a unique negative correlation between credit quality and liquidity across countries, we show that the bulk of sovereign yield spreads is explained by differences in credit quality, though liquidity plays a nontrivial role, especially for low credit risk countries and during times of heightened market uncertainty. In contrast, the destination of large flows into the bond market is determined almost exclusively by liquidity. We conclude that credit quality matters for bond valuation but that, in times of market stress, investors chase liquidity, not credit quality.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/3/925/1578888","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bond markets, specifically the relationship between credit quality and liquidity, without any mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms.

The introduction of bank loan ratings leads to an increase in the use of debt by firms that obtain a rating, and also increases in firms' asset growth, cash acquisitions, and investment in working capital. Consistent with a causal effect of the ratings, the increase in debt usage and investment is concentrated in the set of borrowers who are of lower credit quality and do not have an issuer credit rating before 1995.

By carrying out laboratory sessions of this game in which subjects' overconfidence is a treatment variable, I find that overconfidence affects the information aggregation process by increasing the dispersion of estimates and decreasing the rate of estimates' convergence. However, even when subjects are not overconfident, qualitatively similar deviations from the fully rational model predictions are observed.

Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

Using daily option quotes on the S, and P 100 index and its 30 largest component stocks, we show that after controlling for the underlying asset's total risk, a higher amount of systematic risk leads to a higher level of implied volatility and a steeper slope of the implied volatility curve. Thus, systematic risk proportion can help differentiate the price structure across individual equity options.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/5/1981/1594135","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of systematic risk and option pricing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When short selling is not possible, competitive pressures among arbitrageurs rapidly drive prices to the equilibrium. However, the risk of margin calls slows the convergence process, because arbitrageurs who sell short too early face substantial losses if they are unable to synchronize their trades with other arbitrageurs (as in Abreu and Brunnermeier. 2002.

Firms with lowest takeover defense (democracy) pay a 25% higher spread on their bank loans as compared with firms with the highest takeover defense (dictatorship), after controlling for various firm and loan characteristics. Further investigations indicate that banks charge a higher loan spread to firms with higher takeover vulnerability mainly because of their concern about a substantial increase in financial risk after the takeover. Our results have important implications for understanding the link between a firm's governance structure and its cost of capital.

We analyze how they achieve this wedge, and at what cost. Indirect ownership through trusts, foundations, limited partnerships, and other corporations is prevalent but rarely creates a wedge (a pyramid). The primary sources of the wedge are dual-class stock, disproportionate board representation, and voting agreements. Each control-enhancing mechanism has a different impact on value. Our findings suggest that the potential agency conflict between large shareholders and public shareholders in the United States is as relevant as elsewhere in the world.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/8/3047/1590831","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the control mechanisms of family firms in the U.S. without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our index relies exclusively on measures of the market's assessment of adverse selection risk rather than on ex ante firm characteristics. We find that information asymmetry does affect the capital structure decisions of U.S. firms over the sample period 1973\u20132002. Our findings are robust to controlling for conventional leverage factors (size, tangibility, Q ratio, profitability), the sources of firms' financing needs, and such firm attributes as stock return volatility, stock turnover, and intensity of insider trading. For example, we estimate that on average, for every dollar of financing deficit to cover, firms in the highest adverse selection decile issue 30 cents of debt more than firms in the lowest decile. Overall, this evidence explains why the pecking order theory is only partially successful in explaining all of firms' capital structure decisions. It also suggests that the theory finds support when its basic assumptions hold in the data, as should reasonably be expected of any theory.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/8/3211/1590165","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital structure decisions and information asymmetry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We study 4,409 firms from twenty-nine countries to assess whether and why concerns about corporate governance result in fewer foreign holdings. We find that foreigners invest less in firms that reside in countries with poor outsider protection and disclosure and have ownership structures that are conducive to governance problems. This effect is particularly pronounced when earnings are opaque, indicating that information asymmetry and monitoring costs faced by foreign investors likely drive the results.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/8/3245/1591710","article","RFS","Finance","3","['governance', 'corporate governance', 'disclosure']","The article discusses corporate governance and its impact on foreign investment, which touches on ethical considerations in finance.

SOX increased directors' workload and risk (reducing the supply), and increased demand by mandating that firms have more outside directors. We find both broad-based changes and cross-sectional changes (by firm size). Board committees meet more often post-SOX and Director and Officer (D&O) insurance premiums have doubled. Directors post-SOX are more likely to be lawyers/consultants, financial experts, and retired executives, and less likely to be current executives. Post-SOX boards are larger and more independent.

Our approach is computationally simple and easily modified and extended to capture the effect of transaction costs, for example, produces sensible portfolio weights, and offers robust performance in and out of sample. In contrast, the traditional approach of first modeling the joint distribution of returns and then solving for the corresponding optimal portfolio weights is not only difficult to implement for a large number of assets but also yields notoriously noisy and unstable results.

In this paper, we propose a new methodology to test whether or not two competing linear asset pricing models have the same Hansen-Jagannathan distance. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic depends on whether the competing models are correctly specified or misspecified, and on whether the competing models are nested or non-nested. In addition, given the increasing interest in misspecified models, we propose a simple methodology for computing the standard errors of the estimated stochastic discount factor parameters that are robust to model misspecification. Using monthly data on 25 size and book-to-market ranked portfolios and the one-month T-bill, we show that the commonly used returns and factors are, for the most part, too noisy for us to conclude that one model is superior to the other models in terms of Hansen-Jagannathan distance. Specifically, there is little evidence that conditional and intertemporal capital asset pricing model (CAPM)-type specifications outperform the simple unconditional CAPM. In addition, we show that many of the macroeconomic factors commonly used in the literature are no longer priced once potential model misspecification is taken into account.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/9/3449/1571191","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing models without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

More importantly, we assess the economic value of the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power of the empirical models, and find two key results: (1) a risk-averse investor will pay a high performance fee to switch from a dynamic portfolio strategy based on the random walk model to one that conditions on the forward premium with stochastic volatility innovations and (2) strategies based on combined forecasts yield large economic gains over the random walk benchmark.

The local information advantage is pervasive across all major geographical regions, but is strongest for emerging market funds and funds holding illiquid securities. These results are robust to adjustments for fund fees, serial correlation, backfill bias, and incubation bias.

Equilibrium prices may therefore fail to impound publicly available information. While this creates profit opportunities for ambiguity-neutral investors, ambiguity-averse investors perceive that the benefit of ambiguity reduction outweighs the cost of trading against investors who have superior information.

More specifically, we estimate illiquidity using structural formulae in line with Kyle's (1985) lambda for a comprehensive sample of stocks.

In the literature, the preferred choice of estimator is usually maximum likelihood (ML). ML has strong asymptotic justification but is not necessarily the best method in finite samples. This paper proposes a simulation-based method. When it is used in connection with ML, it can improve the finite-sample performance of the ML estimator while maintaining its good asymptotic properties. The method is implemented and evaluated here in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and in the Vasicek bond and bond option pricing model. It is especially favored when the bias in ML is large due to strong persistence in the data or strong nonlinearity in pricing functions. Monte Carlo studies show that the proposed procedures achieve bias reductions over ML estimation in pricing contingent claims when ML is biased. The bias reductions are sometimes accompanied by reductions in variance. Empirical applications to U.S. Treasury bills highlight the differences between the bond prices implied by the simulation-based approach and those delivered by ML. Some consequences for the statistical testing of contingent-claim pricing models are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/22/9/3669/1573193","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical methodologies for financial estimation without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

These predictions can be evaluated using data on the diffusion of supplier innovations that give competitive advantage to firms in the buyer industry. Here, the diffusion of new ship types is studied using the heterogeneous diffusion model and data on shipping firm-shipbuilder networks, showing that valuable innovations remain rare because they are not adopted by distant firms in geographical and network space.

Traditional arguments in the boundaries of the firm literature suggest that firms will tend to produce sets of complementary components internally, while more recent modularity studies argue that firms can outsource to gain flexibility. We resolve these views by examining concurrent sourcing, which arises when firms both make and buy the same components. We argue that concurrent sourcing of complementary components becomes more common in two cases: when firms have relevant knowledge about the components in conjunction with suppliers (interfirm expertise) and, perhaps more surprisingly, within the firm (within-firm shared expertise). The results suggest that firms often need to make in order to know, but can partially outsource if they possess sufficient expertise.

Using data on the governance choices and subsequent performance of alliances in the German telecommunications industry, we find that the optimal configuration of formal and relational governance mechanisms depends on the assets involved in an alliance, with formal mechanisms best suited to property-based assets and relational governance best suited to knowledge-based assets. Furthermore, a mismatch between governance mechanisms and asset type can harm the performance of the alliance.

In particular, if firms choose their governance structures as part of a constrained performance maximization process, then application of an appropriate empirical methodology should reveal statistical evidence of such behavior. In this study we take advantage of the endogenous switching regression model framework to determine whether such predicted optimizing behavior can be corroborated by the data. The model allows us to test explicitly for selection behavior in accordance with comparative advantage and, concomitantly, the presence of selectivity bias, in estimating the impact of CEO duality on firm performance. The selection and performance equations are modeled in accordance with the extant accounting, economics, and management literature on the impact of the dual governance structure on firm performance. Overall, we tested four performance measures for the entire sample of firm-year observations as well as for the largest three industries in terms of sample sizes. The major finding, robust in all cases, is that there is no evidence to support a contention that CEO duality is a structure purposefully chosen for optimizing performance. If firms are indeed choosing the dual leadership structure, they are doing so for reasons other than improving performance from what it would be otherwise. In fact, for performance measured as market return and earnings per share, there is evidence of a significant selectivity bias that acts to lower performance below what it would have been under random assignment. For performance measured by Tobin's q and return on assets, we found neither evidence of selectivity bias, nor any significant marginal performance impacts of CEO duality. Such findings are inconsistent with an endogenous governance theory, at least when applied to firm performance.

In the empirical context of corporate venture capital (CVC), we analyze a sample of 1,646 start-up-stage ventures that received funding during the 1990s. Under a regime of weak intellectual property protection (IPP), an entrepreneur-CVC investment relationship is less likely to form when the entrepreneurial invention targets the same industry as corporate products. In contrast, under a strong IPP regime, industry overlap is associated with an increase in the likelihood of an investment relationship. Our findings suggest that many relationships do not form because the corporation will not invest unless the entrepreneur discloses his or her invention, and the entrepreneur may be wary of doing so, fearing imitation. To the extent that a CVC has greater capability and inclination to target same-industry ventures, such industry overlap would exacerbate imitation concerns under a weak IPP regime, yet facilitate an investment relationship under a strong IPP regime. Beyond CVC, this insight may explain patterns of other interorganizational relationships, including research and development alliances and technology licensing between start-ups and incumbents.

Finally, we predict that the value of partner-specific experience will increase under high levels of firm-specific uncertainty.

This paper explores the conditions under which firms participate in this endeavor. Building on theories of how social activists inspire changes in organizational norms, beliefs, and practices, we hypothesize that shareholder actions and regulatory threats are likely to prime firms to adopt practices consistent with the aims of a broader social movement. We find empirical evidence of direct and spillover effects. In the domain of private politics, shareholder resolutions filed against a firm and others in its industry increase a firm's propensity to engage in practices consistent with the aims of the related social movement. Similarly, in the realm of public politics, threats of state regulations targeted at a firm's industry as well as regulations targeted at other industries increase the likelihood that the firm will engage in such practices. These findings extend existing theory by showing that both activist groups and government actors can spur changes in organizational practices, and that challenges mounted against a single firm or a single industry can inspire both firm and field-level changes.

In this research note, I suggest an alternative approach for achieving this objective: reporting differences in predicted probabilities associated with discrete changes in key independent variable values. This intuitive approach to interpretation is especially useful when the theoretically interesting or empirically relevant changes in independent variables values are not very small, and also for models that contain interaction terms (or higher-order terms such as quadratics). Although the graphical presentations recommended by Hoetker implicitly embody this approach, they typically fail to include appropriate measures of statistical significance, and may therefore lead to erroneous conclusions. In order to calculate such measures, I recommend and demonstrate an intuitive simulation-based approach to statistical interpretation, developed by King et al. (2000), that has gained widespread adherence in the field of political science. Throughout the article, I provide a running example based on research that has previously appeared in the Strategic Management Journal.

However, the deployment of firm-specific knowledge often requires key employees to make specialized human capital investments that are not easily redeployable to other settings. Thus, in the absence of effective safeguards and trust building devices, employees with foresight may be reluctant to make such specialized investments. This study explores both economic- and relationship-based governance mechanisms that might mitigate this underinvestment problem. Effective use of these governance mechanisms enables a firm to obtain greater performance from its efforts to deploy firm-specific knowledge resources.

Counterfactual history can add to our understanding of the context-specific construction of resource-based competitive advantage and path dependence, and causal modeling can help to reconceptualize the relationships between resources and performance. In particular, resource properties can be regarded as mediating mechanisms in these causal relationships.

We find evidence of inertial influences as experienced entrants tend to follow their previous decisions when making subsequent entry attempts. Further, they are less responsive in their foreign entry strategies to the institutional transformation in a given host country than inexperienced firms. We also find that the experience gained from relational entries results in more hierarchical entry attempts, but hierarchical entry experience results in fewer relational entry attempts.

Yet appropriate data analytic approaches that use information about firms over time to identify stable strategic groups and their evolutionary paths have been lacking. To overcome such limitations, this research proposes a new clusterwise bilinear multidimensional scaling model that can simultaneously identify (1) the number of strategic groups, (2) the dimensions on which the strategic groups are based, and (3) the evolution of the strategy of these groups over time. Our discussion encompasses various alternative model specifications, together with model selection heuristics based on statistical information criteria. An illustration of the proposed methodology using data pertaining to strategic variables for a sample of public banks in the tristate area of New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania across three time periods (1995, 1999, and 2003) identifies two underlying dimensions with five strategic groups that display very different evolutionary paths over time. Post hoc analysis shows pronounced differences in firm performance across the five derived strategic groups.

In this study, we approach dynamic capabilities in a framework of two complementary processes. On one hand, firms can build upon existing capabilities in products and markets in which they have experienced recent success; on the other hand, they can also intentionally focus on other products and markets in which they seek to build capabilities to address their lack of recent success. We examine these two processes within project-based industries and identify replication and renewal as two types of strategies that firms use to add a dynamic component to their capabilities.

As interest in alliance capability has grown, we see two streams of research emerge that address different, but equally important, issues related to this subject: one stream that focuses on how alliance capability develops in firms, and a second stream that investigates what elements specifically constitute a firm's alliance capability. In recent literature, the question of how firms develop alliance capability has received greater attention than the question of what elements actually comprise it; therefore, in this study we address the latter issue in great depth. We do this by building on prior research and on our fieldwork, to conceptualize alliance management capability as a multidimensional construct that comprises three distinct but related aspects or skills to address the following aspects in managing a given individual alliance after it is up and running: coordination, communication, and bonding. We then test our conceptualization in a framework that also links this capability to relevant outcomes at the alliance and firm level. We use survey and secondary data from a large sample of interfirm relationships between software service providers and three major global software vendors. We find general empirical support for our conceptualization of alliance management capability and for its predictive validity in impacting certain alliance outcomes.

Asset orchestration, a central component of dynamic managerial capabilities and of resource management, highlights the importance of integrating (matching) resource investment and deployment decisions. Building on these recent theoretical advances, we examine the contingent nature of resource investment and deployment decisions. The results, based on a sample of banking firms, indicate that firm performance suffers when managers' investment decisions deviate from the norms of rivals for both human and physical capital. However, when deployment decisions support investment decisions, greater investment deviation, both high and low, generally enhances performance. Specifically, firm performance is optimized by making congruent resource investment and deployment decisions as opposed to maximizing or economizing either decision independently. Therefore, resource management via asset orchestration is vital for superior performance.

Far less is known, however, about the actions firms take to reduce the outward flow of knowledge through markets for skilled labor. This study investigates the efficacy of a lever that has received little research attention: corporate reputations for toughness in patent enforcement. Drawing on unique data on enforcement activity, intra-industry inventor mobility, and patent citations in the U.S. semiconductor industry, we find that a firm's litigiousness significantly reduces spillovers otherwise anticipated from departures of employee inventors, particularly when the hiring organizations are entrepreneurial ventures. Surprisingly, the deterrent effects of patent enforcement are similar in magnitude for firms located in California, a state characterized by open norms for knowledge trading, and firms headquartered in other U.S. states. The study sheds new light on the strategic actions firms use to prevent rivals from capturing value from their investments in human capital and research and development.

Understanding the strengths and limitations of these databases is crucial for informing database selection and research design. In this study I conduct an analysis of five prominent alliance databases. Focusing on technology alliances (those formed for the purposes of joint research or cross-technology transfer), I examine the databases' consistency of coverage and completeness, and assess whether different databases yield the same patterns in sectoral composition, temporal trends, and geographic patterns in alliance activity. I also replicate three previously published alliance studies to assess the impact of data limitations on research outcomes. The results suggest that the databases only report a fraction of formally announced alliances, which could have detrimental consequences for some types of research. However, the databases exhibit strong symmetries in patterns of sectoral composition, alliance activity over time, and geographic participation. Furthermore, the replications of previous studies yielded results that were highly similar to those obtained in the original studies.

Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from shareholders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Yet, the expected positive association between risk and return, familiar from financial markets, is elusive. Measuring risk as the variance of a series of accounting-based returns, Bowman obtained the puzzling result of a negative association between risk and mean return. This finding, known as the Bowman paradox, has spawned a remarkable number of publications, and various explanations have been suggested. The present study contributes to this literature by showing that skewness of individual firm' return distributions has a considerable spurious effect on the empirically estimated mean-variance relationship. I devise a method to disentangle true and spurious effects, illustrate it using simulations, and apply it to empirical data. It turns out that the size of the spurious effect is such that, on average, it explains the larger part of the observed negative relationship. My results might thus help to reconcile mean-variance approaches to risk-return analysis with other, ex-ante, approaches. In concluding, I show that the analysis of skewness is linked to all three streams of literature devoted to explaining the Bowman paradox.

Market turbulence generated by core firm decisions in competing differentiated ecosystems can generate financial losses and exit for complementary niche market firms. I develop hypotheses predicting which niche markets will suffer larger losses and be more susceptible to shakeouts, and how core firm decisions will drive complementor performance and survival. I then apply these hypotheses to brand-based differentiated ecosystems in the automotive industry, where networks of suppliers, customers, and complementors surround car manufacturers. More specifically, I study the complementary niche market of automotive leasing, where manufacturers sway leasing markets through product change, entry, and subsidization. To test the hypotheses, I use a proprietary dataset of 200,000 individual car leases between 1997\u20132002 to identify how manufacturer product design and niche market entry drive complementor losses and exit. These data allow a unique opportunity to understand how the strategic choices of core firms can have substantial and often devastating effects on niche markets in their ecosystem. Further, the results suggest how the dynamic capabilities to adapt to core firm behavior might improve performance for certain niche market complementors.

Under the optimal contracting theory, observed compensation contracts are optimally determined, aligning the interests of managers and shareholders. Under the managerial hegemony theory, observed compensation contracts deviate from the optimum because top managers with power over boards are able to influence their own pay. I argue that the impact of managerial power over boards on managerial pay, and hence the deviation of compensation contracts from the optimum, is contingent on the transparency of managerial compensation. Within this framework, I investigate the impact of supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs)\u2014 historically the least transparent compensation component\u2014 on opportunistic decision making. An empirical analysis based on a time series sample of CEOs of S&P/TSX60 firms provides support of the compensation transparency theory. I find that SERP benefits are primarily driven by variables proxying for CEO power over the board, whereas more transparent compensation components are primarily driven by economic factors. The results also suggest that CEOs whose SERPs are contingent on firm performance appear to reduce firm R&D expenditures as they approach retirement. Both findings provide important contributions to existing research on the impact of managerial compensation on opportunistic decisions.

Instead, competition can be interpreted differently by multiple stakeholders of a value chain. However, due to managerial blind spots, such various interpretations of competition are less than apparent to management. Yet explanations of such blind spots are not well documented. Hence, to explain such blind spots, a conceptual model based on overconfidence biases is developed in which managers develop a \u2018self-centered\u2019 view of competition that blinds them from the competitive beliefs of their value chain customers. Differences in competitive beliefs, thus, arise and are argued to contribute to such managerial blind spots. Furthermore, to empirically examine such managerial blind spots, the competitive perceptions held by various members of a swine genetics value chain were surveyed. Through cluster and MANOVA analyses, this study shows that, unlike institutional/macro-cultural explanations of competition, these members do not share a common consensus of the key attributes and groupings of competition.

A growing literature spanning multiple disciplines indicates most actors' selfish utility maximizing behaviors are bounded by norms of fairness. Rather than being purely self-interested, people behave reciprocally by rewarding others whose actions they deem fair and willingly incurring costs to punish those they deem unfair. Economists show that employers who are perceived as distributionally fair by their employees generate comparatively more value due to the positively reciprocal behavior of those employees. The organizational justice literature distinguishes two additional types of fairness assessed by employees. Drawing from both these bodies of work, we employ stakeholder theory to propose how perceptions of fairness result in reciprocity (1) extending to all stakeholders of the firm and (2) affecting firm performance.

Strategy scholars have recently developed a theoretical model that links such activities to shareholder value when a firm suffers a negative event; we test key portions of this theory of the \u2018insurance-like\u2019 property of CSR activity. We posit that such activity leads to positive attributions from stakeholders, who then temper their negative judgments and sanctions toward firms because of this goodwill. We extend the risk management model by theorizing that some types of CSR activities will be more likely to create goodwill and offer insurance-like protection than other types. We delineate several firm and event specific characteristics that we expect to influence the link between CSR activities and an insurance effect. We then test our model using an event study of 178 negative legal/regulatory actions against firms throughout the 11 years from 1993\u20132003.

To avoid below-par performance, firms need to adapt quickly to this significant change in their environment, making real options very valuable to them. Although firms' international investments can potentially provide such flexibility, this issue has not been empirically examined in a context of such dramatic negative change. We consider two types of international investments by firms in this regard, foreign direct investments and export-related international investments, developing two measures that directly assess the flexibility derived from each that are new to the literature. Based on these measures, we find evidence that both types of international investments provided valuable flexibility for Korean firms during the economic crisis conditions. This study contributes to the literature by showing that firms with real options investments in place have a greater ability to flexibly adapt their overall operations in line with unforeseen negative environmental change, in contrast to firms without such investments.

Although outsourcing provides access to a new technology, it does not guarantee that a firm can subsequently integrate the technology with existing business processes and leverage it in the marketplace. This distinction, however, has rarely been made in the literature. In the context of business process enhancing technologies, this study builds on the resource-based and knowledge-based views to study the impact of outsourcing on firms' subsequent performance in the market and their integrative capabilities, that is, a firm's capacity to use and assimilate a new technology with its business processes and build upon it. The study argues that greater reliance on outsourcing may reduce a firm's learning by doing, internal investment, and tacit knowledge applications, thereby impeding a firm's integrative capabilities and performance in the market. The study uses survey and archival data on banks' outsourcing strategies for Internet adoption to test for the performance consequences of outsourcing, which are found to be negative. However, the findings also show that outsourcing is less detrimental for firms with experience in prior related technology.

The primary output of invention is new knowledge. However, because of its \u2018sticky\u2019 characteristics, knowledge may not easily diffuse to external shareholders, leading to knowledge asymmetries between managers/employees and external suppliers of capital. Many valuable R&D projects may thus fail to attract external financing, limiting a firm's ability to invest in R&D. In this study, we examine how the cash flow and signaling properties of a firm's patents and certain aspects of its alliance strategy can attenuate such problems. Specifically, we suggest that a firm's R&D investments positively predict the level of its liquid asset holdings. This is due to the fact that invention-induced knowledge asymmetries increase the firm's cost of accessing external liquid capital. However, holding cash entails opportunity costs. In this regard, we also find that patent production and certain alliance activities provide important signaling mechanisms, which reduce knowledge asymmetries between the firm and capital markets, and consequently lower the firm's need to hold liquid assets. Empirical tests were conducted using a sample of 108 U.S-based biotechnology firms.

Furthermore, we suggest that organizational slack would improve firm performance and accentuate the positive relationship between corporate acquisitions and firm performance during an environmental jolt; however, it would have negative impact on firm performance and make the acquisition-performance relationship more negative before and after a jolt.

Despite this attention, empirical results relating firm size to innovation remain exceedingly fragile. This study proposes three reasons for the empirical inconsistencies in the literature: that small and large firms differ in their: (1) stock of technological experiences, (2) use of own- and partner-firm experiences, and (3) abilities to translate own- and partner-firm experiences into innovation activity. Results from a 10-year study of 463 semiconductor firms demonstrate that the mixed findings generated from prior work are partially attributed to these three general propositions. In particular, resource flows, in the form of operating experience developed internally and accessed through codevelopment partners, positively affect innovation activity; but these benefits diminish as a firm increases in size. The findings broadly support the notion that differences in the incentives and abilities of small and large firms give rise to heterogeneity in the firms' innovation activity.

The arguments are supported by the analysis of a series of first-order autoregressive models. Our findings further suggest that the positive effect of good stakeholder relations on the persistence of superior performance is not as strong as that of some other firm resources, such as technological knowledge, but it is the only factor examined that promises to help a firm recover from inferior performance. Therefore, the role of positive stakeholder relations in helping poorly performing firms recover is found to be more critical than its role in helping superior firms sustain their performance advantage.

While the volume of interfirm collaboration has increased dramatically in recent decades, the determinants of firm-level choices among alternate modes of such cooperative activity remain relatively understudied. We develop a conceptual model of factors determining collaborative mode choice at the organizational portfolio level. These factors include the firm-level appropriation environment, in which deal-level choices have portfolio-level spillover implications, as well as governance capabilities developed by the firm over time. Using a random sample of innovating biotechnology start-ups, we assemble a firm-year panel dataset that aggregates transaction-level collaboration data to the firm-year level, allowing us to characterize firms' portfolios of collaborative deals. We find broad empirical support for our model, suggesting that a firm's appropriation environment and governance capabilities strongly influence portfolio-level collaboration mode choices. In addition, we explore the implications of governance capability development, finding that experience with particular modes, as well as deviations from existing capabilities, impact firm valuation.

We highlight product heterogeneity as a determinant of this make or ally choice. We propose that firms turn to horizontal alliances in order to implement product expansion projects that require greater resources than those available to them. More precisely, we hypothesize that a firm is more likely to launch a new product through a horizontal alliance rather than autonomously when the resource requirements of the project are greater, the resources available to the firm are more limited, there is a mismatch between resource endowment and requirement, and the firm's collaborative competence allows it to better cope with the interorganizational concerns that collaboration with competitors raises. We find support for our arguments on a sample of 310 new aircraft developments launched between 1945 and 2000, either by a single prime contractor or as a horizontal alliance in which prime contractorship is shared with another industry incumbent.

Theoretically, we suggest that the ambiguity surrounding these questions reflects the tendency of researchers to view control and collaboration as opposing objectives, studying one or the other; in contrast, we provide a more integrative perspective that blends the two objectives, focusing on common underlying issues relating to enhancing partner commitment, ensuring partner knowledge contributions, and reducing partner risks. We address the most salient design consideration for IJV partners, that is, IJV ownership structure, to posit that joint consideration of the control benefit of a higher foreign ownership level in IJVs and the collaboration benefit of a more balanced IJV ownership structure results in an expected inverted U-curve relationship between foreign ownership and IJV productivity. Additionally, we posit and test how three environmental contingencies, by affecting the need for control and collaboration in IJVs, would further influence the specific shape of the inverted U-curve relationship. We find strong support for our theory using an extensive longitudinal dataset of over 5,000 IJVs in China from 1999\u20132003. We discuss the value of our approach and findings both for researchers and for IJV partners seeking the dual benefits of control and collaboration.

The formation of alliances by poorly embedded firms","Recent research shows that preexisting network structure constrains the formation of new interorganizational alliances. Firms that are poorly embedded in a network structure are less likely than richly embedded firms to form alliances, because they lack informational and reputational benefits. This study examines the types of ties that poorly embedded firms can form to overcome the constraints that their structural positions impose, in turn helping to explain how firms' actions can transform existing network structures. We argue that poorly embedded firms are more likely to participate in ties characterized by social asymmetry than in ties characterized by structural homophily. We analyze the terms of trade that socially asymmetric partners negotiate for alliance governance and discuss how such alliances influence network dynamics.

Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems.

Based on a survey of the capability transfer activities of 161 engineering units of multinationals in the Chinese automotive industry, we empirically validate the distinction between individual and collective teaching activities and absorptive capacity. More importantly, we find that the largely underexplored collective-level mechanisms, such as collective teaching and collective absorptive capacity, are more effective in transferring both collective knowledge and individual knowledge in comparison to their individual-based counterparts.

One hypothesis is that opportunistic managers release earnings at these times of decreased media attention to \u201chide\u201d their bad news and reduce the associated market penalty. Using firm\u2010level tests that focus on only those firms that switch their disclosure timing (rather than consistently report at the same time), we find no evidence that managers opportunistically report worse news after the market closes or on Fridays. We then explore other determinants of the timing decision, including the more benign hypothesis that managers with worse earnings news release earnings after the market closes to more broadly disseminate the information. Consistent with desiring more time for the market to assimilate the announcement, we find some evidence that more complex firms tend to announce earnings after the market closes. We also find that these announcements are associated with greater abnormal volume, possibly indicating a successful dissemination strategy. We also find that the corporate headquarters location, the size of the firm, the number of analysts covering the firm, and industry membership are all significant explanatory variables for the timing decision. Overall, our findings are consistent with efficient capital markets that are effective at monitoring new information, regardless of the time of the announcement.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/84/1/157/3039/The-Timing-of-Earnings-Announcements-An","other articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of earnings announcements and strategic disclosure without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We show that the optimal hurdle rate can even be below the firm's cost of capital under plausible circumstances.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a positive association between management earnings forecast errors and accruals. This positive association is stronger for firms operating in a more uncertain business environment and for firms in industries exhibiting greater covariation between accruals and growth\u2010related activities. Moreover, this positive association is significant when accruals likely reflect managers' true beliefs about firms' business prospects, but is nonexistent when accruals are likely manipulated to boost managers' trading gains.

From late 2004 to mid\u20102006, more than 250 U.S. firms uncovered and corrected operating lease accounting errors either by formal restatement\u2014required for errors deemed material\u2014or by a less visible current\u2010period \u201ccatch\u2010up\u201d adjustment. We test the role of materiality considerations outlined in SAB No. 99 as well as factors outside authoritative guidance in explaining the correction method chosen. Although both quantitative and qualitative materiality considerations cited in the guidance explain a large portion of the variation in firms' error correction decisions, we find that the prior actions of other firms also appear to play a major role. We also find that clerical considerations, but not strategic disclosure concerns, help explain cross\u2010sectional variation in the timing of firms' error correction announcements.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/84/3/659/3114/Materiality-Decisions-and-the-Correction-of","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['materiality', 'accounting errors', 'financial reporting']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting practices and error correction without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Further, the nature of MW varies with the type of experience. However, these associations are not detectable using Section 302 reports.

I find that firms actively engaged in tax sheltering exhibit larger ex post book\u2010tax differences and more aggressive financial reporting practices. Using this model of tax shelter firm characteristics, I identify a broad sample of predicted tax shelter firms from the population of firms.

Consistent with the intent of these reforms, we find that the negative relation between analysts' stock recommendations and residual income valuations is diminishing following regulations. We also show that residual income valuations, developed using analysts' earnings forecasts, relate more positively with future returns. However, we document that stock recommendations continue to relate negatively with future returns.

Results indicate that brainstorming effectiveness is significantly higher for teams brainstorming electronically relative to teams using traditional face\u2010to\u2010face brainstorming. There is no significant difference in brainstorming effectiveness between electronic interactive brainstorming and electronic nominal brainstorming. Brainstorming effectiveness is significantly higher for teams receiving content facilitation relative to teams not receiving content facilitation. The post\u2010brainstorming fraud risk assessments are significantly higher than the pre\u2010brainstorming assessments in all treatment conditions, indicating that the SAS No. 99 mandated brainstorming session has the intended effect. This research informs audit practice by demonstrating that computer\u2010mediated fraud brainstorming can be more effective than face\u2010to\u2010face brainstorming and also by establishing the effectiveness of content facilitation for improving the quality of the fraud risk factors generated by auditors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/84/4/1209/3076/Fraud-Brainstorming-Using-Computer-Mediated","other articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of fraud brainstorming techniques without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with tax capitalization, we find that the performance of cross\u2010listed shares is negatively related to dividend yield, suggesting an abnormal price increase for shares with greater anticipated taxable capital gains. Due to barriers to cross\u2010border arbitrage, underlying home\u2010country securities, on average, do not react during the event, creating a temporary tax\u2010induced pricing spread. When costs of arbitrage are low, the pricing disparity quickly dissipates and home\u2010country shares closely mirror the pricing of their cross\u2010listed counterparts. In further tests, we are unable to document lock\u2010in behavior, which predicates a decrease in prices attributable to a surge in volume for shares with greater accrued taxable capital gains.

Further, evidence from Experiment 1 supports the prediction that credibility judgments mediate the effect of a mismatch on investment decisions. Finally, evidence from Experiment 2 partially supports the prediction that users who encounter a mismatch between actual and expected accounting choices are more likely to search for additional information than are users who encounter a match. The results have implications for accounting researchers, regulators, and managers interested in understanding how firms' accounting choices affect users' decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/84/5/1465/3095/The-Effects-of-Expected-and-Actual-Accounting","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['accounting choices', 'credibility judgments', 'investment decisions']","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting choices and their impact on user decisions, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using a sample of convenience store chains, we show that market\u2010type dispersion is positively associated with the degree of franchising at the chain level as well as the probability of franchising a given store within a chain. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of market\u2010type dispersion and to other determinants of franchising such as the stores' geographic dispersion. Additional analyses suggest that chains that do not franchise cope with market\u2010type dispersion by decentralizing operations from headquarters to their stores and providing their store managers higher variable pay.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/84/6/1749/3128/Organizational-Design-and-Control-across-Multiple","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['decision rights', 'incentives', 'market-type dispersion']","The article primarily focuses on operational and managerial aspects of franchising without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

First, by adjusting the mix of audit and nonaudit fees, companies with high business risk induce auditor conservatism, while companies with low business risk induce auditor aggressiveness. Second, if auditor conservatism is in force, a greater client pressure on auditors improves audit quality; but if auditor aggressiveness is in force, a greater client pressure on auditors impairs audit quality. Third, the nature of a firm's investment inefficiency (overinvestment or underinvestment) depends on its auditor's attestation (conservative or aggressive).
