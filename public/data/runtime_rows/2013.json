We find that institutional change occurs in mature organizational fields when organizations located at the field center, periphery, and in between trigger different multilevel processes. Our results show that when society-level evolutionary change created organization-level resource pressures that undermined the central values of a mature field, the group of actors between the field center and periphery served as intermediaries in the institutional change process bringing the societal, field, and organizational levels back into alignment.

But how group routine change occurs through this process of vicarious learning is not clear. Using a qualitative field study of drug development teams in one pharmaceutical firm, I examine how groups change routines drawing on the prior related experience of other groups. An inductive analysis suggests that this process does not follow the simple find-and-copy model often assumed in the literature and identifies four distinct subprocesses involved: identification, translation, adoption, and continuation. This process model adds to understanding of vicarious learning by showing that it is a more varied process than it is commonly construed to be and that not only experience-seeking groups, but also groups that are the source of the experience, play important and shifting roles throughout. Thus, this study contributes to theories about how groups change their routines by elucidating how they alter their routines through vicarious learning.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0725","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['vicarious learning', 'group routines', 'experience']","The article discusses group learning processes and how they can change routines based on shared experiences, which touches on collaborative and inclusive practices.

An explorative analysis of 67 European insurance companies between 1995 and 2004 reveals that corporate strategic changes occur in four distinct rhythms, which are classified as either regular or irregular (focused, punctuated, and temporarily switching). Subsequent quantitative analysis shows that companies that change regularly outperform those that change irregularly. This finding prevails under different internal and external contingencies, under different change characteristics, and over time periods.

They face unintended consequences of that institutional complexity, however, which may impede their efforts. Past scholars have emphasized conflicting external demands, and competing internal claims on organizational identity. Data from an in-depth field study of the public-private Cambridge Energy Alliance suggest another consequence: paradoxes of performing (Smith & Lewis, 2011) that generate ambiguity about whether certain organizational outcomes represent success or failure. This article develops a process model of navigating such paradoxes: in sensemaking about paradoxical outcomes, actors grapple with definition of success and can transform the organizational logic. The result can be oscillation among logics, or novel synthesis between them when outside perspectives enable a clearer view of the paradox. Hybrid organizations' capacity for innovation depends in part on the results of this change process.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0772","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['innovation', 'organizational identity', 'institutional logics']","The article discusses hybrid organizations and their capacity for innovation through navigating complex institutional logics, which hints at themes of organizational identity and change.

We analyzed interview and network data from the head office of a recruiting agency. We found that managers active in the provision of emotion help thought of such help as over and above their managerial duties, whereas employees defined emotional support as managerial in-role behavior. Both parties accepted the necessity of controlling negative emotions for the good of the organization. But those being helped tended to perceive their helpers as doubly powerful figures, invested with both formal authority and parental authority, whereas the helpers saw themselves as reacting to situational contingencies to do favors for subordinates in need. Our results point to an emergent understanding of discrepant interpretations. Employees treat caring as part of the managers' role that requires no reciprocation, whereas managers see such help-giving as discretionary extra-role behavior that requires reciprocated commitment. Discrepant expectations concerning emotion helping leads to positive outcomes (e.g., managers being attributed leadership qualities by subordinates) but also negative outcomes (e.g., managers feeling disappointed at the lack of reciprocity).

This transfer is more pronounced when a subsidiary is apparently unconnected to an MNE, yet is controlled by an MNE's headquarters through the appointment of the subsidiary's board members; the institutional environment of the MNE's home country enforces compliance; and the degree of institutional enforcement, vigilance, and sanctions for noncompliance in the subsidiary's host country is low.

We refine the BAM's original formulation and provide an explanation for previous conflicting empirical results by theorizing that the anticipation of prospective wealth attenuates the negative effect of accumulated current equity wealth upon CEO strategic risk taking. In doing so, we offer an advancement of the dialectic between: (1) classical agency scholars, arguing that equity-based pay leads to more risk taking, and (2) behavioral scholars, arguing that equity wealth creates risk bearing, leading to less risk taking. We also suggest that the influences of prospective wealth and current wealth on strategic risk taking depend on the extent to which agents can manage the risk inherent in their compensation package and agent vulnerability to losses.

Building on this, we argue that actual quality mediates the effect of reputation on revenues more than the effect of status on revenues. Moreover, reputation and status have different effects on how organizations acquire resources: when their product quality is low relative to their aspiration level, organizations will display a preference for recruiting high-reputation resource providers over high-status ones. Conversely, organizations will display a preference for recruiting high-status resource providers over high-reputation ones when their revenue is low relative to their aspiration level. Finally, although both reputation and status have positive effects on the price paid for a resource, we argue that the relationship between reputation and pay is weaker for high-status resource providers.

Empirical results based on longitudinal performance data from 60 teams suggest that teams led by a directive leader initially outperform those led by an empowering leader. However, despite lower early performance, teams led by an empowering leader experience higher performance improvement over time because of higher levels of team learning, coordination, empowerment, and mental model development. Implications for current and future team leadership research are discussed.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.0132","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['empowering', 'leadership', 'team development', 'team learning']","The article discusses empowering leadership, which aligns with themes of diversity and inclusion in management practices.

Drawing on interviews with employees, we present a model of authenticity that begins with the salience of a customer's nonservice identity characteristics and an employee's identification with his or her task, both of which generate a sense of autonomy in employees. This psychological autonomy enhances the behavioral expression of authenticity, though such expression may yield costs involving loss of resources. Authenticity is reflected in uncalculated honesty, viewing a task as a personal endeavor, and conveying distinctive interpersonal closeness to customers.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.0252","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['authenticity', 'identity', 'autonomy']","The article discusses themes of authenticity and identity in service encounters, which align with moderate woke themes related to individual expression and psychological autonomy.

By building on research that emphasizes the dark sides of extraversion and the bright sides of neuroticism, we challenge the persistence of extraverts' advantage and neurotics' disadvantage in task group status hierarchies. In a field and an experimental study, we find that extraversion is associated with status losses and disappointing expectations for contributions to group tasks and neuroticism is associated with status gains due to surpassing expectations for group-task contributions. Whereas personality may inform status expectations through perceptions of competence when groups first form, as group members work together interdependently over time, actual contributions to the group's task are an important basis for reallocating status.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.0316","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['status', 'personality', 'group-task', 'contributions']","The article discusses personality traits and their impact on status allocation within groups, which touches on themes of social dynamics.

Certifications provide reputational benefits that increase stakeholders' confidence in a firm's prospects, thereby increasing the firm's ability to garner critical resources. Yet the influences that certifications have on rivals remain underexamined. This study investigates how the scientific and regulatory certifications that a firm receives affect rivals' entries into a new technical field it pioneers. I demonstrate that certifications have a dual role in shaping an emerging competitive landscape: Whereas a pioneer's scientific and regulatory certifications attract competition by indicating value creation prospects, its certification advantage over rivals deflects competitive entries by indicating bleaker value capture prospects. This study also shows that the influences stemming from a pioneer's certifications diminish as the innovation it pioneers receives certifications, thus providing rivals with more direct cues about a new field's prospects. In contrast with prior research showing that the emergence of a new technical field carries drastic implications for rivals, this study highlights how social context guides rivals' responses to an otherwise disruptive change, thereby shaping the patterns of technological evolution.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.0459","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['certifications', 'stakeholders', 'social context']","The article discusses certifications and their impact on competition and stakeholder confidence, which hints at broader social implications.

In particular, we suggest that signals associated with (i) a new venture's affiliations with venture capitalists (VCs) that have prominent positions in syndicate networks and (ii) a new venture's prominent position in alliance networks resulting from previous alliances offer redundant benefits. As a result, the positive effect of VC prominence in determining a new venture's future alliance formation diminishes as the new venture's prominence in alliance networks increases.

We characterize three types of dyadic ownership-status relationships and examine their relative mixes at the group level: (1) power source match (A's ownership and status are both higher than those of B); (2) ownership-dominated power source mismatch (A's ownership advantage over B is greater than B's status advantage over A); and (3) status-dominated power source mismatch (A's ownership advantage over B is less than B's status advantage over A). We found that power source match enhanced the effectiveness of venture capital (VC) syndication, and that ownership-dominated power source mismatch strengthened the positive effect of power source match because the syndicate could maintain legitimate ownership order and benefit from diverse inputs. By contrast, status-dominated power source mismatch weakened the positive effect of power source match, because it may have created disorderly interaction. Moreover, familiarity between participating VC firms diminished the negative moderating effect of status-dominated mismatch, because mutual trust helped organize group interaction, and entrepreneurial performance fulfilled a similar function, as the autonomy of entrepreneurs from the VC syndicate buffered turbulences caused by interaction problems among VC investors.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0832","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['power', 'ownership', 'status', 'diverse inputs', 'interorganizational relations']","The article discusses power dynamics and their impact on interorganizational relations, which touches on themes of equity and diversity in the context of venture capital.

Our conceptual framework suggests how disadvantages in the receipt of mentoring regarding prevailing norms in the corporate elite are negatively affecting the ability of women and minorities to secure multiple board appointments. Our theory explains why women and minority first-time directors receive comparatively less mentoring regarding a core norm in the corporate elite that outside directors should avoid exercising independent control over firm strategy. Our theory also explains why lower levels of mentoring result in women and racial minority first-time directors receiving relatively fewer appointments to other boards. This study also contributes to the corporate leadership literature by explaining how fundamental intergroup biases are negatively impacting the demographic diversity of the corporate elite.

U.S. Army soldiers were examined at the beginning, middle, and end of an intensive, 14-week residential entry program of training and collective socialization. Cross-lagged structural equation analyses supported a causal relationship of individuals' cognition-based trust with affect-based trust directed toward their unit peers and, separately, their leaders. Individuals with high levels of chronic relational identity exhibited a stronger time-lagged relationship between cognition-based trust and affect-based trust for trust in peers but not for trust in a leader. Affect-based trust in the leader had lagged influences on organizational identification and role-related performance at time 3.

Relying on an inductive comparative case study of four work integration social enterprises embedded in competing social welfare and commercial logics, we show that, instead of adopting strategies of decoupling or compromising, as the literature typically suggests, these organizations selectively coupled intact elements prescribed by each logic. This strategy allowed them to project legitimacy to external stakeholders without having to engage in costly deceptions or negotiations. We further identify a specific hybridization pattern that we refer to as \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d whereby organizations that entered the work integration field with low legitimacy because of their embeddedness in the commercial logic strategically incorporated elements from the social welfare logic in an attempt to gain legitimacy and acceptance. Surprisingly, they did so more than comparable organizations originating from the social welfare logic. These findings suggest that, when lacking legitimacy in a given field, hybrids may manipulate the templates provided by the multiple logics in which they are embedded in an attempt to gain acceptance.

In response to the recognition of these potential costs, professionals are motivated to manage role-based images and client evaluations through specific problem-focused image management tactics.

We test this model in three independent studies with data collected at multiple time periods. Study 1 employed a time-lagged research design with actual job seekers. Findings showed that justice perceptions associated with recruitment interactions influence attraction to an organization indirectly and directly via positive relational certainty (i.e., reduced uncertainty regarding how organizational relations might be upon entering the organization). Study 2 used a controlled experimental design to provide additional evidence of the relational certainty mechanism through which justice signals influence attraction. Finally, Study 3 incorporated a longitudinal (repeated-measures) design to examine reactions to recruitment interactions over ten weeks.

Building on moral self-regulation theory (Bandura, 1991), we propose that entrepreneurs' assessments of the attractiveness of opportunities that harm the natural environment depend on the simultaneous impact of values and personal agency. By cognitively disengaging their pro-environmental values, decision makers (i.e., entrepreneurs) can (under certain circumstances) perceive opportunities that harm the environment as highly attractive and thus suitable for exploitation. The results of a judgment task that generated 1,264 opportunity assessments nested within 83 business founders offered support for this general prediction and indicated that the extent of founders' disengagement of their pro-environmental values was stronger when they had high, rather than low, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and stronger when industry munificence was perceived as low rather than high.

Yet the very emotions that spur employees to express voice may compromise their ability to do so constructively, preventing managers from reacting favorably. I propose that to speak up frequently and constructively, employees need knowledge about effective strategies for managing emotions. Building on theories of emotion regulation, I develop a theoretical model that explains the role of managing emotions in the incidence and outcomes of voice. In a field study at a health care company, emotion regulation knowledge (1) predicted more frequent voice, (2) mediated by the emotional labor strategies of deep acting and surface acting, and (3) enhanced the contributions of voice to performance evaluations. These results did not generalize to helping behaviors, demonstrating that emotion regulation uniquely affects challenging but not affiliative interpersonal citizenship behaviors.

These conditions are (1) the firm's ex ante market position; (2) its ex ante resource base, which allows for complementarities; (3) its position in interorganizational networks, which gives it access to privileged information; and (4) the prior knowledge and experience of its managers, which allow superior judgment concerning the value-creating potential of the resource. These factors help explain why firms initially differ in how much value they attribute to a resource and, subsequently, why firms differ in their resource endowments. Our results also contribute to resource management theories by highlighting the role of managerial judgment in acquiring and accumulating resources and, thus, shaping firms' paths toward superior competitive positions. Furthermore, identifying firms' market positions and managerial judgment about demand-side value creation opportunities as resource value drivers highlights the importance of demand-side factors to strategic outcomes.

The Selective Revealing of Knowledge and Its Implications for Innovative Activity","Current theories of how organizations harness knowledge for innovative activity cannot convincingly explain emergent practices whereby firms selectively reveal knowledge to their advantage. We conceive of selective revealing as a strategic mechanism to reshape the collaborative behavior of other actors in a firm's innovation ecosystem. We propose that selective revealing may provide an effective alternative to known collaboration mechanisms, particularly under conditions of high partner uncertainty, high coordination costs, and unwilling potential collaborators. We specify conditions when firms are more likely to reveal knowledge and highlight some boundary conditions for competitor reciprocity. We elaborate on strategies that allow firms to exhibit managerial agency in selective revealing and discuss selective revealing's implications for theories of organization and open innovation and for management practice.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2011.0193","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge', 'collaboration', 'innovation']","The article discusses strategic mechanisms related to knowledge and collaboration but lacks a focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Mead's concept of role taking, with its strong emphasis on the relational aspect of agency, enables us to account for the fitting together of individual lines of action (performative) and the sharing of participants' schemata (included in the ostensive) as mutually constituted processes that occur as participants develop distinct selves in the context of a routine.

Alternatively, the \u201cmodel-theoretic\u201d perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment.

Family influence induces companies to strive for continuity, command, community, and connections and, thus, alters the mix of constraints under which firms operate. Consequently, family influence weakens several of the inertial forces described in the discontinuous change literature, particularly the level of formalization, dependence on external capital providers, and political resistance. However, it also aggravates critical sources of organizational paralysis, specifically emotional ties to existing assets and the rigidity of mental models. We aggregate these seemingly contradictory effects to show that, overall, discontinuous change conflicts with essential goals and values of the family system, and, therefore, family influence entails fundamentally different dilemmas than those described in extant research. In turn, although highly family-influenced companies recognize discontinuous technologies later than their less family-influenced counterparts, they implement adoption decisions more quickly and with more stamina. Moreover, family influence reduces adoption aggressiveness and flexibility. We discuss important implications of our research for conversations on discontinuous change as well as for the debate on the advantages and disadvantages of family influence in firms.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2011.0162","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","2","['family influence', 'discontinuous technologies', 'organizational paralysis']","The article discusses family influence on technology adoption but lacks a focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, which are central to 'woke' themes.

Although there is considerable scholarly work on rule-breaking, efforts to explain it remain theoretically fragmented. Here we identify two fundamental dimensions of bureaucratic rule-breaking and develop a coherent theoretical conception of it as a structurally patterned and interactionally mediated sociological fact. First, rule-breaking may be permitted or contested by those charged with rule enforcement. Manifestations of rule-breaking take on a routine character only where it is unofficially allowed; where it is not, conflict ensues. Second, the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy is mirrored by an organizational hierarchy of rule-breaking. Rule-breaking can be undertaken by individuals acting alone, it can be coordinated by workgroups, or it can be organized by top management as a matter of unofficial policy. Considering how these two dimensions of rule-breaking interact provides insight into how such actions vary with respect to the full range of organizational cross-pressures. Finally, the framework we develop offers an important corrective to the overreliance on the formal aspects of Weber's theorizing about bureaucracy and has considerable utility for generating hypotheses across an array of institutional arenas.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2011.0223","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","3","['rule-breaking', 'organizational scandals', 'bureaucracy']","The article discusses rule-breaking within organizations, particularly in the context of scandals and hierarchical structures.

In particular, online social networks present employees with boundary management and identity negotiation opportunities and challenges because they invite nontailored self-disclosure to broad audiences while offering few of the physical and social cues that normally guide social interactions. How and why do employees manage the boundaries between their professional and personal identities in online social networks, and how do these behaviors impact the way they are regarded by professional contacts? We build a framework to theorize about how work-nonwork boundary preferences and self-evaluation motives drive the adoption of four archetypical sets of online boundary management behaviors (open, audience, content, and hybrid) and the consequences of these behaviors for respect and liking in professional relationships. Content and hybrid behaviors are more likely to increase respect and liking than open and audience behaviors; audience and hybrid behaviors are less risky for respect and liking than open and content behaviors but more difficult to maintain over time.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2011.0235","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","4","['identity', 'boundary management', 'self-disclosure']","The article discusses the negotiation of professional and personal identities in online social networks, which touches on themes of identity and boundary management.

We propose that the dual forces of pressures and preferences vary from inclusion (e.g., incorporating the nonwork identity within the work identity) to exclusion (e.g., keeping the identities separate). We suggest that the alignment or misalignment of these pressures and preferences shapes people's experience of the power relationship between themselves and their organization/occupation and affects how they manage their nonwork identities.

Results show that philanthropic spending fluctuated dramatically as mega-events generally led to a punctuated increase in otherwise relatively stable patterns of giving by local corporations.

Firms\u2019 philanthropic history and communities\u2019 intercorporate network cohesion moderated some of these effects.

We examine the New York Clearing House Association (NYCHA), a private market-governance institution among commercial banks in Manhattan that operated from 1853 to 1913. We find that the NYCHA, founded to achieve coordinating benefits among banks and to limit the effect of financial panics, evolved at the turn of the twentieth century into a device for large, elite market players to promote their own interests to the disadvantage of rival groups that were not members.

We draw on authenticity research to theorize that the initial stage of socialization leads to more effective employment relationships when it instead primarily encourages newcomers to express their personal identities. In a field experiment carried out in a large business process outsourcing company in India, we found that initial socialization focused on personal identity (emphasizing newcomers\u2019 authentic best selves) led to greater customer satisfaction and employee retention after six months than socialization that focused on organizational identity (emphasizing the pride to be gained from organizational affiliation) or the organization\u2019s traditional approach, which focused primarily on skills training. To confirm causation and explore the mechanisms underlying the effects, we replicated the results in a laboratory experiment in a U.S. university. We found that individuals working temporarily as part of a research team were more engaged and satisfied with their work, performed their tasks more effectively, and were less likely to quit when initial socialization focused on personal identity rather than on organizational identity or a control condition.

While institutional theory presumes that professionals closely adhere to the logics of their professional groups, we find that actors exercise a great deal of agency in their everyday use of logics, both in terms of which logics they adopt and for what purpose. Available logics closely resemble tools that can be creatively employed by actors to achieve individual and organizational goals. A close analysis of court negotiations allowed us to identify the logics that are available to these actors, show how they are employed, and demonstrate how their use affects the severity of the court\u2019s decisions. We examine the ways in which professionals with four distinct logical orientations\u2014the logics of criminal punishment, rehabilitation, community accountability, and efficiency\u2014use logics to negotiate decisions in a drug court.

We use rich longitudinal data from 1974 to 2008 on the careers of Indian Administrative Service officers, members of the Republic of India\u2019s elite bureaucratic service, to test both these hypotheses. We find that specialization benefits officers throughout their career. We distinguish between skill-based and signal-based mechanisms that relate specialization to promotion, by exploring the match (or lack thereof) between the skills officers acquire and the jobs to which they are promoted, and we find that both mechanisms operate, but at different points in the career. Specialization is rewarded later in officers\u2019 careers because of the skills they acquire by specializing. Earlier in their careers, skills are less important; it appears that specialization benefits officers because it is a signal of general ability.

Organizational research suggests two such hazards: (1) opportunistic behaviors by elites that eventually lead to sanctions and (2) the targeting of elites by various audiences such that they are held more accountable than their lower-status counterparts for similar offenses. Our objective was to disentangle these two explanations in the context of an organizational scandal involving the Members of the British Parliament (MPs) whose annual expense claims were unexpectedly exposed in a well-known 2009 scandal. We find that high-status MPs were not more likely to abuse the expense system than were lower-status MPs, but they were more likely to be targeted by the press and voters for their inappropriate expense claims. As a consequence, high-status MPs were significantly more likely than non-elite MPs to exit Parliament when they had high levels of inappropriate expense claims. Elite MPs who were not implicated in the scandal, however, were far more likely to remain in Parliament than their lower-status counterparts. Our results also suggest that media coverage of the expense incident by British newspapers played a significant role in shaping social reactions to the scandal.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839213497011","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['accountability', 'scandal', 'elites', 'opportunistic behaviors']","The article discusses the accountability of high-status individuals in the context of a scandal, highlighting themes of social justice and the differential treatment of elites versus lower-status individuals.

We argue that prosocial claims operate as an impression management tactic meant to protect targeted firms by diluting the negative media attention attracted by the boycott. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 221 boycotts announced between 1990 and 2005. Results suggest that boycotted firms do significantly increase their prosocial claims activity after a boycott is announced. Firms are likely to react with a larger increase in prosocial claims when the boycott is more threatening (it receives more media attention), when the firm has a higher reputation, or when the firm engaged in more prosocial claims before the boycott. We demonstrate that firms fall back on their established impression management strategies when they face a reputational threat and will increase these previously perfected performances as the threat increases. In this way, the severity of a threat positively moderates the relationship between a firm\u2019s prior performance repertoire and future performance repertoire, a mechanism we refer to as \u201cthreat amplification.\u201d When an organization with high reputational standing has bolstered its position by using prosocial claims in its past performance repertoire, however, it will perceive itself to be shielded from movement attacks, decreasing the likelihood of any defensive response, a mechanism we call \u201cbuffering.\u201d Our findings contribute to impression management by exploring the use of impression management in response to a movement attack and highlighting the important role that a firm\u2019s pre-threat positioning plays in its response to an image threat.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839213500032","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['prosocial claims', 'social movement', 'impression management', 'reputational threat']","The article discusses how firms respond to social movement boycotts by increasing their prosocial claims, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and ethical considerations.

We focus on multi-industry firms and competitive spillovers across markets, hypothesizing that these firms delegate most business-level decisions to subsidiaries but adapt to multimarket competition by limiting their subsidiaries\u2019 incentive and ability to make resource commitments by constraining the scope of decision rights and the available resources, a phenomenon that we refer to as \u201cconstrained delegation.\u201d Accordingly, the extent of multimarket contact in a given market (1) is associated with lower subsidiary discretion in decisions pertaining to resource commitments and (2) counteracts the tendency of internal capital markets to provide financial resources to subsidiaries that have a low market share or operate in high-growth industries. Results of analyses, based on the population of majority-owned subsidiaries of groups operating in France between 1997 and 2004, support the predictions. We also found that multimarket contact is associated with a subsidiary\u2019s being even less competitively aggressive when the organization\u2019s design imposes more constraints on the subsidiary\u2019s resource allocations.

In contrast, the effect of the proportion of female managers on the number of new management jobs filled by men is positive initially but plateaus and turns negative. In showing these influences on job creation, we highlight the dynamic and socially influenced nature of jobs themselves: new jobs are created regularly in firms and not merely as a response to technical and administrative imperatives.

We then theorize how distinct voice flows should be differentially related to unit performance based on these core characteristics and test our hypotheses using time-lagged field data from 801 employees and their managers in 93 units across nine North American credit unions. Results demonstrate that voice flows are positively related to a unit\u2019s effectiveness when they are targeted at the focal leader of that unit\u2014who should be able to take action\u2014whether from that leader\u2019s own subordinates or those in other units, and negatively related to a unit\u2019s effectiveness when they are targeted at coworkers who have little power to effect change.

Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Na\u00efve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0461","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['social influence', 'adoption', 'probabilities']","The article focuses on technical aspects of predicting adoption probabilities in social networks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we complement an emerging body of research on the engineering of word-of-mouth effects by exploring a different angle through which firms can strategically exploit the value-generation potential of the user network. Namely, we consider how software firms should optimize the strength of network effects at utility level by adjusting the level of embedded social media features in tandem with the right market seeding and pricing strategies in the presence of seeding disutility. We explore two opposing seeding cost models where seeding-induced disutility can be either positively or negatively correlated with customer type. We consider both complete and incomplete information scenarios for the firm. Under complete information, we uncover a complementarity relationship between seeding and building social media features that holds for both disutility models. When the cost of any of these actions increases, rather than compensating by a stronger action on the other dimension to restore the overall level of network effects, the firm will actually scale back on the other initiative as well. Under incomplete information, this complementarity holds when seeding disutility is negatively correlated with customer type but may not always hold in the other disutility model, potentially leading to fundamentally different optimal strategies. We also discuss how our insights apply to asymmetric networks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0463","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of network effects and market strategies without addressing social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Therefore, understanding what types of content users generate and the underlying motivational factors is vital to the success of the sites. The extant research on content generation has primarily focused on the amount of content and on how to encourage participation in content creation, and less attention has been paid to the content itself and how social relations affect the types of content that users upload. This study aims to empirically document the relationship between social ties and the similarities between the types of content that people create online. We collected a large data set from the photo-hosting website Flickr detailing the users' social relations over time in conjunction with their photo-uploading behavior. We found that around the time of the formation of a social tie, members of dyads began to upload more similar photos than they did before that time. After a social tie was formed, this similarity evolved in different ways in different subgroups of dyads. Whereas the similarity between photos uploaded by dyads experiencing notably different popularity levels on the site continued to grow, the dyads of users with similar levels of popularity gradually began to upload less similar photos. In cultural production, individuals appear to present themselves as unique; this feature is more salient when the social contacts are similar in popularity status. Photo-shooting behaviors have been found to exhibit the same patterns. Furthermore, we show that the most divergent uploading behavior is observed when a high-popularity user initiates a tie with a user with lower popularity. We use social psychological motivations to explain these results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0464","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['social ties', 'content generation', 'social relations']","The article discusses social ties and their influence on content generation, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This result holds when we explore exogenous variation in social media policies, employees, and clients that are explained by medical marketing laws, medical malpractice laws, and distortions in Medicare incentives. Further examination suggests that content being generated mainly by employees can be avoided if a firm's postings are entirely client focused. However, most firm postings seem not to be specifically targeted to clients' interests, instead highlighting more general observations or achievements of the firm itself. We show that untargeted postings like these provoke activity by employees rather than clients.

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior.

A Game-Theoretical and Computational Analysis of the Combinatorial Clock Auction","Combinatorial auctions have been suggested as a means to raise efficiency in multi-item negotiations with complementarities among goods because they can be applied in procurement, energy markets, transportation, and the sale of spectrum auctions. The combinatorial clock (CC) auction has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CC+ auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CC+ auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0426","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of combinatorial auctions and efficiency in bidding strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Threatened by this growth, the information goods industry took legal action by suing the file sharing peer-to-peer networks and the consumers who illegally share copyrighted material on these networks. In this paper we demonstrate that each one of these two actions aimed to fight individual piracy can backfire by providing strategic disadvantage to legal publishers of information goods. In particular, we show that in the presence of commercial piracy (i) a higher population of consumers who are capable of individual piracy can increase a legal publisher's profits; and (ii) a higher detection and prosecution rate for individual piracy can reduce a legal publisher's profits. Both effects can be observed in markets where commercial piracy is suppressed because the legal publisher can be coerced to take a price cut to minimize the loss of market share. The latter effect can also be observed in markets with active commercial piracy presence because the legal publisher can be forced to raise prices and concede market share to piracy. Our results suggest that information goods producers may be better off by considering their copyright protection policies concerning individual piracy from a more strategic point of view.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0430","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['piracy', 'copyright', 'policy']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of copyright and piracy without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Practitioners have largely cited the issues related to control and ownership of IOS, referred to as IOS governance in this paper, as the key reason behind the failure of many IOS initiatives. We distinguish between two IOS governance modes, transactional and financial, and develop a mediated-moderation model to explain the factors influencing the governance choices. In our model, the key motivators of IOS governance are the criticality and the replaceability of the resources that firms procure, which affect IOS governance through their influence on the degree of operational integration existing between partners. We hypothesize that while resource criticality will increase the needs for financial and transactional governance because of its positive impact on operational integration, resource replaceability will negatively influence governance needs because of its negative impact on operational integration. Furthermore, technological uncertainty associated with the resources is argued to negatively impact the extent of IOS governance exercised by firms by weakening the positive impact of resource criticality and strengthening the negative impact of resource replaceability on operational integration respectively. We empirically test our model using data gathered from a survey of 159 United States manufacturing firms. Results show that resource criticality positively affects the extent of financial and transactional IOS governance by increasing the need for operational integration, whereas resource replaceability negatively affects them by reducing the need for operational integration. Furthermore, technological uncertainty creates disincentives for IOS governance primarily by weakening the positive influence of resource criticality on operational integration, while no statistically significant effect of technological uncertainty on the relationship between resource replaceability and operational integration was discerned.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0432","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of governance in interorganizational information systems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine this issue in the context of pricing of wireless services: should the price be based on the service, e.g., voice, multimedia messages, short messages, or should it be based on the traffic generated? Many consumer advocates oppose discriminatory pricing across services believing that it enriches carriers at the expense of consumers. The opposition to discrimination has grown significantly, and it has even prompted the U.S. Congress to question executives of some of the biggest carriers. With this ongoing debate on discrimination in mind, we compare two pricing regimes here. One regime, namely, service pricing, involves pricing different services differently. The other one, namely, traffic pricing, involves pricing the traffic (i.e., bytes) transmitted. We show why the common wisdom, that discriminatory pricing across services increases profits and harms consumers, may not always hold. We also show that such discrimination can increase social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0434","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['consumer advocates', 'discriminatory pricing', 'social welfare']","The article discusses the implications of discriminatory pricing and its effects on consumers, highlighting a concern for social welfare.

Though substantial evidence suggests that diversity has profound implications for a variety of outcomes including performance, member engagement, and withdrawal behavior, the effects of diversity have been predominantly investigated in the context of organizational workgroups or virtual teams. We use a diversity lens to study the success of nontraditional virtual work groups exemplified by open source software (OSS) projects. Building on the diversity literature, we propose that three types of diversity (separation, variety, and disparity) influence two critical outcomes for OSS projects: community engagement and market success. We draw on the OSS literature to further suggest that the effects of diversity on market success are moderated by the application development stage. We instantiate the operational definitions of three forms of diversity to the unique context of open source projects. Using archival data from 357 projects hosted on SourceForge, we find that disparity diversity, reflecting variation in participants' contribution-based reputation, is positively associated with success. The impact of separation diversity, conceptualized as culture and measured as diversity in the spoken language and country of participants, has a negative impact on community engagement but an unexpected positive effect on market success. Variety diversity, reflected in dispersion in project participant roles, positively influences community engagement and market success. The impact of diversity on market success is conditional on the development stage of the project. We discuss how the study's findings advance the literature on antecedents of OSS success, expand our theoretical understanding of diversity, and present the practical implications of the results for managers of distributed collectives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0435","","ISR","Information Systems","7","['diversity', 'community engagement', 'market success', 'open source', 'nontraditional']","The article emphasizes the importance of diversity in open source projects and its implications for community engagement and market success, reflecting a focus on social dynamics within technology.

The internal information associated with disclosures may be positive or negative. In this paper, we evaluate how the nature of the disclosed security risk factors, believed to represent the firm's internal information regarding information security, is associated with future breach announcements reported in the media. For this purpose, we build a decision tree model, which classifies the occurrence of future security breaches based on the textual contents of the disclosed security risk factors. The model is able to accurately associate disclosure characteristics with breach announcements about 77% of the time. We further explore the contents of the security risk factors using text-mining techniques to provide a richer interpretation of the results. The results show that the disclosed security risk factors with risk-mitigation themes are less likely to be related to future breach announcements. We also investigate how the market interprets the nature of information security risk factors in annual reports. We find that the market reaction following the security breach announcement is different depending on the nature of the preceding disclosure. Thus, our paper contributes to the literature in information security and sheds light on how market participants can better interpret security risk factors disclosed in financial reports at the time when financial reports are released.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0437","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['disclosure', 'risk factors', 'security breaches']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of information security and market reactions to disclosures, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

To better understand the more nuanced aspects of the relationship, we formulated a bidirectional and time-lagged model that incorporates different perspectives from organizational theories and transaction cost economics. Our two models\u2014the bidirectional and one-year lagged model and the bidirectional and two-year lagged model\u2014were tested using nine-year panel data on IT spending, IT stock, coordination costs, firm size, and relevant control variables for 277 manufacturing firms. We found a sequential interaction between IT and firm size in both of the two models: as a firm grows in size, its coordination activities increase; the firm then uses more IT to handle the increased activities of coordination; this increased use of IT, in turn, decreases coordination costs, and eventually, the size of the firm decreases. It was also found that the presence of coordination costs is necessary for the sequential interaction between IT and firm size, indicating coordination between and within firms is a major reason for firms to invest in IT and for IT effect to take place on firm size. This study has taken an initial step by attempting to empirically examine dual causality and longitudinal effects between IT and firm size, and to reconcile different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between them. We hope this work can act as a catalyst for developing a better understanding of the complex relationship between IT and organizations, with the ultimate goal of offering robust prescriptions for successful structural change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0439","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical relationship between information technology and firm size without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

E-tailers can track items in online shopping carts and radio frequency identification tags enable retailers to do the same in brick-and-mortar stores. To leverage this information, it is important to understand how this new visibility impacts pricing and market outcomes. We propose a model in which a seller sets prices for goods A and B, allowing for the possibility of sequentially revising the price for good B if the buyer reveals a preference for good A by making an initial purchase decision. We derive comparative statics results for the prices of products that have superadditive or subadditive values, and also for the associated profits. We also run simulations for a range of distributions of buyer values, to compare sequential pricing with mixed bundling. The results indicate that information technology-enabled sequential pricing can increase profits relative to mixed bundling or pure components pricing for substitute goods due to a reduction of intraseller competition. We also consider the case of goods with positively or negatively correlated values and find that when sellers can condition the second good's price on the buyer's decision to purchase the first good, sequential pricing increases profits when customer's values for the goods are highly positively correlated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0440","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and market outcomes without any reference to social themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

To better understand this phenomenon, we extend previous theorizing by including the concepts of the episode initiator (whether the second conversation was focal or partner initiated), the fit of the set of media used in the episode, one process gain (conversation leveraging), and process losses. Employing a series of pilot studies and a main study, the resulting model was analyzed using structural equation modeling, finding overall support for the model. Findings suggest that experienced intensity is an important factor influencing process losses experienced during multicommunicating, whereas episode initiator influences process losses and the process gain. Further, media fit moderates the relationship between intensity and process losses.

Nevertheless, efforts are often private and thus both firms and MSSPs can suffer from double moral hazard. Furthermore, the double moral hazard problem in security outsourcing is complicated by the existence of strong externality and the multiclient nature of MSSP services. In this prescriptive research, we first show that the prevailing contract structure in security outsourcing, bilateral refund contract, cannot solve double moral hazard. Adding breach-contingent sunk cost or external payment cannot solve double moral hazard either. Furthermore, positive externality can worsen double moral hazard. We then propose a new contract structure termed multilateral contract and show that it can solve double moral hazard and induce first-best efforts from all contractual parties when an MSSP serves two or more client firms, regardless of the externality. Firm-side externality significantly affects how payments flow under a multilateral contract when a security breach happens. When the number of client firms for an MSSP increases, we show that the contingent payments under multilateral contracts for any security breach scenario can be easily calculated using an additive method, and thus are computationally simple to implement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0447","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['moral hazard', 'security outsourcing', 'contract structure']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of information security and contract structures without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications in a broader societal context.

Because competition can be a driver of efficiency and industries display varying degrees of competitiveness, firm-level efficiency is likely to display considerable heterogeneity. To shed light on these questions, we analyze the economic impact of IT on technical efficiency, a key component of efficiency, in heterogeneous competitive settings. Our study employs a number of econometric techniques, including a stochastic frontier and a generalized method of moments approach, on data from firms in a wide cross-section of industries. We find, after controlling for firm-level heterogeneity and potential endogeneity, that IT is positively associated with gains in technical efficiency but its impact is moderated by the degree of competition. Firms display large variation in their levels of technical efficiency partly because of the heterogeneous market competitiveness conditions they face. In more competitive industries, firms tend to deploy IT more intensively and use it more efficiently. Our study makes a distinct contribution relative to prior studies that have focused on the productivity impacts of IT while assuming perfect competition and not allowing for potential heterogeneity in firm-level efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that IT and competition are significant determinants of gains in technical efficiency and provide insight into how competition affects the returns to IT investment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0438","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical efficiency and the impact of information technology within competitive settings, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Nonetheless, it has been observed that individuals' behavior is at times inconsistent with their privacy concerns, e.g., they disclose substantial private information in synchronous online social interactions, even though they are aware of the risks involved. Drawing on the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective, this paper elucidates the interesting roles of privacy concerns and social rewards in synchronous online social interactions by examining the causes and the behavioral strategies that individuals utilize to protect their privacy. An empirical study involving 251 respondents was conducted in online chat rooms. Our results indicate that individuals utilize both self-disclosure and misrepresentation to protect their privacy and that social rewards help explain why individuals may not behave in accordance with their privacy concerns. In addition, we find that perceived anonymity of others and perceived intrusiveness affect both privacy concerns and social rewards. Our findings also suggest that higher perceived anonymity of self decreases individuals' privacy concerns, and higher perceived media richness increases social rewards. Generally, this study contributes to the information systems literature by integrating the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective to identify antecedents of privacy trade-off and predict individuals' behavior in synchronous online social interactions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0441","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'social rewards', 'self-disclosure', 'misrepresentation']","The article addresses privacy concerns and protective behaviors in online interactions, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations related to personal data.

However, despite a great deal of research on when and why systems are used, very little research has examined what effective system use involves and what drives it. To move from use to effective use requires understanding an information system's nature and purpose, which in turn requires a theory of information systems. We draw on representation theory, which states that an information system is made up of several structures that serve to represent some part of the world that a user and other stakeholders must understand. From this theory, we derive a high-level framework of how effective use and performance evolve, as well as specific models of the nature and drivers of effective use. The models are designed to explain the effective use of any information system and offer unique insights that would not be offered by traditional views, which tend to consider information systems to be just another tool. We explain how our theory extends existing research, provides a rich platform for research on effective use, and how it contributes back to the theory of information systems from which it was derived.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0444","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['effective use', 'stakeholders', 'theory']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of information systems and their effective use without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

This study extends prior research on online decision aids by investigating the effects of a decision aid's user-system interaction mode (USIM), which can be either user-guided or system-controlled, on users' effort-related (number of iterations of using the aid and perceived cognitive effort expended in using it) and quality-related (perceived quality of the aid and acceptance of the product advice it provides) assessments. A contingency approach with two moderating factors is employed. One factor is the decision strategy (additive-compensatory or elimination) employed by the aid, and the other is the users' product knowledge (high or low). A laboratory experiment was conducted to compare online decision aids with different USIMs. Although the results largely confirm that users assess the user-guided USIM more positively than the system-controlled USIM, the effects of USIM are stronger in two settings: for the elimination-based aid than for the additive-compensatory-based aid and for users with low product knowledge than for those with high product knowledge, especially in terms of effort assessments. This research advances the theoretical understanding of the effects of interaction between two critical components of online decision aids (USIMs and decision strategies) and the moderating role of user characteristics (product knowledge) in affecting users' evaluations. It also provides practitioners with design advice for developing these aids.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0445","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['user-system interaction', 'user-guided', 'system-controlled']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of online decision aids and user interaction modes without significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We adapt and extend the heterogeneous diffusion model from sociology and examine the conditions under which prior adopters of competing open source software (OSS) licenses socially influence how a new OSS project chooses among such licenses and how the experiences of the project manager of a new OSS project with particular licenses affects its susceptibility to this social influence. We test our predictions using a sample of 5,307 open source projects hosted at SourceForge. Our results suggest the most important factor determining a new project's license choice is the type of license chosen by existing projects that are socially closer to it in its inter-project social network. Moreover, we find that prior adopters of a particular license are more infectious in their influence on the license choice of a new project as their size and performance rankings increase. We also find that managers of new projects who have been members of more successful prior OSS projects and who have greater depth and diversity of experience in the OSS community are less susceptible to social influence. Finally, we find a project manager is more likely to adopt a particular license type when his or her project occupies a similar social role as other projects that have adopted the same license.

The unique properties of on-demand services are the conversion of fixed costs to variable costs, removal of capacity constraint, and fast setup time (which enables quick entry by any firm at any time when there is opportunity), whereas privacy and security concerns and switching costs have been noted as the biggest barriers from adopting on-demand services. With a stylized model capturing these benefits and barriers to using on-demand services, we establish several results. First, we show that conversion of fixed cost to variable cost enables new and small firms to enter existing markets and leads to the creation of new markets. Second, we show that competition and the threat of new entrants can be an important driver of a firm's decision to switch to on-demand services. In addition, a firm's barriers to using on-demand services can influence another firm's entry decision. Third, we show that two identical firms may employ different technologies in equilibrium. Fourth, we show that fast setup time and removal of capacity constraint associated with on-demand services make it impossible for firms to make supranormal return and would lead to a perfect competitive market, even when there is only one firm, under very general conditions. Such a result still holds even when there exists an economy of scale (e.g., quantity discount) from using on-demand services. On the other hand, when there are barriers preventing firms from offering similar products and products are substantially differentiated, on-demand services can amplify this advantage of entry barriers by enabling firms to further increase prices and enhance their profitability. Therefore, contrary to the common belief that offering on-demand services is best for firms offering commodity products, we show on-demand services to be more profitable for firms with differentiated products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0451","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['privacy', 'security', 'consumer welfare']","The article discusses privacy and security concerns as barriers to adopting on-demand services, which touches on ethical considerations but primarily focuses on market structure and profitability.

This flexibility in the bidding languages and the allocation constraints is essential in these domains but has not been considered in the theoretical literature so far. In this paper, we analyze different pricing rules for ascending combinatorial auctions that allow for such flexibility: winning levels and deadness levels. We determine the computational complexity of these pricing rules and show that deadness levels actually satisfy an ex post equilibrium, whereas winning levels do not allow for a strong game theoretical solution concept. We investigate the relationship of deadness levels and the simple price update rules used in efficient ascending combinatorial auction formats. We show that ascending combinatorial auctions with deadness level pricing rules maintain a strong game theoretical solution concept and reduce the number of bids and rounds required at the expense of higher computational effort. The calculation of exact deadness levels is a -complete problem. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that for mid-sized auctions this is a feasible approach.

We show that (1) ranking effects are higher on mobile phones suggesting higher search costs: links that appear at the top of the screen are especially likely to be clicked on mobile phones and (2) the benefit of browsing for geographically close matches is higher on mobile phones: stores located in close proximity to a user's home are much more likely to be clicked on mobile phones.

This supports meaningful Web browsing and searching by information consumers. It also allows topical Web crawlers, programs that fetch pages by following hyperlinks, to harvest topical subsets of the Web for applications such as those in vertical search and business intelligence. We show that the Web exhibits another property that we call \u201cstatus locality.\u201d It is based on the notion that pages tend to link to other pages of similar status (importance) and that this status similarity also decays rapidly with link distance. Analogous to topical locality, status locality may also be exploited by Web crawlers. Collections built by such crawlers include pages that are both topically relevant and also important. This capability is crucial because of the large numbers of Web pages addressing even niche topics. The challenge in exploiting status locality while crawling is that page importance (or status) is typically recognized through global measures computed by processing link data from billion of pages. In contrast, topical Web crawlers depend on local information based on previously downloaded pages. We solve this problem by using methods developed previously that utilize local characteristics of pages to estimate their global status. This leads to the design of new crawlers, specifically of utility-biased crawlers guided by a Cobb-Douglas utility function. Our crawler experiments show that status and topicality of Web collections present a trade-off. An adaptive version of our utility-biased crawler dynamically modifies output elasticities of topicality and status to create Web collections that maintain high average topicality. This can be done while simultaneously achieving significantly higher average status as compared to several benchmarks including a state-of-the-art topical crawler.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0457","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of web crawling and information retrieval without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As the economic potential of these markets is now being realized, they are beginning to go mainstream, a trend reflected by the explicit attention crowdfunding has received in the American Jobs Act as a potential avenue for economic growth, as well as the recent focus that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have placed upon it. Although the formulation of regulation and policy surrounding crowd-funded markets is becoming increasingly important, the behavior of crowdfunders, an important aspect that must be considered in this formulation effort, is not yet well understood. A key factor that can influence the behavior of crowd funders is information on prior contribution behavior, including the amount and timing of others' contributions, which is published for general consumption. With that in mind, in this study, we empirically examine social influence in a crowd-funded marketplace for online journalism projects, employing a unique data set that incorporates contribution events and Web traffic statistics for approximately 100 story pitches. This data set allows us to examine both the antecedents and consequences of the contribution process. First, noting that digital journalism is a form of public good, we evaluate the applicability of two competing classes of economic models that explain private contribution toward public goods in the presence of social information: substitution models and reinforcement models. We also propose a new measure that captures both the amount and the timing of others' contribution behavior: contribution frequency (dollars per unit time). We find evidence in support of a substitution model, which suggests a partial crowding-out effect, where contributors may experience a decrease in their marginal utility from making a contribution as it becomes less important to the recipient. Further, we find that the duration of funding and, more importantly, the degree of exposure that a pitch receives over the course of the funding process, are positively associated with readership upon the story's publication. This appears to validate the widely held belief that a key benefit of the crowdfunding model is the potential it offers for awareness and attention-building around causes and ventures. This last aspect is a major contribution of the study, as it demonstrates a clear linkage between marketing effort and the success of crowd-funded projects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0468","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['crowdfunding', 'public good', 'social influence', 'contribution behavior']","The article discusses crowdfunding as a source of capital for public goods, hinting at social responsibility and community impact, which aligns with moderate woke themes.

With personalization being increasingly perceived as a source of competitive advantage, there is a growing trend toward pursuing technology-enabled personalization strategies in online retailing. However, the choice of a retailer whether or not to select into technology-enabled personalization and its implications for customer loyalty are at best ambiguous. This paper is an attempt to resolve this apparent ambiguity. Specifically, the paper conceptualizes retailer selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies relevant to two steps of an online purchase, namely, transaction personalization strategy and decision personalization strategy, based on the operating characteristics of a retailer. The implications of the retailers' self-selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies for customer loyalty are then empirically investigated with data collected from 422 retailers. Further, based on a counterfactual analysis, the paper reveals the implications of making a normatively incorrect decision with respect to personalization strategy. Contrary to popular belief, the results of this study indicate that personalization may not be uniformly beneficial in terms of customer loyalty to all retailers. Although a majority of retailers pursue transaction personalization and realize benefits by way of improved customer loyalty, we find that the choice of a retailer to pursue decision personalization is self-selected and dependent on idiosyncratic characteristics related to its operating context. Retailers that have relatively large-scale operations, provide greater variety and realize higher customer satisfaction with product selection, and that do not necessarily compete on price (i.e., realize lower customer satisfaction with prices relative to competing retailers) are more likely to pursue the decision personalization strategy. Although some retailers pursue decision personalization because they clearly stand to benefit from doing so, other retailers are better off not following suit. Theoretical contributions of the study, managerial implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0471","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['personalization', 'customer loyalty', 'normatively incorrect']","The article discusses personalization strategies and their implications for customer loyalty, but it does not emphasize social justice or critical theory.

An intriguing question is whether such sustained participation in OSS projects yields economic benefits to the participants. Moreover, as participants engage in OSS projects, they take on different roles and activities in the community. This raises additional questions of whether different forms of participation in OSS communities are associated with different economic rewards and, if so, in which contexts. In this paper, we draw upon theories of signaling and job matching to hypothesize that participants who possess \u201cproof\u201d of their skills in OSS projects are financially rewarded for their activities in the labor market. More specifically, we distinguish between participation in OSS communities that is associated with a signaling value for unobserved productivity characteristics and an additional value that accrues to participants whose OSS roles and activities match those in their paid employment. Following a cohort of OSS programmers over a six-year period, we empirically examine the wages and OSS performance of participants in three of the foremost OSS projects operating within the Apache Software Foundation. Controlling for individual characteristics and other wage-related factors, our findings reveal that credentials earned through a merit-based ranking system are associated with as much as an 18% increase in wages. Moreover, we find that participants who have OSS project management responsibilities receive additional financial rewards if their professional job is in IT management. These findings suggest that rank within an OSS meritocracy is a credible and precise signal of participants' productive capacity and that participants' roles and activities in an OSS community have additional financial value when aligned with their paid employment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0474","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['participation', 'economic benefits', 'OSS', 'meritocracy']","The article discusses participation in open source software communities and the economic returns associated with different roles, but it primarily focuses on economic benefits rather than social justice or equity themes.

The interdependencies pose significant challenges in designing appropriate incentives to influence a provider's effort-allocation decisions. By integrating process modeling fundamentals with multitask agency theory, we enumerate the base set of possible interrelationships among different IT service processes and derive corresponding optimal incentives. Our results demonstrate the impacts of risk profile, random noise, value-cost ratio, and process structure on optimal incentive rates. We find that the current practice of treating IT services as essentially independent is optimal only in limited settings where both the service provider and customer are risk neutral. Interestingly, incongruent performance measures require optimal incentive rates to respond in complex ways to the strength of coupling between services and the complementarity and substitutability of services. We also analyze more complex process scenarios using different combinations of the base set. The results demonstrate that, while the findings from the base set largely hold, the value-cost ratio of the services and the performance measure congruity can pose unique challenges in determining incentive rates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0475","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT infrastructure and incentive design without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, UA initiatives tend to focus on issues such as physical access and geographical ubiquity, and they measure adoption through penetration rates. In this paper, we apply an interpretive case study approach to analyze the Philadelphia wireless initiative to provide insights into the nature of UA and extend this concept to also consider universal use (UU). UU is important because simply providing access does not guarantee use. UU is presented as a conceptual goal that starts with the challenge of physical access, but which necessarily also leads to considerations of use. The results show that the human and technological elements underlying individual access and use are deeply embedded within various institutional elements and collectives that enable but also constrain meaningful use. We integrate our findings into a multilevel framework that shows how access and use are influenced by both micro and macro factors.

A growing body of research is examining these networks to gain a better understanding of how firms interact with their consumers, how people interact with each other, and how current and future digital artifacts will continue to alter business and society. The increasing availability of massive networked data has led to several streams of inquiry across fields as diverse as computer science, economics, information systems, marketing, physics, and sociology. Each of these research streams asks questions that at their core involve \u201cinformation in networks\u201d\u2014its distribution, its diffusion, its inferential value, and its influence on social and economic outcomes. We suggest a broad direction for research into social and economic networks. Our analysis describes four kinds of investigation that seem most promising. The first studies how information technologies create and reveal networks whose connections represent social and economic relationships. The second examines the content that flows through networks and its economic, social, and organizational implications. A third develops theories and methods to understand and utilize the rich predictive information contained in networked data. A final area of inquiry focuses on network dynamics and how information technology affects network evolution. We conclude by discussing several important cross-cutting issues with implications for all four research streams, which must be addressed if the ensuing research is to be both rigorous and relevant. We also describe how these directions of inquiry are interconnected: results and ideas will pollinate across them, leading to a new cumulative research tradition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0472","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['social', 'economic', 'networks', 'information', 'implications']","The article discusses the implications of digital technologies on social and economic networks, touching on themes of societal impact and the role of information in shaping relationships.

Outsourcing initiatives vary in terms of uncertainty in business requirements, complexity of coordination between the outsourcing firm and provider, and the consequent choice of the governing contract (fixed or variable price). Using theories from institutional economics, strategy, and information systems, we argue that firms pursuing large-scale, fixed price outsourcing, which are characterized by lower business uncertainty and simpler coordination requirements, will realize higher market returns relative to similar firms in the same industry who did not outsource. In contrast, variable price contracts that proxy for higher business uncertainty and coordination complexity may have a higher risk of failure and loss of shareholder value; however, prior outsourcing experience and prior association with the vendor may reduce uncertainty in the outsourcing relationship to help the outsourcing firm better manage challenges associated with complex, variable price engagements. We posit that financial markets are either not privy to or unlikely to accurately interpret such intangible information on the antecedents of outsourcing success during the announcement period. The delay in incorporation of this information in market prices results in positive long-term abnormal returns to fixed price contracts. Variable price contracts characterized by prior association between participant firms and greater outsourcing experience also realize positive long-term abnormal returns. Data on the hundred largest outsourcing initiatives implemented between 1996 and 2005 strongly support our hypotheses. The results imply that firms who retain simple functions and tasks in-house as well as those who outsource complex functions without pertinent experience or association with the vendor experience significant loss of shareholder value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0478","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of outsourcing contracts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay.

In this paper, we formalize the interaction effect of IT by focusing on one core function, namely, research and development (R&D). We hypothesize that investments in IT can interact with and complement a firm's R&D investments, enhancing the firm's shareholder value creation potential. We test this by hypothesis by estimating the interaction impact of IT and R&D investments on Tobin's q, a forward-looking measure of firm performance using a recent multiyear, firm-level, archival data set. Our results suggest that the interaction effect of R&D and IT on Tobin's q is positive and significant after controlling for other firm- and industry-specific effects. Our findings provide rigorous empirical support for recent anecdotal evidence in the managerial literature with respect to the manner in which IT is enabling R&D-intensive innovation processes.

In an empirical study of computer games development\u2014an arena in which the novelty and richness of the user experience is central to competitive success\u2014we identify the challenges of conceptualizing and realizing a desired user experience when it cannot be readily specified in an initial design template, nor represented within the expertise of existing groups.

Through this framework, we are able to show how achieving a desired user experience requires developer groups to not only work across the boundaries that arise from specialized expertise, but also across wider fields centred on cultural production and software development, respectively. We find that their ability to do this is supported by distinctive \u201cenvisioning practices\u201d that sustain an emerging shared \u201cvision\u201d for each game. The key research contributions that we then make are (a) grounding envisioning practices as a means of theorizing the collaborative practices centred on conceptualizing the user experience; (b) identifying how these practices are interwoven with the \u201cproducing practices\u201d of software development, thus enabling collaboration to span expert groups and disparate fields; and (c) theorizing the role of vision as an emerging conceptual boundary object in these practices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0482","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['culturally rich', 'user experience', 'collaborative practices', 'cultural production']","The article discusses the importance of culturally rich user experiences and collaborative practices in software development, indicating a moderate focus on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity.

Based on archival panel data on costs, operations, and patient care outcomes of 66 hospitals in the U.S. state of Washington from 1998 to 2007, we find that past HIT expenditure is negatively associated with MIP, supporting our argument that HIT provides value that is anticipated by insurers and is captured by a change in MIP. We find that past HIT is positively associated with quality of patient care. We also find that past MIP is positively associated with quality of patient care, supporting the premise that hospitals respond to MIP by making risk mitigation efforts.

Prior research on continued participation in online communities has primarily focused on social interactions among members and benefits obtained from these interactions. However, members of these communities often play different roles, which have been examined extensively, albeit in a separate stream of research. This study attempts to bridge these two streams of research by investigating the joint influence of community response and members' roles on continued participation. We categorize OSSD community members into users and modifiers and empirically examine the differential effects of community response across these roles. By analyzing a longitudinal data set of activities in the discussion forums of more than 300 OSSD projects, we not only confirm the positive influence of community response on members' continued participation but also find that community response is more influential in driving the continuance behavior of users than that of modifiers.

In recent years, firms motivated by revenues from software services markets have become the primary contributors to open-source development. In this paper we study the role of services in open source software development and explore the choice between open source and proprietary software. Specifically, our economic model jointly analyzes the investment and pricing decisions of the originators of software and of subsequent open-source contributors. We find that if a contributor is efficient in software development, the originator should adopt an open-source strategy, allowing the contributor to offer higher total quality and capture the higher end of the market while the originator focuses on providing software services to lower end consumers. Conversely, if the contributor is not efficient in development, the originator should adopt a proprietary software development strategy, gaining revenue from software sales and squeezing the contributor out of the services market. In certain cases an increase in originator development efficiency can result in increased contributor profits. Finally, we find that, somewhat counterintuitively, an increase in contributor development efficiency can reduce overall social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0486","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['open source', 'economic structure', 'social welfare']","The article primarily focuses on economic models and competitive strategies in open source software, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, a clear understanding of the relationship between these technologies and product returns is still lacking. Our study attempts to fill this gap by using several econometric models to explore the said relationship. Our unique and rich data set from a women's clothing company allows us to measure technology usage at the product level for each consumer. The results show that, in this context, zoom usage has a negative coefficient, suggesting that a higher use of the zoom technology is associated with fewer returns. Interestingly, we find that a higher use of alternative photos is associated with more returns and, perhaps more importantly, with lower net sales.

In RO literature, multistage investment programs have been treated as either interproject or intraproject programs, with intraproject programs being evaluated using n-fold Geske compound options and interproject programs valued using the so-called \u201csubsidy-to-exercise price\u201d logic. Our innovative RO model integrates the Geske compound option model with the subsidy-to-exercise price approach to value sequential investment programs that are neither purely interproject nor purely intraproject in nature but are composed of meta-stages. A meta-stage as a whole can be considered an interproject stage resulting in cash flows, but internally it consists of several intraproject stages that do not result in cash flows. We show that a key problem in IT, which is migrating to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for integrating a firm's many disparate applications, systems, data, and business processes, is best viewed as an investment program comprising meta-stages. Examining SOA migration from an RO lens is particularly apt at this time not only because of the importance of SOA but also because doubts have surfaced about the value of SOA. We illustrate our RO model by applying it to the simulated case of a firm migrating to SOA. We also develop a software tool based on the MathematicaTM computational platform so that practitioners can easily apply our innovative options pricing model to determine the true value of SOA in their business contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0488","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for valuing IT projects without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Stock message boards provide an excellent setting to analyze these issues given the large user base and market uncertainty. Using data from 502 investor responses from a field experiment on one of the largest message board operators in South Korea, our analyses revealed that investors exhibit confirmation bias, whereby they preferentially treat messages that support their prior beliefs. This behavior is more pronounced for investors with higher perceived knowledge about the market and higher strength of belief (i.e., sentiment) toward a particular stock. We also find a negative interaction effect between the perceived knowledge and the strength of prior belief on confirmation bias.

A Study of Anchoring Effects","Recommender systems are becoming a salient part of many e-commerce websites. Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, although behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2013.0497","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['consumer preferences', 'bias', 'trust']","The article discusses consumer preferences and bias in the context of recommender systems, which touches on ethical implications of technology use.

Information technologies are expected to be an important competency in the development of organizational agility. This research proposes two distinct roles to understand how information technology competencies shape organizational agility and firm performance. In their enabling role, IT competencies are expected to directly enhance entrepreneurial and adaptive organizational agility. In their facilitating role, IT competencies should enhance firm performance by helping the implementation of requisite entrepreneurial and adaptive actions. Furthermore, we argue that the effects of the dual roles of IT competencies are moderated by multiple contingencies arising from environmental dynamism and other sources. We test our model and hypotheses through a latent class regression analysis on data from a sample of 109 business-to-business electronic marketplaces. The results provide support for the enabling and facilitating roles of IT competencies. Moreover, we find that these dual effects vary according to environmental dynamism.

As under prevailing views, a retailer disclosing positive news risks entry by competitors. However, entry shifts the incumbent supplier\u2013retailer relationship: the presence of new competitors leads the supplier to treat its retailer more as a strategic partner, translating into lower wholesale prices. This, in turn, can lead the retailer to willingly share favorable news, since such disclosure invites entry precisely when the retailer stands to benefit most from price concessions.

CFOs believe that (i) above all, high-quality earnings are sustainable and repeatable; specific characteristics include consistent reporting choices, backing by actual cash flows, and absence of one-time items and long-term estimates; (ii) about 50% of earnings quality is driven by non-discretionary factors such as industry and macro-economic conditions; (iii) in any given period, about 20% of firms manage earnings to misrepresent economic performance, and for such firms 10% of EPS is typically managed; (iv) earnings manipulation is hard to unravel from the outside but peer comparisons and lack of correspondence between earnings and cash flows provide helpful red flags. In addition, CFOs disagree with current standard setting on a number of issues including the sheer number of promulgated rules, the top-down approach to rule-making, the neglect of the matching principle, and the emphasis on fair value accounting. They indicate that a rules-based culture makes the audit function centralized and mechanical, and hinders the development of audit professionals.

The capital-market effects around this change have been extensively studied, but their sources are not yet well understood. This study aims to distinguish between several potential explanations for the observed capital-market effects. We find that, across all countries, mandatory IFRS reporting had little impact on liquidity. The liquidity effects around IFRS introduction are concentrated in the European Union (EU) and limited to five EU countries that concurrently made substantive changes in reporting enforcement. There is little evidence of liquidity benefits in IFRS countries without substantive enforcement changes even when they have strong legal and regulatory systems. Moreover, we find similar liquidity effects for firms that experience enforcement changes but do not concurrently switch to IFRS. Thus, changes in reporting enforcement or (unobserved) factors associated with these changes play a critical role for the observed liquidity benefits after mandatory IFRS adoption.

These results are consistent with managers perceiving that non-disclosure of geographic earnings helps mask tax avoidance behavior. However, the relation between tax avoidance and non-disclosure reduces after implementation of Schedule M-3 in the annual corporate tax filing beginning in 2004. Schedule M-3 requires a detailed reconciliation of book income to tax income and aims to make firms' tax avoidance activities associated with shifting profits to lower-tax foreign jurisdictions more apparent to the IRS.

Fama and Jensen (1983) assert that when equity ownership and corporate decision-making are concentrated in just a small number of decision-makers, these owner-managers will likely be more risk averse and thus less willing to invest in risky projects. Because tax avoidance is a risky activity that can impose significant costs on a firm, we predict that firms with greater concentrations of ownership and control, and thus more risk averse managers, avoid less income tax than firms with less concentrated ownership and control. Our results are consistent with these expectations. However, we also consider a competing explanation for these findings. In particular, we examine whether certain private firms enjoy lower marginal costs of tax planning, which facilitate greater income tax avoidance.

When the source of finance is equity, participants are less likely to make either of these costly decision errors.

Using tax and financial data for individual audit partners and clients, our empirical findings indicate that there is significant variation in the implicit determinants that are associated with compensation across the Big 4. We find that audit partners\u2019 compensation is positively associated with the size of their clientele or the number of publicly traded clients, both of which represent revenue-generating opportunities. Similarly, compensation and developing an industry specialization are positively related. In three firms, gaining clients is clearly related to an increase in compensation, while losing a client is associated with a reduction in partner income in only one firm. We find that audit partner income is more sensitive to performance-related incentives, such as attracting new clients, as partners progress in their career. Finally, we find evidence that audit failures, proxied by reporting errors related to issuing a going concern opinion, are associated with lower compensation. These results should be of interest to the auditing profession, audit firms, and regulators when they consider the effects of implicit incentives of partner compensation on audit quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12009","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial incentives and compensation structures within Big 4 audit partnerships, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In contrast to prior work, we focus on the firm-level heterogeneity in the economic consequences, recognizing that firms have considerable discretion in how they implement the new standards. Some firms may make very few changes and adopt IAS/IFRS more in name, while for others the change in standards could be part of a strategy to increase their commitment to transparency. To test these predictions, we classify firms into \u201clabel\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d adopters using firm-level changes in reporting incentives, actual reporting behavior, and the external reporting environment around the switch to IAS/IFRS. We analyze whether capital-market effects are different across \u201cserious\u201d and \u201clabel\u201d firms. While on average liquidity and cost of capital often do not change around voluntary IAS/IFRS adoptions, we find considerable heterogeneity: \u201cSerious\u201d adoptions are associated with an increase in liquidity and a decline in cost of capital, whereas \u201clabel\u201d adoptions are not. We obtain similar results when classifying firms around mandatory IFRS adoption.

We call this portion earnings recognition timeliness (ERT). The emphasis in our dissection is on empirical identification of two fundamental precepts of financial accounting: (1) the matching principle, which is manifested in the recognition of expenses in the same period as the related benefits (i.e., sales revenue) accrue; and (2) recognition of expenses in the current period due to changes in expectations regarding earnings of future periods (we refer to these expenses as the expectations element of expenses). Although the expectations element has implicitly been at the core of much of the recent empirical literature on asymmetry in the earnings/return relation, it has not been explicitly identified. This recent literature is based on the premise that bad news about the future leads to more recognition of expenses in the current period (such as write-downs) whereas good news about the future tends to have a much lesser effect on expenses of the current period; asymmetry in the expenses/return relation is captured implicitly via the observation of asymmetry in the earnings/return relation (i.e., asymmetry in ERT). Since the ERT reflects the relation between sales revenue and returns, matched expenses and returns, as well as the relation between the expectations element of expenses and returns, a focus on the expectations element may lead to sharper inferences. Our straightforward empirical procedure permits a focus on this element.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12018","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of financial accounting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We also show that the likelihood a parent company will alter the assignment of decision rights to a subsidiary is increasing in the extent of a mismatch although this likelihood is decreasing in the strength of the subsidiary's performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12021","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['decision rights', 'performance', 'multinational']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of decision rights and firm performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, resulting in a low woke score."],["2013","51","5","NEMIT SHROFF,\u00a0\n                     NEMIT SHROFF\n                     Massachusetts Institute of TechnologySearch for more papers by this authorAMY X.

We examine the effect of the Reform on voluntary disclosure behavior before equity offerings and the associated economic consequences. We find that firms provide significantly more preoffering disclosures after the Reform. Further, we find that these preoffering disclosures are associated with a decrease in information asymmetry and a reduction in the cost of raising equity capital. Our findings not only inform the debate on the market effect of the Reform, but also speak to the literature on the relation between voluntary disclosure and information asymmetry by examining the effect of quasi-exogenous changes in voluntary disclosure on information asymmetry, and thus a firm's cost of capital.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12022","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of voluntary disclosure and information asymmetry in the context of securities regulation, with no mention of socially progressive themes, DEI, or ethical considerations.

However, we find no market reaction to the announcement of such changes, even when material enough to result in a favorable recommendation and vote the following year. Our findings suggest that, rather than identifying and promoting superior compensation practices, PAs' key economic role is processing a substantial amount of executive pay information on behalf of institutional investors, hence reducing their cost of making informed voting decisions.

We argue that managers who report about their performance will take into account how their report affects their peers (i.e., other managers at the same hierarchical level). This effect depends on the design of the organization's control system, in particular, on the reward structure and the information policy regarding individual performance reports. The reward structure determines if peers\u2019 monetary payoff is increased or decreased when managers claim a higher level of performance. The information policy determines if managers will be able to link individual peers to their reports and affects the nonmonetary costs of breaking social norms. We present the results of a laboratory experiment. As predicted, we find that participants are more likely to overstate their performance if this increases the monetary payoff of others than if their reported performance decreases others\u2019 monetary gains. In addition, overstatements are lower under an open information policy, where each individual's reported performance is made public, compared to a closed information policy, where participants only learn the average performance of the other participants. Our findings have several important implications for management accounting research and practice.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12025","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['performance', 'reporting', 'honesty']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of performance reporting and control systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Studies typically assume the Basu [1997] asymmetric timeliness coefficient (the incremental slope on negative returns in a piecewise-linear regression of accounting income on stock returns) is a valid conditional conservatism measure. We analyze the measure's validity, in the context of a model with accounting income incorporating different types of information with different lags, and with noise. We demonstrate that the asymmetric timeliness coefficient varies with firm characteristics affecting their information environments, such as the length of the firm's operating and investment cycles, and its degree of diversification. We particularly examine one characteristic, the extent to which \u201cunbooked\u201d information (such as revised expectations about rents and growth options) is independent of other information, and discuss the conditions under which a proxy for this characteristic is the market-to-book ratio.

In particular, we examine the extent to which managers incorporate different performance measures for different types of job assignment. Based on a simple theoretical framework, we predict that, in making promotion decisions, the weight on current job performance decreases with increases in the change in tasks upon promotion, while the weight on subjective assessments of ability increases. This result basically follows from the premise that, with increased changes in tasks between hierarchical levels, the ability to master the current job says little about the ability needed in the next job, which makes current job performance less informative and increases the emphasis on subjective assessments. Using panel data of a retail bank, we find that individual managers behave according to our predictions. By examining the choice of performance measures in promotion decisions, we are able to provide unique insights into the incentive versus sorting roles of promotions, which has important implications for performance measurement and incentive system design.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12027","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['performance measures', 'promotion decisions', 'subjective assessments']","The article focuses on performance measures in promotion decisions, which touches on subjective assessments but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Consistent with the hypothesis that disclosure requirements mitigate information asymmetries in the auctions for failed banks, I find that, when failed banks are subject to more comprehensive disclosure requirements, regulators incur lower costs of closing a bank and retain a lower portion of the failed bank's assets, while bidders that are geographically more distant are more likely to participate in the bidding for the failed bank. The paper provides new insights into the relation between disclosure and the reorganization of a banking system when the regulators' preferred plan of action is to promote the acquisition of undercapitalized banks by healthy ones. The results suggest that disclosure regulation policy influences the cost of resolution of a bank and, as a result, could be an important factor in the definition of the optimal resolution strategy during a banking crisis event.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12028","the impact of disclosure regulation on banks","JAR","Accounting","2","['disclosure', 'information asymmetries', 'regulators']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of bank resolution costs and disclosure requirements without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Indeed, consumers may find it morally distressing when communally focused organizations use overtly commercial marketing strategies like rebranding or value-based pricing. We demonstrate how moral distress and consumer backlash result from such taboo trade-offs and investigate when communal-sharing rhetoric for religious and pharmaceutical marketing reduces distress. Communal justifications used by communally focused organizations are particularly effective when consumers are not closely monitoring the motives of the organization or when the product is need-based. However, communal justifications become less effective and market-pricing justifications become more effective when consumers are attuned to the persuasive intentions of the organization.

We introduce a reverse effect that we term unitosity: changes are magnified by large (vs. small) units because a change of weeks (vs. days) seems larger. We show that numerosity reverses to unitosity when relative salience shifts from numbers to units (study 1). Then, arguing that numbers (units) represent a low-level (high-level) construal of quantities, we show this reversal when mind-set shifts from concrete to abstract (studies 2\u20134).

Three studies demonstrate how presentation order affects package evaluations and choice under different levels of package size and unit price calculation difficulty. The first piece of information becomes salient and affects evaluations when packages are larger and unit price calculations are difficult (i.e., price-item [item-price] makes price [items] salient, negatively [positively] affecting evaluations). These effects do not persist with smaller packages or easier unit price calculations.

A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one\u2019s dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them.

Standard economic models translate these budgetary effects into lateral movements along a set of fixed Engel curves, which relate category expenditure shares to total expenditures. We propose and test a conceptual framework based on the notion of relative consumption, which prescribes that, for any given total consumption budget, expenditure shares for positional goods/services will decrease during a recession, while shares for nonpositional goods/services will increase (i.e., shifting the entire Engel curve upward or downward, depending on the nature of the expenditure category and the economic conditions).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/2/229/1795870","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on household budget allocations during economic changes without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Phenomenological interviews centered on the rereading of books, the rewatching of movies, and the revisiting of geographic places reveal the temporal and focal dimensions of hedonic volitional reconsumption phenomenon and five dominant categories therein. Consumers navigate within and between reconsumption experiences in a hyperresponsive and experientially controlled manner. The dynamics in time and focus fueled by the reconsumed object allow emotional efficiency, as consumers optimize the search for and attainment of the emotional outcomes sought in volitional reconsumption, and facilitate existential understanding, as the linkages across past, present, and future experiences enable an active synthesis of time and promote self-reflexivity. Consumers gain richer and deeper insights into the reconsumption object itself but also an enhanced awareness of their own growth in understanding and appreciation through the lens of the reconsumption object.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/2/341/1797212","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'experiential', 'self-reflexivity']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and hedonic experiences without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Four studies support a metacognitive account for this painful phenomenon. Our central premise is that people use subjective experiences of difficulty while making a decision as a cue to how much further time and effort to spend. People generally associate important decisions with difficulty. Consequently, if a decision feels unexpectedly difficult, due to even incidental reasons, people may draw the reverse inference that it is also important and consequently increase the amount of time and effort they expend. Ironically, this process is particularly likely for decisions that initially seemed unimportant because people expect them to be easier (whereas important decisions are expected to be difficult to begin with). Our studies demonstrate that unexpected difficulty not only causes people to get caught up in unimportant decisions but also to voluntarily seek more options, which can increase decision difficulty even further.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/2/360/1797841","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Six studies show how the production method of versioning may be perceived as unfair and unethical and lead to decreased purchase intentions for the brand.

This additive strategy (\u201cmore is better\u201d) hurts presenters in their perceivers' eyes because mildly favorable information dilutes the impact of highly favorable information.

It is mostly high trust in feelings that improves prediction accuracy rather than low trust in feelings that impairs it. However, the effect occurs only among individuals who possess sufficient background knowledge about the prediction domain, and it dissipates when the prediction criterion becomes inherently unpredictable.

This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An alternative relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and flexibility emerges, which is termed \u201cliquid.\u201d Three characteristics of a liquid relationship to possessions are identified: temporary situational value, use-value, and immateriality.

It is predicted that this motivation systematically affects consumers' product preferences such that consumers in a pleasant mood will tend to choose products that are congruent with their current level of arousal, while those in an unpleasant mood will tend to choose products that are incongruent with their current level of arousal.

Results from five studies suggest that ordering decisions by increasing (vs. decreasing) choice-set size leads to greater search depth (measured by both sampling count and decision time). Initial, smaller choice sets in increasing sequences appear to initiate a maximizing mind-set, which then persists even as participants encounter later, larger choice sets. These participants report a greater desire to maximize and are less satisfied with their decisions, consistent with research on chronic maximizers. In addition, they continue to exhibit maximizing behavior in subsequent, unrelated tasks, supporting a mind-set account of the differences in search.

Forming implementation intentions for a single goal has been shown to facilitate goal achievement, but do such intentions benefit multiple goals? If so, people should form implementation intentions for all their goals, from eating healthily to tidying up. An investigation into this question suggests that the benefits of implemental planning for attaining a single goal do not typically extend to multiple goals. Instead, implemental planning draws attention to the difficulty of executing multiple goals, which undermines commitment to those goals relative to other desirable activities and thereby undermines goal success. Framing the execution of multiple goals as a manageable endeavor, however, reduces the perceived difficulty of multiple goal pursuit and helps consumers accomplish the various tasks they planned for.

Those with more independent self-construals tend to avoid identity-linked products when that identity is threatened versus not threatened. Those with more interdependent self-construals, in contrast, demonstrate more positive preferences for identity-linked products when that aspect of social identity is threatened. These effects arise because, while independents are motivated to restore positive self-worth when a social identity is threatened, interdependents access a repertoire of social identities to fulfill belongingness needs when threatened.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/4/704/1798264","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['social identity', 'ethnic background', 'cultural differences', 'self-construal']","The article explores the impact of social identity threats on consumer behavior, emphasizing ethnic background and cultural differences, which aligns with themes of diversity and inclusion.

Six studies demonstrate that while consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when choices pertain to distant locations and times. This decrease in preference for large assortments is due to psychological distance increasing the similarity of the options in a category, making them appear more substitutable. This effect of psychological distance reverses when consumers consider desirability/feasibility trade-off information inherent in the assortment size decision. These findings point to important outcomes of psychological distance, resolving opposing predictions of construal level theory, and identify boundary conditions for the well-established notion that consumers are attracted to large assortments.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/4/751/1798277","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and psychological distance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Despite a complete lack of conscious recognition, trustworthiness ratings of the composite faces are clearly influenced by the celebrities in question.

The present research applies the structural alignment model to examine how uncertainty associated with the evaluation of services may lead to greater reliance on nonalignable attributes, especially for credence services. The results of three studies provide support for the uncertainty hypothesis. Specifically, study 1 showed that consumers rely more on alignable attributes when evaluating experience services, but shift their focus to nonalignable attributes when evaluating credence services that are associated with greater uncertainty. Using different operationalizations of uncertainty, studies 2 and 3 provided further support for the uncertainty hypothesis by systematically varying the ambiguity of consumer reviews (study 2) and consumer confidence in their judgment (study 3).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/4/831/1798294","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and evaluation of services without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Six dimensions are identified to distinguish among the range of access-based consumptionscapes: temporality, anonymity, market mediation, consumer involvement, the type of accessed object, and political consumerism. Access-based consumption is examined in the context of car sharing via an interpretive study of Zipcar consumers. Four outcomes of these dimensions in the context of car sharing are identified: lack of identification, varying significance of use and sign value, negative reciprocity resulting in a big-brother model of governance, and a deterrence of brand community.

Loss aversion has typically accounted for the endowment effect, but an alternative explanation suggests that ownership creates an association between the item and the self, and this possession-self link increases the value of the good. To test the ownership account, this research examines three moderators that theory suggests should affect the possession-self link and consequently the endowment effect: self-threat, identity associations of a good, and gender. After a social self-threat, the endowment effect is strengthened for in-group goods among both men and women but is eliminated for out-group goods among men (but not women). These results are consistent with a possession-self link explanation and therefore suggest that ownership offers a better explanation for the endowment effect.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/5/1034/1794613","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identity', 'gender', 'self-threat']","The article discusses the role of identity and gender in the endowment effect, indicating a moderate engagement with social themes.

Through an ethnography of surfing culture, this article theorizes consumers' experiences of nature as emerging from assemblages of heterogeneous resources. A theory of assemblage shows that material geographies are vital to the reproduction of romantic discourses. Assemblages of nature are characterized by fragility and contestation, however, due to service structures, technological resources, and social tensions that betray the ideal of external nature. Consumers overcome these contradictions through purifying practices.

Consumers' attitude toward explanation is predicted by their tendency to deliberate, as measured by the cognitive reflection test. Cognitive reflection also predicts susceptibility to the illusion of explanatory depth, the unjustified belief that one understands how things work. When explanation foes attempt to explain, it exposes the illusion, which leads to a decrease in willingness to pay.

This question was studied by examining emerging preferences in choices involving two products that were means to conflicting goals. These preference patterns revealed that an initially active goal, which had been set aside to reconcile a goal conflict, exerted greater than expected influence on the remainder of the choice process. This influence was manifest in a tendency for consumers to revert to the product aligned with the initially active goal upon seeing information that objectively favored neither product. The prevalence of the reversion (i.e., flip-flop) preference pattern suggests that activation of a set-aside goal escalates when it is set aside, much as if its pursuit had been impeded by an external force.

A corollary of this premise is that self-positivity (i.e., underestimating self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the disease base rate is high but the case information suggests low risk. In contrast, self-negativity (i.e., overestimating self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the disease base rate is low, but case information implies high risk. Six experiments provide convergent support for this thesis, using different operationalizations of construal level, base rate, and case risk across multiple health domains. Our findings inform the extant literature on health-risk perception and also provide theoretical implications for research on social comparisons, as well as that on the use of base rate versus case information.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/5/931/1795172","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['health-risk', 'self-positivity', 'self-negativity']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and health-risk perceptions without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Existing research emphasizes moral rationalization, whereby people reconstrue improper behavior in order to maintain support for a transgressor. In contrast, the current research proposes that people also engage in moral decoupling, a previously unstudied moral reasoning process by which judgments of performance are separated from judgments of morality. By separating these judgments, moral decoupling allows consumers to support a transgressor's performance while simultaneously condemning his or her transgressions. Five laboratory studies demonstrate that moral decoupling exists and is psychologically distinct from moral rationalization. Moreover, because moral decoupling does not involve condoning immoral behavior, it is easier to justify than moral rationalization.

One such effect is processing fluency. Building on the change detection literature, this research brings a dynamic perspective to fluency research. Three experiments demonstrate that brand logos and product depictions capture greater fluency when they change location in an advertisement from one exposure to the ad to the next. As a consequence, logo preference and brand choice are enhanced. Evidence shows that spontaneous detection of the location change instigates this process and that change detection is incidental in nature; participants in all three experiments were unable to accurately report which brand logos or product depictions changed location across ad exposures.

This is because choosers presented with their options simultaneously tend to remain focused on the current set of options, comparing them among each other; whereas choosers presented with their options sequentially tend to imagine a better option, hoping it will become available. This feeling of hope undermines how choosers subsequently experience their selected option, resulting in lower satisfaction and commitment levels. Sequential choosers consequently exhibit lower outcome satisfaction regardless of which option they choose, whether sequentially passed-up options remain available, and whether they have equivalent option information to simultaneous choosers. Thus, enjoying the most satisfaction from one's choice might require being willing to give up the eternal quest for the best.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/6/1300/1825407","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making processes in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This is important because smaller denomination bills tend to suffer greater wear than larger denomination bills. Using real money in the context of real purchases, this article demonstrates that the physical appearance of money can override the influence of denomination. The reason being, people want to rid themselves of worn bills because they are disgusted by the contamination from others, whereas people put a premium on crisp currency because they take pride in owning bills that can be spent around others. This suggests that the physical appearance of money matters more than traditionally thought, and like most things in life, it too is inextricably linked to the social context.

Four studies reveal that consumers believe that lifesaving health goods are priced according to perceived need (i.e., communal-sharing principles) and that price consequently influences risk perceptions and intentions to consume care. Specifically, consumers believe that lower medication prices signal greater accessibility to anyone in need, and such accessibility thus makes them feel that their own self-risk is elevated, increasing consumption. The reverse is true for higher prices. Importantly, these effects are limited to self-relevant health threats and reveal that consumers make inconsistent assumptions about risk, prevalence, and need with price exposure.

Divisional managers with social connections to the CEO receive more capital. Connections to the CEO outweigh measures of managers' formal influence, such as seniority and board membership, and affect both managerial appointments and capital allocations. The effect of connections on investment efficiency depends on the tradeoff between agency and information asymmetry.

We show that extreme reliance on short-term financing may be the outcome of a maturity rat race: a borrower may have an incentive to shorten the maturity of an individual creditor's debt contract because this dilutes other creditors. In response, other creditors opt for shorter maturity contracts as well. This dynamic toward short maturities is present whenever interim information is mostly about the probability of default rather than the recovery in default. For borrowers that cannot commit to a maturity structure, equilibrium financing is inefficiently short-term.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12005","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of short-term financing in financial institutions without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

Fund families outsource the management of a large fraction of their funds to advisory firms. These funds underperform those run internally by about 52 basis points per year. After instrumenting for a fund's outsourcing status, the estimated underperformance is three times larger. We hypothesize that contractual externalities due to firm boundaries make it difficult to extract performance from an outsourced relationship. Consistent with this view, outsourced funds face higher powered incentives; they are more likely to be closed after poor performance and excessive risk-taking.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12006","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of mutual fund management and performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that, when demand is moderate, fees are largely insensitive to demand shocks. However, at high demand levels, further increases in demand lead to significantly higher fees and the extent to which demand shocks impact fees is also related to search frictions in the loan market. Moreover, consistent with search models, we find significant dispersion in loan fees, with this dispersion increasing in loan scarcity and search frictions.

Funds managing large risky portfolios with nonconventional strategies seek confidentiality more frequently.

Confidential holdings exhibit superior performance up to 12 months, and tend to take longer to build.

During the 1978 to 2009 period, geography-based trading strategies earn annualized risk-adjusted returns of 5%.

Why are stock returns in excess of government bill rates predictable? This paper proposes an answer to these questions based on a time-varying probability of a consumption disaster. In the model, aggregate consumption follows a normal distribution with low volatility most of the time, but with some probability of a consumption realization far out in the left tail. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the equity premium, while time-variation in the probability of this outcome drives high stock market volatility and excess return predictability.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12018","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock market volatility and risk without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

Approximately 12% of funds have net four-factor model alphas greater than 2% per year. All studies that run fund-by-fund regressions to draw inferences about the prevalence of skill among mutual fund managers are subject to reverse survivorship bias.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12030","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using unique Russian banking transaction data, I identify 42,483 spacemen, fly-by-night firms created specifically for income diversion. Next, I build a direct measure of income diversion for 45,429 companies and show that it is negatively related to firm performance. I identify the main reason for the observed effect as managerial diversion rather than tax evasion per se. I further show that stricter tax enforcement can improve firm performance: a one standard deviation increase in tax enforcement corresponds to an increase in the annual revenue growth rate of 2.6%.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12026","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of income diversion and firm performance without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2013","68","4","NICOLA GENNAIOLI,\u00a0\n                     NICOLA GENNAIOLISearch for more papers by this authorANDREI SHLEIFER,\u00a0\n                     ANDREI SHLEIFERSearch for more papers by this authorROBERT W.

Rather, complexity alters the bidding strategies used by traders, making them less inclined to trade, even when we control for estimation error across treatments.

As a result, bank lines of credit to firms with greater aggregate risk should be costlier and such firms opt for cash in spite of the incurred liquidity premium. We find empirical support for this novel theoretical insight. Firms with higher beta have a higher ratio of cash to credit lines and face greater costs on their lines.

We find that diversified firms have, on average, a lower cost of capital than comparable portfolios of stand-alone firms. In addition, diversified firms with less correlated segment cash flows have a lower cost of capital, consistent with a coinsurance effect.

A divergent pattern exists between investment-grade and speculative-grade rating standards from 1985 to 2002 as investment-grade standards tighten and speculative-grade loosen. In 2002, a structural shift occurs toward more stringent ratings. Holding characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1.5 notches in ratings due to tightened standards from 2002 to 2007.

Using a large, international sample of buyouts from 1980 to 2008, we find that buyout leverage is unrelated to the cross-sectional factors, suggested by traditional capital structure theories, that drive public firm leverage. Instead, variation in economy-wide credit conditions is the main determinant of leverage in buyouts. Higher deal leverage is associated with higher transaction prices and lower buyout fund returns, suggesting that acquirers overpay when access to credit is easier.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12082","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of leveraged buyouts and capital structure theories without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2013","68","6","GRACE XING HU,\u00a0\n                     GRACE XING HUSearch for more papers by this authorJUN PAN,\u00a0\n                     JUN PANSearch for more papers by this authorJIANG WANG,\u00a0\n                     JIANG WANG\n                     Grace Xing Hu is from Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Hong Kong, and Jun Pan and Jiang Wang are from MIT Sloan School of Management, CAFR, and NBER.

A bank makes a loan, learns if it needs monitoring, and then decides whether to lay off credit risk. The bank can transfer credit risk by either selling the loan or buying a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan's control rights; with loan sales, control rights pass to the loan buyer. Credit risk transfer leads to excessive monitoring of riskier credits and insufficient monitoring of safer credits. Increases in banks' cost of equity capital exacerbate these effects. For riskier credits, loan sales typically dominate CDS but not for safer credits. Once repeated lending and consequent reputation concerns are modeled, although CDSs remain dominated by loan sales for riskier credits, for safer credits they can dominate loan sales, supporting better monitoring (albeit to a limited extent) while allowing efficient risk sharing. Restrictions on the bank's ability to sell the loan expand the range in which CDSs are used and monitoring is too low.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12001584","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit risk management and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices."],["2013","107","1","Author links open overlay panelSunil Wahal a 1, M.

This paper argues that there is also a nonlinear wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors causing shareholder loss. The magnitude of the wealth transfer can be quantified in a setting where equity is a call option on firm assets as in the Merton (1974) model. The wealth transfer originates from maturity shortening of the call option as a result of Chapter 11 filing. I present a parsimonious model to explain why Chapter 11 can be voluntarily filed by managers acting in the interest of shareholders with the existence of the wealth transfer. The model-predicted stock return has comparable magnitude as observed stock returns around filing, and explains the cross-sectional variation of the latter.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12001626","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of wealth transfer dynamics in finance without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2013","107","1","Author links open overlay panelGang Li a, Chu Zhang b","Diagnosing affine models of options pricing: Evidence from VIX","ffine jump-diffusion models have been the mainstream in options pricing because of their analytical tractability.

We also estimate empirical pricing kernels using these option prices along with time series models fitted to inflation. The options-implied densities assign considerably more mass to extreme inflation outcomes (either deflation or high inflation) than do their time series counterparts.

We argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs) may draw erroneous inferences and learn incorrectly from their early expansions when new to a dissimilar culture, because their learning abilities are eroded by cultural differences. We posit that the characteristics of an MNE's international expansion, including scope, pace, rhythm, and entry mode, moderate this negative experience effect by influencing the MNE's learning ability in foreign cultures. Using a data set of FDIs by South Korean MNEs between 1990 and 2006, we find a positive relationship between subsidiary mortality and experience when an MNE has a low level of experience in a dissimilar culture. This relationship is weaker if the MNE's prior FDI has been dispersed across different cultures, is stronger if it expanded internationally at a fast pace, and becomes negative once the MNE has accumulated a high level of experience in the host culture. We conclude that, when expanding into dissimilar cultures, MNEs must establish mechanisms to mitigate incorrect learning and reexamine the correctness of inferences drawn from past experience before applying them.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2012.30","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","4","['cultural differences', 'learning', 'foreign direct investment', 'experience']","The article discusses 'cultural differences' and their impact on multinational enterprises, suggesting a recognition of the importance of understanding diverse cultural contexts in business practices.

However, the economic significance of this impact is surprisingly low. Unlike other institutional investors, SWFs are more likely to invest in private equity compared with public equity in target nations where investor protection is low, and where the bilateral political relations between the SWF and the target nation are weak.

Yet criteria for defining regions based on similar factors vary substantially, thus undermining consensus regarding which regional grouping schemes fit IB research models better. In response, we develop and empirically validate a theory of comparative regional scheme assessment for model-building purposes assuming that: (1) schemes can be classified based on their source of similarity; and (2) schemes within the same similarity class can be assessed for their structural coherence, based on group contiguity and compactness. Schemes with better structural coherence will also exhibit better fit with IB research models. We document support for our theory in comparative analyses of regional schemes used to explain where US-based MNCs locate operations around the world. Geography-, culture- and trade and investment-based schemes with better structural coherence exhibit better initial fit with MNC location models and less change in fit after modest scheme refinement using a simulated annealing optimization algorithm.

The roles of place and space are explored using street-level analysis of geographic information systems data for 670 Japanese multinational enterprises (MNE) subsidiaries in 25 conflict-afflicted host countries over 1987\u20132006. Through dynamic modeling of conflict zones as stretchable and shrinkable places relative to subsidiary locations, we develop a means of characterizing a foreign subsidiary's exposure to multiple threats in its geographic domain. Our results show that greater exposure to geographically defined threats, in both a static and a dynamic sense, reduces the likelihood of MNE survival.

Explanations for the mixed findings have important managerial implications, because business managers have to estimate accurately the costs of doing business within and across regions before they make their internationalization decisions. To explain the existing mixed findings, this study differentiates between liabilities of foreignness at the country and regional levels, and explores the joint effects of liability of country foreignness (LCF) and liability of regional foreignness (LRF) on the performance of internationalizing firms. Using data from 167 Canadian firms, we find that LCF may not necessarily be negatively correlated with intra-regional diversification, but LRF is positively correlated with inter-regional diversification. LCF moderates the relationship between LRF and inter-regional diversification, and also mediates the relationship between intra-regional diversification and firm performance. LRF mediates the relationship between inter-regional diversification and firm performance. Missing one or more of these variables may result in different cost estimates.

To test whether risk taking is the channel through which individualism works, we employ two-stage ordinary least squares and other analyses to nullify alternative explanations, such as: (1) uncontrolled institutions determine both individualism and R&D; and (2) firms in individualistic countries invest more in R&D because they have higher investment efficiency, or pick less-risky R&D projects.

We submit that geographic distance has a relatively low impact on international research and development (R&D) investments, owing to the spiky nature of innovation, and to the unique ability of MNEs to absorb and transfer knowledge on a global scale. On the one hand, MNEs need to set up their labs as close as possible to specialized technology clusters where valuable knowledge is concentrated, largely regardless of distance from their home base. On the other, MNEs have historically developed technical and organizational competencies that enable them to transfer knowledge within their internal networks and across technology clusters at relatively low cost. Using data on R&D and manufacturing investments of 6320 firms in 59 countries, we find that geographic distance has a lower negative impact on the probability of setting up R&D than manufacturing plants. Furthermore, once measures of institutional proximity are accounted for, MNEs are equally likely to set up R&D labs in nearby or in more remote locations. This result is driven by MNEs based in Triad countries, whereas for non-Triad MNEs the effect of geographic distance on cross-border R&D is negative and significant.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2013.30","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of multinational enterprises' R&D investments and geographic distance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Empirical results from a multilevel model, based on 375 international licensing agreements of US firms in high-technology industries during 1995\u20132008, show that licensees with a stronger technological potential are more likely to be granted exclusive rights in countries with strong intellectual property rights protection, and in industries with a high rate of technological change; but are less likely to be granted exclusive rights when there is a high degree of overlap between licensor and licensee products.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2013.31","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of licensing agreements and transactional value without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Employing the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method, this paper examines equifinality and functional equivalence of causal factors from the two sources. Empirical analyses with United States Patent and Trademark Office patent data of the semiconductor industry corroborate the main thesis of the paper that multiple paths can lead to the creation of isolating mechanisms and, in these paths, causal factors from the two sources of isolating mechanisms can be functionally equivalent.

Exploring predictors of cluster formation, we draw on the ecocultural perspective and other inputs, and examine the combined role of language, religion, and geography in generating cluster formation.

A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates.

Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors\u2019 estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending ($21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path ($13.83).

An analysis of 1287 marketing-mix activities reported by 439 U.S. managers reveals that firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and firm and environmental characteristics are more useful than managerial characteristics in explaining use of marketing and financial metrics and that use of metrics is positively associated with marketing-mix performance.

These findings suggest that brand managers who want to overcome the less-than-favorable perceptions associated with out-group brands may benefit from drawing on consumers\u2019 moral identity in marketing communications. Theoretically, this research establishes that moral identity extends beyond prosocial behaviors to influence marketplace judgments (i.e., brand attitudes and categorization).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.11.0544","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['moral identity', 'out-group', 'prosocial', 'brand attitudes']","The article discusses the concept of moral identity and its influence on consumer attitudes towards out-group brands, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in marketing.

Whereas previous research has suggested that similar partner resources in a portfolio create redundancy and that dissimilar resources are beneficial, this study argues that redundancy may be necessary to ensure stable access to resources and that synergies from dissimilar resources may be difficult to realize. Thus, under some conditions, resource dissimilarity may be less supportive of, or even detrimental to, the continuity of an alliance. The author identifies several conditional factors that change the role of resource dissimilarity. While relational connectedness between the focal partner and other partners of the firm is found to strengthen the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity on alliance continuity, vertical connectedness of alliance activities, formation of substituting alliances by the focal partner, and market uncertainty weaken the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity. The findings reveal alliance termination factors beyond dyadic interactions and provide important implications for managing interdependencies within an alliance portfolio to enhance alliance stability.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.11.0164","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on resource relationships and alliance dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Supersized products may be attractive to consumers from the standpoint of the unit pricing because ordering a larger size of the same product results in a per-unit savings and offers consumers the opportunity to meet their value-based financial goals. In this article, the authors show that such pricing strategies not only lead to greater purchase and consumption but do so by affecting important consumer goals in unrelated domains\u2014namely, by decreasing the importance placed on health goals. Although supersized pricing can have a powerful effect on purchase behavior, providing health cues can prevent the decreased focus on health. In addition, supersized pricing can be used to increase size choice of healthy foods. The authors discuss the study's contributions to theory, particularly for understanding decisions regarding the pursuit of multiple goals and, more specifically, those that lie at the intersection of health and finance.

The authors present a systematic approach to estimate products\u2019 true value to a firm in such a product network. Their approach, which is in the spirit of the PageRank algorithm, uses available data from large-scale e-commerce sites and separates a product's value into its own intrinsic value, the value it receives from the network, and the value it contributes to the network.

An important question that has not been explored is whether brands benefit from communicating to consumers who had not been involved in the co-creation process that a target ad was developed by a fellow consumer. The authors propose a skepticism\u2013identification model of ad creator influence, which hypothesizes that disclosing to an audience that an ad was created by a consumer triggers two opposing effects: skepticism about the competence of the ad creator and identification with the ad creator. Four studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of disclosing advertising co-creation depends on factors that hinder skepticism and heighten identification with the ad creator. Specifically, attributing the ad to a consumer is shown to increase persuasion when the audience (1) has limited cognitive resources to scrutinize the message, (2) is given background information about the ad creator that enhances source similarity, and (3) has high loyalty toward the brand.

However, the authors propose negative downstream consequences of brand humanization; that is, the anthropomorphization of a brand can negatively affect consumers\u2019 brand evaluations when the brand faces negative publicity caused by product wrongdoings. They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity. Finally, the authors explore three firm response strategies (i.e., denial, apology, and compensation) that can affect the evaluations of anthropomorphized brands for consumers with different implicit theory perspectives. They find that entity theorists have more difficulty in combating the adverse effects of brand anthropomorphization than incremental theorists.

On the one hand, such pricing improves beliefs about the retailer's competitive price advantage on comparatively priced products for which its prices are compared with a competitor.

However, this latter outcome is based on evidence examining the influence of partially comparative pricing across different product categories. The authors propose and demonstrate in five studies that price comparisons may actually improve relative price beliefs about the noncomparatively priced brands within the same product category.

In addition, they examine the moderating role of the identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand\u2013oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer's practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (hard) discounters at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus.

They argue that the net effect of transparent packaging on food consumption is moderated by food characteristics (e.g., unit size, appearance). For small, visually attractive foods, the monitoring effect is low, so the salience effect dominates, and people eat more from a transparent package than from an opaque package. For large foods, the monitoring effect dominates the salience effect, decreasing consumption. For vegetables, which are primarily consumed for their health benefits, consumption monitoring is not activated, so the salience effect dominates, which ironically decreases consumption.

The authors reexamine this relationship over a longer time period than has previously been possible in a representative sample of U.S. consumer markets and find a consistently significant negative market share\u2013customer satisfaction relationship. This is because customer satisfaction is generally not predictive of firms' future market share, but market share is a strong negative predictor of firms' future customer satisfaction. In follow-up analyses, the authors find that a firm's customer satisfaction can predict its future market share when it is benchmarked against that of its nearest rival and customer switching costs are low. In examining why the market share\u2013future customer satisfaction relationship is generally negative, they find strong support for preference heterogeneity as a key mediator in this relationship.

This differs from franchising, in which a contractual arrangement between a franchisor and a franchisee exists to run a business based on the franchisor's business model. Brand licensing helps generate revenues and protect the brand from misappropriation. In such contractual arrangements, agency theory suggests that when parties to the contract engage in moral hazard (i.e., opportunistic behavior), suboptimal outcomes may result. The authors examine how concerns of moral hazard affect royalty rate, a popular form of compensation in brand licensing. From an agency theory perspective, they discuss how market and contract characteristics influence the risk of moral hazard and shape royalty rates in international brand licensing. The results obtained using data from international licensing contracts indicate that a country's intellectual property rights protection enables licensees to benefit from lower royalty rates and market size enables licensors to demand higher royalty rates. The authors also examine impact of other contract characteristics, such as contract duration and exclusivity, on royalty rate.

Four studies conducted in the context of the luxury fashion industry uncover an important conceptual boundary condition of this positive user-design effect. Contrary to extant research, the results show that being \u201cclose\u201d to users does not help but rather harms luxury fashion brands. Specifically, the authors find that user design backfires because consumer demand for a given luxury fashion brand collection is reduced if the collection is labeled as user (vs. company) designed. The results further reveal the underlying rationale for this reversal: user-designed luxury products are perceived to be lower in quality and fail to signal high status, which results in a loss of agentic feelings for the consumer. The authors explore several strategies luxury brands can pursue to overcome this negative user-design effect.

In Study 1, the authors propose a method to derive individual-level habit strength from consumer transaction records and demonstrate the influence of both attitudinal loyalty and habit on repeat purchase. Studies 2a and 2b then show that attitudinal loyalty facilitates cross-selling, whereas habit has the opposite effect. Finally, in Study 3, the authors suggest a specific promotional design that works better for habitual consumers than for those with attitudinal loyalty and demonstrate that ignoring these two underlying drivers can lead to unintended negative consequences on consumer behavior.

The authors find that both initial public offering firms and seasoned equity offering firms adopt a more aggressive marketing strategy during the two years following their offering. However, not all equity issuers benefit equally from increased marketing spending, which can help signal companies' growth prospects to investors. A key moderator of the link between marketing investment and firm value is the strategic flexibility of rivals with respect to issuers. In particular, the stock market reacts favorably to an aggressive marketing strategy initiated by issuers competing against rivals with relatively less flexibility, whereas increased marketing expenditures do not translate into higher firm value when rivals have greater flexibility. Furthermore, the authors show that marketing expenditures create value within context: the role of marketing in enhancing shareholder value and the moderating effect of rivals' strategic flexibility are more pronounced in the two-year window immediately following an equity offering than at any other time.

The AddChange heuristic model of size impression assumes that people add (rather than multiply) the percentage changes in the height, width, and length of objects to compute their volume. This simple deterministic model does not require any data to accurately predict consumers' perceptions of product downsizing and supersizing when one, two, or all three dimensions change proportionately. It also explains why consumers perceive size reductions accurately when only one dimension of the package is reduced but completely fail to notice up to a 24% downsizing when the product is elongated in the manner specified by the model, even when they pay close attention or weigh the product by hand. The model can be used to determine the dimensions of packages that create accurate size perceptions or that increase consumers' acceptance of downsizing.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0228","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['waste', 'overconsumption', 'public health']","The article addresses public concerns about waste and overconsumption, indicating a moderate engagement with social issues related to consumer behavior.

In contrast, OCRs have no significant impact on the sales of the models of strong brands, although these models do receive a significant sales boost from their greater brand equity. Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive OCRs, and increased positive OCRs aid a brand's transition from weak to strong. This creates a positive feedback loop between sales and positive OCRs for models of weak brands that not only helps their sales but also increases overall brand equity, benefiting all models of the brand.

Specifically, the authors show that exposure to consummatory images of unhealthy (vs. healthy) foods increases taste perceptions relative to food images. To explain this effect, the authors argue that seeing an image of someone else indulging in an unhealthy food serves as social proof of the appropriateness and acceptability of indulgent consumption. As such, images of consumers eating act as a justification agent for real consumers, thereby reducing the conflict associated with the subsequent indulgent consumption experience and, in effect, increasing taste perceptions.

Identifying such causal effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect.

Are such bidding patterns meaningful? In this research, the authors propose that because bidders are differentiated in their value to the buyer and competition in these auctions is anonymous, bidders infer their potential quality advantage or disadvantage through their observation of competitive bids and incorporate this information into their responses and price bids. Using point-by-point bid data from two industrial procurement auctions, the authors show that bidders appear to be making inferences about their own implied quality differentials and adjust their bidding strategies and bidding aggression accordingly. Specifically, they find that high-quality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding against potentially lower-quality competition. In contrast, low-quality bidders appear aggressive regardless of their implied quality in relation to the competition.

This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement.

This evolution toward greater accountability is reinforced in harsh economic times when marketing budgets are among the first to be reconsidered. To make such decisions, managers must know whether, and to what extent, marketing's effectiveness varies with the economic tide; however, surprisingly little research addresses this issue. Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and long-term advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger.

Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect of representation level on the difficulty of comparable and noncomparable choices and its downstream implications for decision satisfaction.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0389","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making processes and mental representation without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

A series of six experiments demonstrates that certain consumer behaviors, such as leaning back in a chair while shopping online, can activate the concept of balance and thereby affect the consumer decision-making process. Specifically, consumers experiencing a heightened sense of balance are more likely to choose compromise options. The authors propose and show evidence for the mechanism underlying these effects: that the concept of balance is metaphorically linked in the mind to the concept of parity and that activating balance increases the accessibility of the parity concept. The increased accessibility of parity changes consumer perceptions of the product offerings in a choice set, increasing the selection of compromise options because they provide parity on the described product attributes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0455","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study aims to enhance understanding of brand characteristics as antecedents of WOM by executing a comprehensive empirical analysis. For this purpose, the authors constructed a unique data set on online and offline WOM and characteristics for more than 600 of the most talked-about U.S. brands. To guide this empirical analysis, they present a theoretical framework arguing that consumers spread WOM on brands as a result of social, emotional, and functional drivers. Using these drivers, the authors identify a set of 13 brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, including three (level of differentiation, excitement, and complexity) that have not been studied to date as WOM antecedents. The authors find that whereas the social and functional drivers are the most important for online WOM, the emotional driver is the most important for offline WOM.

In the current research, the authors use in-store video tracking to collect a novel data set that records shopping behavior at the point of purchase, including product consideration. In conjunction with an entrance survey of purchase intentions, they conduct several descriptive analyses that focus on the incidence, category propensity, behavioral characteristics, and outcome of unplanned consideration. The results reveal several new empirical insights. First, the authors find significant category-level complementarities between planned items and unplanned considerations, which they capture using a latent category map. Second, planned consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence, number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g., remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to shelf, references to a shopping list).

Although they find that HDs, like large discounters, especially appeal to private label\u2013prone shoppers and lead to sizable incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains alongside the incumbent are lost.

To address this need, the authors report the results of a large multischool conjoint survey of return-migration preferences among U.S. STEM doctoral students from China. The survey presents the respondents with potential job offers and yields individual-level estimates of each respondent's indirect utility of a job as a function of location, job status, and salary. The authors use a delayed follow-up choice task to demonstrate stability of the preference estimates both over time and across response modalities. The estimated preferences imply that Chinese doctoral graduates tend to remain in the United States because of a large salary disparity between the two countries rather than because of an inherent preference for locating in the United States. Given these estimated preferences, the authors conduct several policy-relevant, counterfactual simulations of return-migration choice and outline effective targeting and positioning strategy for attracting Chinese STEM talent.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0394","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['employment preferences', 'foreign', 'policy-relevant']","The article discusses employment preferences of foreign STEM graduates, indicating some awareness of diversity in the workforce.

Information Specificity in Online Advertising","Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0503","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online advertising effectiveness without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By moving beyond a dyadic view of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational embeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects.

In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration.

Our best branch-and-cut algorithm combined with an efficient heuristic is able to solve the instances significantly faster than CPLEX 12 on the extended formulation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0472","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in network design without any mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

By analyzing models of the behavior of COMPASS and AHA, we show why COMPASS slows down significantly as dimension increases, whereas AHA is less affected.

Risk stems from uncertain disruptions to the system during operation. Whereas a general model would hedge against disruptions in each time period, we study special cases in which only a modest number of disruptions occur. To optimize for risk, we employ a convex approximation based on constraint sampling. We develop a stratified sampling scheme based on distributional information on the time of disruption. We establish that our scheme yields significant savings in sampling costs\u2014up to an order of magnitude in the number of time periods\u2014over naive sampling. Moreover, in the absence of distributional information, we exhibit a sampling strategy that has comparable performance to optimal stratification.

The products purchased on one site are often associated with product purchases on other sites (e.g., a hotel reservation on one site and a car rental on another site). Whereas market basket analysis is often used to discover associations among products for brick-and-mortar stores, it is rarely applied in the online setting where consumers navigate among different online stores to buy products. We define online shopping patterns and develop two novel methods to perform market basket analysis across websites. While this research is motivated by online shopping applications, our contribution is mainly methodological.

The resulting stochastic process is non-Markovian, but it can be analyzed with numerical techniques like a Markov chain, and the results at the level of the automata are stochastic distributions that can be used to compute standard performance and dependability results.

Central to our algorithm is an auxiliary function we propose. We formulate the max-k-cut problem as an explicit mathematical form, which allows us to use an easy implementable local search. The construction of the auxiliary function requires a local maximizer of the max-k-cut problem. If the best local maximizer obtained is used in the construction of the auxiliary function, then the local maximization of the auxiliary function leads to a better maximizer of the max-k-cut problem. This proves to be a good strategy to escape from the current local optima and to search a broader solution space. Indeed, we have shown, both numerically and theoretically, that the maximization of the auxiliary function by the local search method can escape successfully from previously converged discrete local maximizers by taking increasing values of a parameter. Computational results on many test instances with different sizes and densities show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable to find approximate global solutions for the max-k-cut problems. Although we have presented results for k \u2265 2, the robustness of our algorithm is shown for k = 2 by comparisons with a number of recent methods. A number of theoretical results are also presented, which justify the design of our algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1110.0492","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for solving a mathematical problem without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

It has been previously shown that the latter approach may provide better results computationally. In this paper, we provide theoretical investigation of the extent of such improvement generalizing some of the known results from the literature. In particular, we estimate the computational value of mixing randomized restart algorithms with different properties. Under some mild assumptions, we prove that in the best case the mixed algorithm portfolio may perform approximately up to 1.58 times faster than the best single algorithm portfolio. We also show that the obtained upper bound is sharp. Furthermore, the constructive proof of the main result allows us to characterize algorithms that are likely to form an effective mixed algorithm portfolio.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0497","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of algorithm performance without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Its strategy is to explore small subregions of the decision space in succession instead of attempting to explore the entire decision space in a single attempt. This method is especially suitable for complex stochastic systems where little knowledge is available. Although RSM is popular in practice, its current applications in simulation optimization treat simulation experiments the same as real experiments. However, the unique properties of simulation experiments make traditional RSM inappropriate in two important aspects: (1) It is not automated; human involvement is required at each step of the search process; (2) RSM is a heuristic procedure without convergence guarantee; the quality of the final solution cannot be quantified. We propose the stochastic trust-region response-surface method (STRONG) for simulation optimization in attempts to solve these problems. STRONG combines RSM with the classic trust-region method developed for deterministic optimization to eliminate the need for human intervention and to achieve the desired convergence properties. The numerical study shows that STRONG can outperform the existing methodologies, especially for problems that have grossly noisy response surfaces, and its computational advantage becomes more obvious when the dimension of the problem increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0498","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for simulation optimization without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The sum of costs needed for building the Steiner tree, facility opening costs, and the assignment costs needs to be minimized. If the number of edges between a prespecified node (the so-called root) and each open facility is limited, we speak of the hop constrained facility location problem (HC ConFL). This problem is of importance in the design of data-management and telecommunication networks. In this article we provide the first theoretical and computational study for this new problem that has not been studied in the literature so far. We propose two disaggregation techniques that enable the modeling of HC ConFL: (i) as a directed (asymmetric) ConFL on layered graphs, or (ii) as the Steiner arborescence problem (SA) on layered graphs. This allows for usage of best-known mixed integer programming models for ConFL or SA to solve the corresponding hop constrained problem to optimality. In our polyhedral study, we compare the obtained models with respect to the quality of their linear programming lower bounds. These models are finally computationally compared in an extensive computational study on a set of publicly available benchmark instances. Optimal values are reported for instances with up to 1,300 nodes and 115,000 edges.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0500","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to facility location and network design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Upon arrival, a customer order is quoted a lead time of d, and placed in the queue according to the priority class of the customer. Orders within the same priority class are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. We derive the Laplace transforms of the expected tardiness of the order given the quoted lead time, priority class of the order, and system status. For the special case of single priority class, the Laplace transform can be inverted into a closed-form expression. For the case with multiple priority classes, a closed-form expression cannot be obtained, hence, we develop three customized numerical inverse Laplace transformation algorithms. Two of these algorithms provide upper and lower bounds for the expected tardiness under a simple condition on system parameters. Using this property, we obtain error bounds for our customized algorithms; such bounds are not available for general purpose numerical inversion algorithms in the literature. Next, we develop a novel methodology to compare the precision of general purpose numerical inversion algorithms and analyze the performances of three algorithms from the literature. Finally, we provide a recommendation scheme given computational time and error tolerances of the decision maker. The methods developed in this paper for the accurate estimation of expected tardiness establish an important step toward developing due date quotation policies in a multiclass queue, contributing to the due date quotation literature that has been largely focused on single-class queues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0507","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical computations related to queuing systems without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity themes.

Finding the scalarization parameters that optimally limit the approximation error when generating a single Pareto optimal solution is a nonconvex optimization problem. This problem can be solved by enumerative techniques but at a cost that increases exponentially with the number of objectives. We present an algorithm for solving the Pareto surface approximation problem that is practical with 10 or less conflicting objectives, motivated by an application to radiation therapy optimization. Our enumerative scheme is, in a sense, dual to a family of previous algorithms. The proposed technique retains the quality of the best previous algorithm in this class while solving fewer subproblems. A further improvement is provided by a procedure for discarding subproblems based on reusing information from previous solves. The combined effect of the enhancements is empirically demonstrated to reduce the computational expense of solving the Pareto surface approximation problem by orders of magnitude. For problems where the objectives have positive curvature, an improved bound on the approximation error is demonstrated using transformations of the initial objectives with strictly increasing and concave functions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0508","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for optimization problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we utilize the theories of social networks and economic incentives to investigate the formation of P2P networks with rational participating agents (active peers). The paper proposes a framework for multilevel formation dynamics, including an individual level (content-sharing decision and group selection) and a group level (membership admission, splitting, and interconnection). It is found that if the network size (the number of peer nodes) is sufficiently large, the stable (self-selected equilibrium) free-riding ratio could be nonzero, contrary to the common belief that everybody should free ride. The efficient (welfare-maximizing) free-riding ratio is not necessarily zero; that is, a certain degree of free riding is beneficial and should be tolerated. The sharing level in a network increases (decreases) with the download (upload) capacities of its peer nodes. In addition, the heterogeneity of content availability and upload capacity discourages sharing activities. Although the sharing level of a stable group is typically lower than that of an efficient group, the self-formed network may have a larger or smaller group size than what is efficient, depending on the structure of the group admission decision process. It is also observed that self-organized interconnections among groups lead to network inefficiency because the network may be over- or underlinked. To recover the efficiency loss during the formation process, we propose internal transfer mechanisms to force stable networks to become efficient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0517","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of peer-to-peer networks and their efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These processes may arise in various domains such as business, healthcare, etc. In knowledge-intensive environments, it is important that APMS technology ensures error-free process execution and compliance with semantic constraints. However, most process design tools handle only syntactic constraints. This restricts their value in real-world applications considerably. This paper proposes a novel approach to check the compliance of process models against semantic constraints and the validity of process change operations using mixed-integer programming (MIP). The MIP formulation allows us to describe existential, dependency, ordering, and various other relationships among tasks along with business policies in a standard way. In addition to incorporating the semantic constraint specifications into an MIP formulation, we introduce three novel ideas in this paper: (1) the notion of degree of compliance of processes to constraints based on a penalty function, (2) the concepts of full and partial validity of change operations, and (3) the idea of compliance by compensation. Thus, compensation operations derived from compliance degree can transform a noncompliant process into a compliant one both at design and execution time. We illustrate our approach in the context of a healthcare workflow as a way to reduce medical errors and argue that it is more elegant and superior to a pure logic-based approach. Complex scenarios with multiple concurrent processes (and constraints across them) for a single patient are also considered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0520","","JOC","Information Systems","2","['compliance', 'process', 'healthcare']","The article focuses on technical aspects of process compliance and error reduction in healthcare without addressing social justice or equity themes.

The integer programming formulation for the BWP with the queueing delay restriction contains a nonlinear constraint that is intrinsic to the model.

This multilevel vertical ordering (MLVO) problem is a quadratic ordering problem and conceptually related to the well-studied problem of multilevel crossing minimization (MLCM). In contrast to the latter, it can be formulated such that it does not merely consist of multiple sequentially linked bilevel quadratic ordering problems, but as a genuine multilevel problem with dense cost matrix. This allows us to describe the graphs' structures more compactly and therefore obtain solutions for graphs too large for MLCM in practice. In this paper we give motivation and mathematical models for MLVO. We formulate linear and quadratic programs, including some strengthening constraint classes, and an SDP relaxation for MLVO. We compare all approaches both theoretically and experimentally and show that MLVO's properties render linear and quadratic programming approaches inapplicable, even for small sparse graphs, while the SDP works surprisingly well in practice. This is in stark contrast to other ordering problems like MLCM, where such graphs are typically solved more efficiently with integer linear programs. Finally, we also compare our approach to related MLCM approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0525","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to graph ordering and optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Thus, resource providers absorb all risk arising from end users' demand volatilities. We focus on the revenue risk management of commodities with highly volatile demand profiles using cloud computing as the application domain and bandwidth as the exemplar commodity. We extend the state of the art in risk hedging by introducing a new concept of dynamic forward contracts where a provider and a client flexibly interact through offers and responses over a set of time periods in a horizon. We develop an optimal pricing mechanism that takes into account the risk propensities of the provider and the client. The overall mechanism is modeled as a pair of nested dynamic programs denoting the offer-response interactions. The mechanism also incorporates two learning components: short-term learning on the client's demand and long-term learning on the client's risk propensity. We characterize two approaches for predicting the client's demand\u2014a recursive demand prediction model and an aggregate demand prediction model. Detailed experimental studies of the proposed mechanism using real Web traffic data on the clients of Amazon Web Services have been carried out. The empirical results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed mechanism over benchmark mechanisms such as the current industry practice of spot markets and static forward pricing mechanisms proposed in the literature in ex ante and ex post settings. The results also highlight key interaction effects among parameters controllable by a provider and the risk propensities of the market players, leading to valuable managerial implications for the practical adoption of the proposed mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0526","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management in cloud computing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This local search zigzags along the Pareto surface guided by the gradients and iteratively returns the visited Pareto optima. Many continuous MOO problems have smooth objective functions and the set of the nondominated objective function values forms a regular surface in the image space. This fact motivates developing the zigzag search method for such relatively well-posed MOO problems. A simple implementation of this method, z-algorithm, is presented particularly for continuous bi-objective optimization (BOO) problems with well-connected Pareto optimal solutions.

Our model takes into account the parameter estimation risk by defining the asset returns and the return covariance terms as random variables. The variance of the index fund return is required to be below a low-risk threshold with a large probability, thereby limiting the market risk exposure of the investors. The resulting stochastic integer problem is reformulated through the derivation of a deterministic equivalent for the risk constraint and the use of a block decomposition technique. We develop an exact outer approximation method based on the relaxation of some binary restrictions and the reformulation of the cardinality constraint. The method provides a hierarchical organization of the computations with expanding sets of integer-restricted variables and outperforms the Bonmin and the CPLEX solvers. The method can solve large instances (up to 1,000 securities), converges fast, scales well, and is general enough to be applicable to problems with buy-in-threshold constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0533","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to constructing financial models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting no evidence of woke themes."],["2013","25","4","Robert AboolianRobert Aboolianraboolia@csusm.eduCollege of Business Administration, California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, California 92096Search for more papers by this author, Tingting CuiTingting Cuitingting@ieor.berkeley.eduDepartment of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720Search for more papers by this author, Zuo-Jun Max ShenZuo-Jun Max Shenshen@ieor.berkeley.eduDepartment of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720Search for more papers by this author","An Efficient Approach for Solving Reliable Facility Location Models","We consider reliable facility location models in which facilities are subject to unexpected failures, and customers may be reassigned to facilities other than their regular facilities.

However, although uniformization has many advantages, the computational cost required to calculate transient probabilities is very large for stiff models. We study efficient solutions that can be applied to an approximate method developed for calculating transient state probabilities of Markov models and cumulative expected reward measures over a finite interval. Our work is based on a method that approximates the state probabilities at time t by the state probabilities calculated at a random time with Erlangian distribution. The original method requires an inversion of a matrix obtained from the state transition rate matrix that destroys special structures such as sparseness and banded matrices. This precludes the use of the technique for large models. In our work we propose efficient solutions that can take advantage of special structures. Finally, we present examples that show that the proposed technique is computationally very efficient for stiff models when compared with uniformization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0537","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Markovian models and computational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2013","25","4","Walid W.

The basic idea of the new method is the use of a randomization construct with different randomization rates for up and down states. The new method is numerically stable and computes the measure with well-controlled truncation error. In addition, for large CTMC models, when the maximum output rates from up and down states are significantly different, and when the interval availability has to be guaranteed to have a level close to one, the new method is significantly or moderately less costly in terms of CPU time than a previous randomization-based state-of-the-art method, depending on whether the maximum output rate from down states is larger than the maximum output rate from up states, or vice versa. Otherwise, the new method can be more costly, but a relatively inexpensive for large models switch of reasonable quality can be easily developed to choose the fastest method. Along the way, we show the correctness of a generalized randomization construct, in which arbitrarily different randomization rates can be associated with different states, for both finite CTMCs with infinitesimal generator and uniformizable CTMCs with denumerable state space.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0539","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for computing interval availability distributions without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Positive-versus-negative (pVn) classification is a new method for the implementation of base models for aggregation. pVn classification involves the decomposition of a k-class prediction task into m (m < k) subproblems. One base model is constructed for each subproblem to predict a subset of the k classes. The base models are then combined into one aggregate model for prediction. This paper reports studies that were conducted to demonstrate the performance of pVn classification when large volumes of data are available for modeling as is commonly the case in data mining. It is demonstrated in this paper that pVn modeling provides the capability to use a large amount of available data (in a large data set) for base model training. It is also demonstrated that pVn models created from large data sets provide a higher level of predictive performance compared to single k-class models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0540","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for model aggregation in predictive data mining without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper we present a new overall framework for approximating the split closure that merges different ideas from the previous approaches.

Nevertheless, use of the systems varies. The price points that these systems generate through the analysis of demand forecasts are, by their very nature, imperfect prescriptions. Given the risk of forecast error in certain reservation contexts, hotel agents are often given the latitude to accept rate bids below the pricing prescriptions of these systems. The frequency and extent of such deviation is dependent in large part on the judgment of reservation agents, who in turn are influenced by their perceptions of how their actions will be viewed by higher levels of management. In this study, we use a laboratory experiment to investigate how different forms of continuous performance feedback influence agent decisions. More specifically, we consider both a revenue-focused metric as well as a metric framed around pricing-curve adherence as the basis of two feedback mechanisms of interest. In an attempt to provide additional insight, we also monitored physiological markers of stress and arousal to determine the emotional state of subjects. The purpose is to use such observations in support of theory regarding the impact of performance measure orientation on decision making. The results suggest implications for the practical use of continuous feedback in these settings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.06.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of revenue management systems in the hospitality industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet, despite conventional wisdom that firms should improve their own operations by observing problems that occur in others\u2019 processes, significant operational risks appear to be ignored and similar losses recur. Using a randomized vignette-based field experiment, we tested the influence of organization-level factors on knowledge acquisition. Two organization-level factors, namely perceived operational similarity, and to a lesser extent, market leadership, significantly influenced the risk manager's likelihood of acquiring knowledge about possible causes that triggered another firm's operational loss. These findings suggest that senior managers need to develop organizational systems and training to expand the screening by risk managers to enhance knowledge acquisition.

Males tend to prefer taking greater risk than women, and this leads them to order more in the newsvendor problem (in high margin settings).

We believe acquiring labor flexibility is not sufficient; its implementation is an important intervening step when companies have to tackle accompanying technical and behavioral side effects of labor flexibility. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model in which we introduce an intervening variable to capture the implementation of labor flexibility. In addition, evolving human resource management practices that promote acquisition of labor flexibility are also examined in our model. Case studies in ten printed circuit board plants validated our model. Subsequently, survey data collected from 74 PCB plants was analyzed using Partial Least Squares method. Supporting the proposed model, the results show that the impact of acquired labor flexibility on plant performance is not direct but experienced through the sophistication of labor flexibility implementation exercised by the plant. Our findings also suggested that plants that emphasized process-focused training, provided greater job-rotation training, and designed positive reward structures, acquired higher labor flexibility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2012.11.003","invited research paper","JOM","Operations Management","3","['labor flexibility', 'human resource management', 'training']","The article discusses labor flexibility and human resource management practices, which touch on workforce dynamics but do not strongly emphasize social justice or equity themes.

The paradox states that although professionals with more expertise tend to decide in different ways, they often do not make better assessments than those with less expertise. We first replicate that this paradox exists in a context of the assessment of operational supply risks, and then show how the paradox can be understood as the consequence of process characteristics mediating the relation between expertise and assessment performance.\n            \n            Using an experimental setup, we had 234 OSCM-professionals assess the operational risk in two series of different business cases, and measured several characteristics of their decision-making process. The strength of our approach lies in the fact that the business cases were real-life cases from our database of purchasing transactions in the area of IT-purchasing. This allows a comparison of the risk assessments of the professionals with the actual supply risk as was known from the survey database. Our findings show that, contrary to what is often assumed, the OSCM-professionals with more expertise do not use less information while assessing, nor are they faster. Instead, our results show that specialized expertise goes with increased certainty about the assessments, and general expertise goes with an increased use of intuitive judgment. However, the net effects of these expertise characteristics on assessment performance are zero. In the case of specialized expertise this is because specialized expertise is itself negatively related to performance.

An important aspect of these behavioral drivers is that they may operate (at least in part) through emotions. Emotions influence behavior in ways that are relevant to performance in processes; for example, anger prompts employees to refuse cooperation, fear inhibits workers\u2019 willingness to take initiatives (for example, in continuous improvement), and shame motivates them to change behavior.\n            \n            This study provides experimental evidence that the social preferences systematically trigger emotions. This happens not \u201clinearly\u201d (more achievement of a social preference might be expected to cause more positive emotions), but rather in more complex patterns that regulate social relationships. Arbitrary (but earned) status signals trigger pride, while status achievement from being lucky does not. An externally (not by an own fault) caused status loss triggers anger and disgust. Not receiving cooperation by another person triggers anger, but more so if the cooperation failure violates a reciprocity expectation; the happiness form receiving cooperation by another person is attenuated by guilt and sadness is the subject itself has previously refused cooperation to the other person. Events happening to salient in-group members trigger emotions as if they happened to subjects directly, including if the in-group member behaves in an embarrassing way.\n            \n            These results are relevant for front-line managers because they help predicting and interpreting emotional reactions of employees: awarding or withholding status, offering or demanding reciprocity, and the creation of in-groups have emotional effects that depend on the context in predictable ways.

However, the empirical results as to the relationship between supplier integration and time-to-market are ambivalent. To understand this important relationship, we incorporate two major recent developments. First, the literature has started to redefine supplier integration into two dimensions, supplier product integration and supplier process integration. Second, recent research has begun to examine spillover effects that extend beyond the direct costs and benefits of the supplier contract. Using survey data of 116 firms in the industrials, health care, and information technology industries, the results confirm our hypotheses and show that supplier product integration decelerates time-to-market while supplier process integration accelerates time-to-market. The results also show a positive relationship between supplier integration and the adoption of external technologies, which either decelerates or accelerates time-to-market depending on the level of internal exploration activities. Our research, thus, helps to open the \u2018black-box\u2019 of the relationship between supplier integration and time-to-market, and provides a theoretically grounded explanation to the apparent contradictory results in prior research about the influence of supplier integration on time-to-market.

In this study, we use dyadic data on 102 outsourcing relationships to investigate how dimensions of task- and location-specific complexity influence the degree of control and coordination costs incurred by the customer organization. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that the scale of the service and the geographic distance between the customer and provider locations are associated with higher levels of both control and coordination costs. Task breadth and geographic dispersion are significantly associated with increased control costs, but not coordination costs. Counter to our expectations, control costs decrease with the degree of service customization, whereas both control and coordination costs are negatively related to the average cultural distance between provider and customer organizations.

Contrary to the economic benefits expected, recent findings pinpoint implementation hurdles that lead to a potential performance decline, the so-called \u2018servitization paradox\u2019. In this paper, we analyze this paradox by disentangling the value creation and value appropriation processes of 44 national subsidiaries of a global manufacturing firm turned product-service provider, in the 2001\u20132007 period. Our findings show that the firm under study is able to successfully transcend the inherent substitution of products by services and to enact complementary sales dynamics between the two activities. Moreover, labor-intensive services such as maintenance, which imply higher levels of customer proximity, further enhance product sales. Empirical results also reveal a positive yet non-linear relationship between the scale of service activities and profitability: while initial levels of servicing result in a steep increase in profitability, a period of relative decline is observed before the positive relationship between the scale of services and profitability re-emerges. These findings suggest the presence of initial short-term gains but also indicate the existence of a \u2018profitability\u2019 hurdle; profitable growth seems feasible only to the extent that investments in service capability are translated into economies of scale.

However, scant research has been devoted to examining information technology (IT) investment among hospitals and how it influences patient care and financial performance. Using the lens of the Theory of Swift Even Flow (TSEF), we present an operations management-based perspective on the effect of IT in streamlining hospital operations. Specifically, we examined the role of IT on patient flow and its consequences for improved hospital efficiency and performance.\n            \n            Analysis of data from 567 U.S. hospitals shows that IT is associated with swift and even patient flow, which in turn is associated with improved revenues. Interestingly, we find that the improvement in financial performance is not at the expense of quality because we find similar effects of IT and patient flow in improvements in the quality of patient care. Further, we observed differential effects of swift flow and even flow on various measures of hospital performance. Although swift flow affects financial performance, even flow primarily affects quality performance. Taken together, they have a mutually reinforcing overall impact on hospital performance.\n            \n            The implications of these findings for hospital decision makers are that patient flow is an important mediating variable that is affected by IT and can significantly affect the quality of patient care and financial performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['patient care', 'quality', 'performance']","The article discusses the impact of information technology on patient care and hospital performance, which touches on quality and efficiency in healthcare.

The results show that environmental complexity positively moderates the effects of lean operations and lean purchasing on performance. However, environmental dynamism reduces the benefits of lean operations on performance, but enhances the benefits of lean purchasing on performance. Robustness tests further confirm the contingent effects of complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing.

We explore the role of various contextual factors at the firm-level (i.e., technology intensity, labor productivity, and labor intensity) and industry-level (i.e., industry efficiency level, industry competitiveness, industry sales growth, and industry ISO 9000 adoption level) that potentially impact the efficacy of ISO 9000 adoption. We carry out a hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis based on objective financial data from 438 U.S. manufacturing firms. The results show that firms with low technology intensity, low labor productivity and high labor intensity reap more benefit from ISO 9000 adoption. Firms in industries with low efficiency levels, high competition, high sales growth and low ISO 9000 adoption levels also obtain more benefit from the adoption. Our research provides supporting evidence for the context-dependent proposition of ISO 9000 adoption.

However, the role of justice in improving performance in supply chain relationships is an under-investigated subject in the literature. In studying the joint impact of justice dimensions, the traditional assumption is that the three forms of justice interact with each other in a multiplicative manner. However, this assumption creates a managerial problem as discussed in this paper. We outline a different view of how the justice dimensions interact with one another utilizing the constraining factor model (CFM). We show that the CFM resolves some of the problems arising from the choice of multiplicative interaction of justice measures on performance. Specifically, we demonstrate that an increase in procedural, distributive or interactional justice results in a significant and positive improvement in performance only if the specific justice dimension is the constraining factor in the relationship. Overall, our analysis suggests that all three dimensions are important and a high level of one of the justice elements will not compensate for a low level of another, a view that is put forward by a number of past research studies in justice. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.05.001","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['justice', 'performance', 'distributive', 'procedural']","The article discusses the concept of justice within supply chain relationships, emphasizing the importance of procedural and distributive justice, which aligns with themes of equity and fairness.

We propose two measures of inventory dynamics: one metric to assess the fluctuations of quarterly inventories within the year and a second metric to quantify relative year-over-year inventory growth. Our results indicate that within-year inventory volatility (IV) and abnormal year-over-year inventory growth (ABI) are associated with abnormal stock returns. Both metrics cannot be entirely explained by common risk factors. We find that firms with high IV and low ABI have the best long-term stock returns, and that stock performance decreases monotonically with higher ABI values. Our results are robust to various control variables including size, book-to-market value, industry and prior performance. We therefore conclude that changes in inventory levels provide valuable insights into the risks and opportunities faced by a company.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.05.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory dynamics and stock returns without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity themes, resulting in a score of 1."],["2013","31","5","Jos\u00e9 Holgu\u00edn-Veras,\u00a0\n                     Jos\u00e9 Holgu\u00edn-Veras\n                     \n                        jhv@rpi.edu\n                     \n                     William H.

We found that the two key components of CPFR, collaborative forecasting (CF) and collaborative replenishment (CR), exhibit distinct learning curves. Forecast accuracy improves immediately following CPFR implementation but the rate of improvement slows over time, whereas inventory levels increase at first and begin decreasing after a period. Further, we found different learning effects in terms of inventory levels when products are later replaced with new form factors. Product replacements have lower inventory levels than their antecedents, at least for low-end products.

As such, firms expend considerable effort in managing their inventories efficiently. Among other factors, information technology (IT) capability can play an important role in enabling inventory efficiency and financial performance. However, insight into the chain-of-effects linking IT capability, inventory efficiency, and stock market returns and risk remains limited. In this paper, we provide a conceptual model outlining the relationships between these constructs. Next, we evaluate the model using secondary information on firms from multiple industries across the 10-year time period of 2000\u20132009. Our analysis confirms that firms\u2019 IT capability plays a significant role in enhancing their inventory efficiency, which, in turn, is observed to increase stock market returns. Our results also reveal that firms\u2019 IT capability directly reduces their stock market risk and enhances their stock market returns. Taken together, these findings, along with the conceptual model that we advance, have important research and managerial implications.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information technology and its impact on inventory efficiency and shareholder wealth, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2013","31","6","Terence J.V.

The objective of this study is to examine the extent to which value generated by information systems for collaborating versus transacting is contingent upon demand volatility. We analyze a unique dataset assembled from non-public U.S. Census Bureau data of manufacturing plants. Our findings suggest that when faced with volatile demand, plants employing information systems for collaborating with suppliers and customers experience positive and significant benefits to performance, in terms of both labor productivity and inventory turnover. In contrast, results suggest that plants employing information systems for transacting in volatile environments do not experience such benefits. Further exploratory analysis suggests that in the context of demand volatility, these two distinct dimensions of IT-based integration have differing performance implications at different stages of the production process in terms of raw-materials inventory and finished-goods inventory, but not in terms of work-in-process inventory. Taken together, our study contributes to theoretical and managerial understanding of the contingent value of information systems in volatile demand conditions in the supply chain context.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['collaborating', 'transacting', 'performance', 'demand volatility']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of information systems in operations management, with a limited mention of collaboration.

As a result, they have improved their ability to coordinate and synchronize shared business processes by using more complete, accurate, and timely information. These electronic linkages are based on open-standard interorganizational information systems (OSIOS), which are fundamentally different from traditional electronic data interchanges. OSIOS capture not only the technical specifications for data interchange but also the sequential steps for the execution of shared business processes. Because OSIOS are still at an early diffusion stage, it remains unclear why firms would assimilate such an innovation and whether assimilation provides firms any benefits. In this research, we develop a framework grounded on the economics of standards, institutional theory, and strategic interorganizational information systems literatures to investigate the drivers and outcomes of OSIOS assimilation in a focused context. In order to test our hypotheses based on this framework, we used data from a high-technology supply chain and employed econometrics techniques. We found that both competition asymmetry across supply chain echelons and OSIOS assimilation within supply chain echelons predict individual firms\u2019 OSIOS assimilation. The results also suggest that firms\u2019 supply chain dominance is both a driver and an outcome of OSIOS assimilation, highlighting a mutually reinforcing process. In addition, our study reveals boundary conditions of the hypothesized relationships. The use of multiple theoretical perspectives, a unique dataset, and innovative statistical techniques to investigate OSIOS assimilation in high-technology supply chains contributes to the body of knowledge in both the supply chain management and management of information systems disciplines.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.008","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['interorganizational', 'information systems', 'supply chains']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of information systems and supply chain management without any significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

With intense competition for market share and profits, information systems and technology (IST) sourcing decisions are becoming increasingly important to e-Retail firms to support continued growth and market responsiveness. Drawing on the contingency theory, we examine organizational and environmental factors that influence an e-Retailer's IST sourcing strategy of make versus buy in enabling its value chain activities, and we also look at firm-level performance impacts of IST sourcing decisions that involve bundling across value chain activities. We test the proposed model and hypotheses using a panel data set of 307 firms over the period of 2006\u20132010. The results show that firms that make transformative IT investments tend to source a smaller portion of IST for their e-Retail value chain activities than firms that pursue automate or informate as their strategic role for IT investment. Capabilities are positively associated with IST sourcing. Firms experienced in e-Retail are more likely to build rather than buy their IST. In addition, we find mimicking behavior for IST sourcing among firms in the same merchandizer category. We find that IT strategic role is strongly associated with growth metric, whereas sourcing decisions predominantly impact operational performance measures. There is partial evidence that alignment between IT strategic role and IST sourcing decisions results in better performance effects. Moreover, complementary IST sourcing of synergistic marketing and sales activities positively impacts Web sales and conversion rate, but the sourcing combination of logistics, operations, and sales activities is associated with lower Web sales and conversion rate.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.009","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['value chain', 'sourcing', 'performance', 'IT investments']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of IT sourcing strategies and performance metrics in the e-Retail sector, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Enterprise systems provide firms with platforms for electronically integrating their supplier and demand chain activities. Spill-over benefits refer to the impacts that occur when IT investments in one organizational domain benefit performance in a different value chain side of the firm. Supply-side electronic integration (SEI) refers to the use of electronic means to integrate the exchange of information and transactions with suppliers through enterprise systems. In our research, we examine whether SEI generates spill-over effects on customer service performance, over and beyond firms\u2019 direct investments in customer-side digitization. We also examine whether structural attributes of the firm (e.g., vertical integration, diversification, and centralization) moderate the effects of supply-side electronic integration on customer service performance. Our analysis of a secondary dataset of InformationWeek 500 firms shows that SEI helps firms realize cost-savings in their customer service performance, especially if they are less vertically integrated. In addition, SEI investments help diversified and centralized firms achieve cross-selling with their customers. We also find that SEI is more likely to help decentralized and diversified firms achieve customization in their customer service activities. These results suggest that SEI helps firms achieve twin goals in customer service: cost reduction and revenue expansion. Overall, our research reveals how supply-side electronic integration could generate benefits in customer service performance in firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.010","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply-side electronic integration and its impact on customer service performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Thus, although performance is impacted directly only by the lower-level capability, the higher-level capability facilitates the development and use of the lower-level capability. Our research model is tested using survey data from a large sample of 412 manufacturing firms. The results provide strong support for the proposed research model. In particular, we find that as hypothesized, the impact of procurement integration competence on performance is completely mediated by digital procurement competence.

Organizations invest large sums in various types of information technologies (ITs) to manage operational knowledge. Because of their superior storage, processing and communication capabilities, ITs offer technical platforms to build knowledge management (KM) capabilities. However, merely acquiring ITs are not sufficient, and organizations must structure information system (IS) designs to leverage ITs for building KM capabilities. We study how technical and strategic IS designs enhance operational absorptive capacity (OAC) \u2013 the KM capability of an operations management (OM) department. Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective of absorptive capacity to examine potential absorptive capacity (POAC) and realized absorptive capacity (ROAC) capabilities \u2013 the two OAC capabilities that create and utilize knowledge, respectively. Our theory proposes that integrated IS capability, \u2013 an aspect of technical IS design \u2013 is an antecedent of POAC and ROAC capabilities, and business-IT alignment \u2013 an aspect of strategic IS design \u2013 moderates the relationship between integrated IS capability and ROAC capability. Combining data gleaned from a multi-respondent survey with archival data from COMPUSTAT, we test our hypotheses using a dataset from 153 manufacturing organizations. By proposing that IS design enables an OM department's KM processes, i.e., the POAC and ROAC capabilities, our interdisciplinary theoretical framework opens the \u201cblack box\u201d of OAC and contributes to improved understanding of IS and OM synergies.

The model is supported in three studies conducted in the context of three different SCM system implementations (N = 278, 282, and 304, respectively). In particular, I found that individuals perceived a significant change in their work process characteristics following an SCM system implementation, and changes in work process characteristics had a significant impact on job and process outcomes. These findings contribute to the information systems and operations management literatures and their intersections by offering insights on challenges related to IT-enabled SCM innovation implementation in organizations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.014","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['employee outcomes', 'job satisfaction', 'job security']","The article discusses employee-level outcomes in the context of supply chain management, which touches on aspects of job satisfaction and job security.

We introduce and demonstrate the application of acceptability to evaluate complex economic mechanisms. In particular, we apply our approach to the evaluation of continuous combinatorial auctions, which represent a complex, sophisticated market mechanism that has not been generally available in the online marketplace but has the potential to enhance the economic efficiency of trade for assets with interdependent values. Such auctions are being increasingly used in industry, e.g., to procure logistical services. Intuitively, acceptance and usage of a complex mechanism can be fostered by a design that provides information and tools that meet the users\u2019 task demands. Based on prior research and an analysis of the auction tasks, we discuss practical and innovative information feedback schemes for reducing the cognitive burden of formulating bids in combinatorial auctions. Then, we use constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM) \u2013 which have been consistently shown to be key determinants of technology acceptance in the extant literature \u2013 to compare the acceptability of the mechanism under three different information regimes. In addition, we borrow constructs from marketing theory to assess the potential growth in adoption of the mechanism. We compare user perceptions of the three alternative designs in a laboratory experiment with over 130 subjects. Our study constitutes a complementary and novel approach in evaluating the design of complex economic mechanisms. Results indicate a higher adoption and usage potential of the mechanism with advanced information feedback, supporting the potential of combinatorial auctions as a user-acceptable market mechanism with appropriate feedback.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.015","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['economic mechanisms', 'acceptability', 'information feedback']","The article primarily focuses on the technical evaluation of economic mechanisms and user acceptance, with minimal reference to social themes.

Extending this perspective across different tiers in the healthcare supply chain, we investigate how organizations in different tiers in the supply chain (i.e. hospitals, distributors and manufacturers) respond to institutional pressures when implementing IOS. How institutional dynamics unfold across multiple tiers of a supply chain is an uncharted area of research, and we take the theory-building case study approach using data collected from ten organizations. Because organizations are embedded in their respective tiers, our within-tier analyses are equivalent to cross-organization analyses. In this regard, the cross-case analyses occur at two different levels: at each tier level (i.e. across multiple hospitals, multiple distributors and multiple manufacturers) and across the supply chain (i.e. across all three tiers). The study shows how different institutional pressures such as coercive, mimetic, and normative manifest across the tiers. It also demonstrates how a differential mix of endogenous and institutional pressures lead to mixed organizational responses across the tiers. The propositions developed from the study enrich institutional theory arguments within the information systems and supply chain management disciplines. They highlight how the IOS implementation dynamics within and across different tiers in a supply chain result in heterogeneous rather than isomorphic consequences, thereby exposing the \u201ciron cage\u201d of institutionalization.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.016","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['institutional pressures', 'heterogeneity', 'supply chain', 'normative']","The article discusses institutional pressures and their impact on organizational responses within the healthcare supply chain, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations and diversity in organizational practices.

We explore when and how three conditions of psychological contract breach \u2013 attribute, severity, and timing \u2013 negatively impact outcomes, and assess the mediating role of psychological contract violation in this relationship.

This paper hopes to inspire more theorizing engagements through the formal process of metaphorical transfer. Metaphorical transfer transforms casually-invoked metaphors in everyday language into theory-constitutive metaphors. This transformation process first mandates theorizing to ensure equivalence between the domain of the metaphor and that of a target phenomenon or research problem of interest. Second, theorizing during metaphorical transfer occurs when abstracted insights intended to govern both the metaphor and target phenomenon materialize. Finally, metaphorical transfer supports borrowing of theories from outside of OM/SCM for testing within OM/SCM by safeguarding against common mistakes. This paper demonstrates metaphorical transfer via the example of divorce and strategic buyer\u2013supplier relationship dissolution and concludes by highlighting other metaphors that may be invoked for a number of exemplary supply chain relationship phenomena.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.06.004","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on metaphorical transfer in operations management and supply chain management without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

To disentangle the effects at the levels of states, counties, and hospitals, we use the mixed-effects modeling approach. The results obtained from econometric analyses indicate that clinical quality and clinical flexibility reduce cardiology unit average length of stay. Clinical flexibility also helps in reducing the average cost of cardiology units.

To increase responsiveness, supply chain managers often seek information that provides greater visibility into factors affecting both demand and supply. Managers often claim, however, that they are awash in data yet lacking in valuable information. Taken together, these conditions suggest that supply chain visibility is a necessary, but insufficient capability for enabling supply chain responsiveness. Based on organizational information processing theory, we posit that a supply chain organization's internal integration competence provides complementary information processing capabilities required to yield expected responsiveness from greater supply chain visibility. An analysis of data from 206 firms strongly supports this hypothesis. For supply chain managers, these findings indicate that a strategy for achieving supply chain responsiveness requires a dual-pronged approach that aligns increased visibility with extensive information processing capabilities from internal integration. For researchers, this study provides an initial examination of visibility as a construct, and extends a growing literature addressing integration as an information processing capability.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2013.09.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['visibility', 'responsiveness', 'integration']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and technical aspects of supply chain management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Established theoretical foundations applied to this domain have related to protection motivation, deterrence, planned behavior, self-efficacy, individual adoption factors, organizational commitment, and other individual cognitive factors.  But another class of violation demands greater research emphasis:  the intentional commission of computer security policy violation, or insider computer abuse.  Whether motivated by greed, disgruntlement, or other psychological processes, this act has the greatest potential for loss and damage to the employer.  We argue the focus must include not only the act and its immediate antecedents of intention (to commit computer abuse) and deterrence (of the crime), but also phenomena which temporally precede these areas.

For example, combinatorial auctions\u2014in which bidders can bid on combinations of goods\u2014have been shown to increase the economic efficiency of a trade when goods have complementarities.  However, the lack of real-time decision support tools for bidders has prevented this mechanism from reaching its full potential.  With the objective of facilitating bidder participation in combinatorial auctions, this study, using recent research in real-time bidder support metrics, discusses several novel feedback schemes that can aid bidders in formulating combinatorial bids in real-time.  The feedback schemes allow us to conduct continuous combinatorial auctions, where bidders can submit bids at any time.  Using laboratory experiments with two different setups, we compare the economic performance of the continuous mechanism under three progressively advanced levels of feedback.  Our findings indicate that information feedback plays a major role in influencing the economic outcomes of combinatorial auctions.  We compare several important bid characteristics to explain the observed differences in aggregate measures.  This study advances the ongoing research on combinatorial auctions by developing continuous auctions that differentiate themselves from earlier combinatorial auction mechanisms by facilitating free-flowing participation of bidders and providing exact prices of bundles on demand in real time.  For practitioners, the study provides insights on how the nature of feedback can influence the economic outcomes of a complex trading mechanism.\n10-05-12","https://misq.umn.edu/impact-of-information-feedback-in-continuous-combinatorial-auctions-an-experimental-study-of-economic-performance.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of economic performance in combinatorial auctions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

While there is an emerging literature on IPC, there is limited agreement about its conceptualization in terms of its key dimensions and its factor structure.  Based on the multidimensional developmental theory and a review of the prior literature, we identify alternative conceptualizations of IPC.  We examine the various conceptualizations of IPC with four online surveys involving nearly 4,000 Internet users.  As a baseline, study 1 compares the integrated conceptualization of IPC to two existing conceptualizations in the literature.  While the results provide support for the integrated conceptualization, the second-order factor model does not outperform the correlated first-order factor model.  Study 2 replicates the study on a different sample and confirms the results of study 1.  We also investigate whether the prior results are affected by the different perspectives adopted in the wording of items in the original instruments.  In study 3, we find that focusing on one\u2019s concern for website behavior (rather than one\u2019s expectation of website behavior) and adopting a consistent perspective in the wording of the items help to improve the validity of the factor structure.  We then examine the hypothesized third-order conceptualizations of IPC through a number of alternative higher-order models.  The empirical results confirm that, in general, the third-order conceptualizations of IPC outperform their lower-order alternatives.  In addition, the conceptualization of IPC that has the best fit with the data contains a third-order general IPC factor, two second-order factors of interaction management and information management, and six first-order factors (i.e., collection, secondary usage, errors, improper access, control, and awareness). Study 4 cross-validates the results with another data set and examines IPC within the context of a nomological network.  The results confirm that the third-order conceptualization of IPC has nomological validity, and it is a significant determinant of both trusting beliefs and risk beliefs.

Operationalizing e-government service quality to investigate and improve the design of e-government websites has been a much sought-after objective.  Yet, there is a lack of actionable guidance on how to develop e-government websites that exhibit high levels of service quality.  Drawing from marketing literature, we undertake a goal approach to this problem by delineating e-government service quality into aspects of IT-mediated service content and service delivery.  Whereas service content describes the functions available on an e-government website that assist citizens in completing their transactional goals, service delivery defines the manner by which these functions are made accessible via the web interface as a delivery channel.  We construct and empirically test a research model that depicts a comprehensive collection of web-enabled service content functions and delivery dimensions desirable by citizens.  Empirical findings from an online survey of 647 respondents attest to the value of distinguishing between service content functions and delivery dimensions in designing e-government websites.  Both service content and delivery are found to be significant contributors to achieving e-government service quality.  These IT-mediated service content functions and delivery dimensions represent core areas of e-government website design where the application of technology makes a difference, especially when considered in tandem with the type of transactional activity.

In the information and communication technology (ICT) context, a growing number of studies consider the affective dimension of human interaction with ICTs.  However, few of these studies take systematic approaches, resulting in inconsistent conclusions and contradictory advice for researchers and practitioners.  Many of these issues stem from ambiguous conceptualizations of various affective concepts and their relationships.  Before researchers can address questions such as \u201cwhat causes affective responses in an ICT context\u201d and \u201cwhat impacts do affective responses have on human interaction with ICTs,\u201d a theoretical foundation for affective concepts and their relationships has to be established.\n\n\t\tThis theory and review paper addresses three research questions:  (1) What are pertinent affective concepts in the ICT context?  (2) In what ways are these affective concepts similar to, or different from each other?  (3) How do these affective concepts relate to or influence one another?  Based on theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, the affective response model (ARM) is developed.  ARM is a theoretically bound conceptual framework that provides a systematic and holistic reference map for any ICT study that considers affect.  It includes a taxonomy that classifies affective concepts along five dimensions:  the residing, the temporal, the particular/general stimulus, the object/behavior stimulus, and the process/outcome dimensions.  ARM also provides a nomological network to indicate the causal or co-occurring relationships among the various types of affective concepts in an ICT interaction episode.  ARM has the power for explaining and predicting, as well as prescribing, potential future research directions.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-affective-response-model-a-theoretical-framework-of-affective-concepts-and-their-relationships-in-the-ict-context.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['affect', 'human interaction', 'social contexts']","The article discusses the role of affect in human decisions and behaviors, which touches on social contexts but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Within organizations, IS habits may develop over long periods of time and are typically embedded within larger, frequently practiced, higher-level work routines or task sequences.  When new systems are introduced for the purpose of at least partially replacing incumbent systems, existing IS habits embedded in these routines may inhibit adoption and use of the new systems.  Therefore, understanding how work-related IS habits form, how they enable and inhibit behavior, and how they can be disrupted or encouraged requires that we examine them within the context of organizational and individual level work routines. The current study integrates psychology and organizational behavior literature on cognitive scripts and work routines to examine IS habits as they occur embedded within larger, more complex task sequences.  The objective of the paper is to contribute to the IS habit literature by (1) situating IS habits within the context of their associated work routines and task sequences, and (2) providing a theoretical understanding of how incumbent system habits can be disrupted, and how development of new system habits can be encouraged, within this context.  We draw from extant research in psychology, organizational behavior, and consumer behavior to offer propositions about context-focused organizational interventions to break, or otherwise discourage, the continued performance of incumbent system habits and to encourage the development of new system habits.  Specifically, our theoretical development includes script disruption techniques, training-in-context, and performance goal suspension as organizational interventions that disrupt incumbent system habits.

Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content.  This approach does not capitalize on users\u2019 social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry\u2019s need to elicit payment from consumers.  We suggest that both of these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website\u2019s digital business strategy.  \n\n\t\tWe use data from Last.fm, a site offering both music consumption and online community features.  The basic use of Last.fm is free, and premium services are provided for a fixed monthly subscription fee.  Although the premium services on Last.fm are aimed primarily at improving the content consumption experience, we find that willingness to pay for premium services is strongly associated with the level of community participation of the user.  \n\n\t\tDrawing from the literature on levels of participation in online communities, we show that consumers\u2019 willingness to pay increases as they climb the so-called \u201cladder of participation\u201d on the website.

This fusion of IT within the business environment gives rise to a strategic tension between investing in digital artifacts for long-term value creation and exploiting them for short-term value appropriation.  Further, relentless innovation and competitive pressures dictate that firms continually adapt these artifacts to changing market and technological conditions, but sustained profitability requires scalable architectures that can serve a large customer base and stable interfaces that support integration across a diverse ecosystem of complementary offerings.  The study of digital business strategy needs new concepts and methods to examine how these forces are managed in pursuit of competitive advantage.

By divergent influence, we mean an influence that leads to spending substantially more or less on a particular strategic activity than industry norms.  We predict that a digital strategic posture (difference from the industry mean) has an increasingly divergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry turbulence, while having an increasingly convergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry concentration and higher industry growth.

Much of the extant research on the IT/strategy relationship, however, inaccurately frames IT as only a functional-level strategy.  This widespread under-appreciation of the business-level role of IT indicates a need for substantial retheorizing of its role in strategy and its complex and interdependent relationship with the mechanisms through which firms generate profit.  Using a comprehensive framework of potential profit mechanisms, we argue that while IT activities remain integral to the functional-level strategies of the firm, they also play several significant roles in business strategy, with substantial performance implications.  IT affects industry structure and the set of business-level strategic alternatives and value-creation opportunities that a firm may pursue.  Along with complementary organizational changes, IT both enhances the firm\u2019s current (ordinary) capabilities and enables new (dynamic) capabilities, including the flexibility to focus on rapidly changing opportunities or to abandon losing initiatives while salvaging substantial asset value.  Such digitally attributable capabilities also determine how much of this value, once created, can be captured by the firm\u2014and how much will be dissipated through competition or through the power of value chain partners, the governance of which itself depends on IT.  We explore these business-level strategic roles of IT and discuss several provocative implications and future research directions in the converging information systems and strategy domains.","https://misq.umn.edu/information-technology-and-business-level-strategy-toward-an-integrated-theoretical-perspective1.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['value', 'profit', 'strategy']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between information technology and business strategy with an emphasis on profit generation, lacking significant references to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Conventional approaches to catering for culture are restricted to adaptations for specific countries and modify only a limited number of interface components, such as the language or date and time formats.  We argue that a more comprehensive personalization of interfaces to cultural background is needed to appeal to users in expanding markets.  This paper introduces a low-cost, yet efficient method to achieve this goal:  cultural adaptivity.  Culturally adaptive interfaces are able to adapt their look and feel to suit visual preferences.  In a design science approach, we have developed a number of artifacts that support cultural adaptivity, including a prototype web application.  We evaluate the efficacy of the prototype\u2019s automatically generated interfaces by comparing them with the preferred interfaces of 105 Rwandan, Swiss, Thai, and multicultural users.

Digital technologies play a key role in such organizations. Prior research studying digital business strategies has largely focused on building production-side competencies and there has been little focus on customer-side digital business strategies to leverage these technologies.  We propose a theory to understand the effectiveness of a customer-side digital business strategy focused on localized dynamics\u2014here, a firm\u2019s customer service units (CSUs).  Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective to propose digital design as an antecedent to two customer service capabilities\u2014namely, customer orientation capability and customer response capability\u2014across a firm\u2019s CSUs.  These two capabilities will help a firm to locally sense and respond to customer needs, respectively.  Information quality from the digital design of the CSU is proposed as the antecedent to the two capabilities.  Proposed capability-building dynamics are tested using data collected from multiple respondents across 170 branches of a large bank.  Findings suggest that the impacts of information quality in capability-building are contingent on the local process characteristics.

While some research has examined how such delays can be reduced and how much delay online users will tolerate, little research has taken a theoretically grounded approach to managing perceptions of the wait.  Based on time perception theories, we develop a research model of the effects of actual wait time, amount of information, and direction of attention on perceptions of the wait.  Two empirical studies were conducted using an experimental travel website to test the proposed hypotheses.  The results show that with shorter waits, providing additional visual content, such as a travel picture, may make the wait feel longer.  However, with longer waits, additional visual content that distracts the user from the passage of time makes the wait feel shorter and reduces users\u2019 negative affect toward the wait.  Further, the benefits of providing visual content in longer waits are enhanced as more content is provided.  Visual content should also be chosen to distract the user from time and temporal processing, as reminding users of the passage of time can encourage temporal processing and make the wait feel longer, especially in longer waits or when the amount of temporal visual content is high.  Our findings extend time perception theories and contribute to the literature by identifying a potential paradigm shift, from the retrospective to the prospective paradigm, when waiting times are prolonged.  Post hoc study results confirm the practical contribution of our research, demonstrating that several key findings are counter-intuitive to professional web designers.","https://misq.umn.edu/when-filling-the-wait-makes-it-feel-longer-a-paradigm-shift-perspective-for-managing-online-delay.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managing online delays in e-commerce without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Research on management information systems is reviewed to outline a protective specification of this model where managers participate in the production of performance data to suppress information that threatens the image they present to leaders.  Ethnographic data about the production and use of performance records and performance reports in a desk sales unit is examined to induce an exploitive specification of this dramaturgical model.  This specification explains how people can take advantage of the opportunities, rather than just avoid the threats that performance data presents for impression management.  It also demonstrates how managers can participate in the production of performance data to create an idealized version of their accomplishments and that leaders reify these data by using them in their own attempts at impressing others.

This has led many organizations to adopt hybrid federated information technology governance (ITG) structures to find this balance.  This approach to ITG establishes demand for various means to coordinate effectively across the organization to achieve the desired benefits.  Past research has focused on the efficacy of various coordination mechanisms (e.g., steering committees, task forces) to coordinate activities related to information technology.  However, we lack insights as to how and why these various coordination approaches help organizations achieve desired coordinated outcomes.  This research specifically identifies coordinating as a process.  Adopting the philosophy of critical realism, we conducted a longitudinal, comparative case study of two coordinating efforts in a federated ITG structure.  Through a multifaceted approach to scientific logic employing deductive, inductive, and retroductive elements, we explicate two causal mechanisms, consensus making and unit aligning, which help to explain the coordinating process and the coordination outcomes observed in these efforts.  We additionally elaborate the operation of the mechanisms through the typology of macro\u2013micro\u2013macro influences. Further, we demonstrate the value of the causal mechanisms to understanding the coordinating process by highlighting the complementarity in insights relative to the theories of power and politics and of rational choice.

Strong","Critical Realism and Affordances:  Theorizing IT-Associated Organizational Change Processes","Convincing arguments for using critical realism as an underpinning for theories of IT-associated organizational change have appeared in the Information Systems literature.  A central task in developing such theories is to uncover the generative mechanisms by which IT is implicated in organizational change processes, but to do so, we must explain how critical realism\u2019s concept of generative mechanisms applies in an IS context.  Similarly, convincing arguments have been made for using Gibson\u2019s (1986) affordance theory from ecological psychology for developing theories of IT-associated organizational change, but this effort has been hampered due to insufficient attention to the ontological status of affordances.  In this paper, we argue that affordances are the generative mechanisms we need to specify and explain how affordances are a specific type of generative mechanism.  We use the core principles of critical realism to argue how affordances arise in the real domain from the relation between the complex assemblages of organizations and of IT artifacts, how affordances are actualized over time by organizational actors, and how these actualizations lead to the various effects we observe in the empirical domain.  After presenting these arguments, we reanalyze two published cases in the literature, those of ACRO and Autoworks, to illustrate how affordance-based theories informed by critical realism enhance our ability to explain IT-associated organizational change.  These examples show how researchers using this approach should proceed, and how managers can use these ideas to diagnose and address IT implementation problems.","https://misq.umn.edu/critical-realism-and-affordances-theorizing-it-associated-organizational-change-processes.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['critical realism', 'organizational change', 'affordances']","The article discusses critical realism and its application to organizational change, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or equity themes.

Given the complexity of these social and behavioral phenomena, heterogeneity is likely to exist in the samples used in IS studies.  While researchers now routinely address observed heterogeneity by introducing moderators, a priori groupings, and contextual factors in their research models, they have not examined how unobserved heterogeneity may affect their findings.  We describe why unobserved heterogeneity threatens different types of validity and use simulations to demonstrate that unobserved heterogeneity biases parameter estimates, thereby leading to Type I and Type II errors.  We also review different methods that can be used to uncover unobserved heterogeneity in structural equation models.  While methods to uncover unobserved heterogeneity in covariance-based structural equation models (CB-SEM) are relatively advanced, the methods for partial least squares (PLS) path models are limited and have relied on an extension of mixture regression\u2014finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) and distance measure-based methods\u2014that have mismatches with some characteristics of PLS path modeling.  We propose a new method\u2014prediction-oriented segmentation (PLS-POS)\u2014to overcome the limitations of FIMIX-PLS and other distance measure-based methods and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the ability of PLS-POS and FIMIX-PLS to discover unobserved heterogeneity in both structural and measurement models.  Our results show that both PLS-POS and FIMIX-PLS perform well in discovering unobserved heterogeneity in structural paths when the measures are reflective and that PLS-POS also performs well in discovering unobserved heterogeneity in formative measures.  We propose an unobserved heterogeneity discovery (UHD) process that researchers can apply to (1) avert validity threats by uncovering unobserved heterogeneity and (2) elaborate on theory by turning unobserved heterogeneity into observed heterogeneity, thereby expanding theory through the integration of new moderator or contextual variables.\n\n3/15/13","https://misq.umn.edu/discovering-unobserved-heterogeneity-in-structural-equation-models-to-avert-validity-threats.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['heterogeneity', 'validity', 'social systems']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of structural equation modeling and validity threats without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In addition to demonstrating the practical value of MA, the paper contributes to the Information Systems literature on ICT for development (ICT4D).

However, little attention has been paid to the generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure, that is, the causal powers that explain how and why such infrastructure evolves over time.  This is unfortunate, since more knowledge about what drives digital infrastructures would be highly valuable for managers and IT professionals confronted by the complexity of managing them.  To this end, this paper adopts a critical realist view for developing a configurational perspective of infrastructure evolution.  Our theorizing draws on a multimethod research design comprising an in-depth case study and a case survey.  The in-depth case study, conducted at a Scandinavian airline, distinguishes three key mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution:  adoption, innovation, and scaling.  The case survey research of 41 cases of digital infrastructure then identifies and analyzes causal paths through which configurations of these mechanisms lead to successful evolution outcomes.  The study reported in this paper contributes to the infrastructure literature in two ways.  First, we identify three generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure and how they contingently lead to evolution outcomes.  Second, we use these mechanisms as a basis for developing a configurational perspective that advances current knowledge about why some digital infrastructures evolve successfully while others do not.  In addition, the paper demonstrates and discusses the efficacy of critical realism as a philosophical tradition for developing substantive contributions in the field of information systems.\n12/03/12","https://misq.umn.edu/the-generative-mechanisms-of-digital-infrastructure-evolution.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['critical realism', 'infrastructure', 'evolution']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of digital infrastructure evolution and does not emphasize social justice or equity themes.

Leonardi","When Does Technology Use Enable Network Change in Organizations?  A Comparative Study of Feature Use and Shared Affordances","The goal of this study is to augment explanations of how newly implemented technologies enable network change within organizations with an understanding of when such change is likely to happen.  Drawing on the emerging literature on technology affordances, the paper suggests that informal network change within interdependent organizational groups is unlikely to occur until users converge on a shared appropriation of the new technology\u2019s features such that the affordances the technology enables are jointly realized.  In making the argument for the importance of shared affordances, this paper suggests that group-level network change has its most profound implications at the organization level when individuals use the same subset of a new information technology\u2019s features.  To explore this tentative theory, we turn to a comparative, multimethod, longitudinal study of computer-based simulation technology use in automotive engineering.  The findings of this explanatory case study show that engineers used the new technology for more than three months, during which time neither group experienced changes to their advice networks.  Initially, divergent uses of the technology\u2019s features by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate their work in ways that allowed them to structure their advice networks differently.  Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups converged on the use of a common set of the technology\u2019s features to enact a shared affordance.  This convergence was necessary to turn the technology into a resource that could collectively afford group members the ability to compare their simulation outputs with one another and, in so doing, alter the content and structure of the group\u2019s advice network.  The implications of these findings for the literatures on technology feature use, affordances, social networks, and post-adoption behaviors in organizations are discussed.","https://misq.umn.edu/when-does-technology-use-enable-network-change-in-organizations-a-comparative-study-of-feature-use-and-shared-affordances.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['network change', 'shared affordances', 'technology use']","The article discusses technology use and network change within organizations but does not emphasize social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

This helps explain why the adoption of a number of new technologies\u2015from Amazon\u2019s Kindle, to Apple\u2019s iPod, iPhone, and iPad, to various types of Web 2. 0 technologies\u2015appears to have adoption patterns similar to those of new fashion trends (i. e., an initial en masse acquisition followed by subsequent abandonment).  It is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology.  From a herd behavior perspective, this study proposes two new concepts, namely discounting one\u2019s own information and imitating others, to describe herd behavior in technology adoption. A research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs, how it impacts technology adoption decision making, and how it influences post-adoptive system use.  A longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model.  Findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one\u2019s own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology.  Herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption; however, it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base, as predicted in the herd literature.  Instead, imitation can help reduce post-adoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology, which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance.  People tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the post-adoptive stage.

IT-enabled personalization, while potentially making the user computing experience more gratifying, often relies heavily on the user\u2019s personal information to deliver individualized services, which raises the user\u2019s privacy concerns.  We term the tension between personalization and privacy, which follows from marketers exploiting consumers\u2019 data to offer personalized product information, the personalization\u2013privacy paradox.  To better understand this paradox, we build on the theoretical lenses of uses and gratification theory and information boundary theory to conceptualize the extent to which privacy impacts the process and content gratifications derived from personalization, and how an IT solution can be designed to alleviate privacy concerns.\n\n\t\tSet in the context of personalized advertising applications for smartphones, we propose and prototype an IT solution, referred to as a personalized, privacy-safe application, that retains users\u2019 information locally on their smartphones while still providing them with personalized product messages.  We validated this solution through a field experiment by benchmarking it against two more conventional applications:  a base non-personalized application that broadcasts non-personalized product information to users, and a personalized, non-privacy safe application that transmits user information to a central marketer\u2019s server.  The results show that (compared to the non-personalized application), while personalized, privacy-safe or not  increased application usage (reflecting process gratification), it was only when it was privacy-safe that users saved product messages (reflecting content gratification) more frequently.  Follow-up surveys corroborated these nuanced findings and further revealed the users\u2019 psychological states, which  explained our field experiment results.  We found that saving advertisements for content gratification led to a perceived intrusion of information boundary that made users reluctant to do so.  Overall our proposed IT solution, which delivers a personalized service but avoids transmitting users\u2019 personal information to third parties, reduces users\u2019 perceptions that their information boundaries are being intruded upon, thus mitigating the personalization\u2013privacy paradox and increasing both process and content gratification.","https://misq.umn.edu/addressing-the-personalization-privacy-paradox-an-empirical-assessment-from-a-field-experiment-on-smartphone-users.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'personalization', 'user information', 'psychological states']","The article discusses the tension between personalization and privacy, highlighting user concerns about data exploitation, which aligns with ethical considerations in technology.

The synergistic properties of the two studies demonstrate the existence of two IS use patterns, automatic and adjusting.  Most interactions are automatic, and adjusting patterns, triggered by discrepant IT events, fade over time and transition into automatic ones.  Further, automatic patterns result in enhanced short-term performance, while adjusting ones do not.

These changes are theorized to be predicted by work process characteristics, namely perceived process complexity, perceived process rigidity, and perceived process radicalness, that in turn will be influenced by technology characteristics (i.e., perceived technology complexity, perceived technology reconfigurability, and perceived technology customization).  JCCM further posits that changes in job characteristics will influence employees\u2019 job satisfaction.

We conjecture that, first, blogs are influential at the screening stage; second, after the screening stage, blogs are noninfluential since decision makers evaluate entities closely at later stages; third, blogs increase the interest from multiple decision makers which in turn increases the cost of the deal for a decision maker. This empirical investigation provides support for the hypotheses, which we tested for funding decisions by venture capitalists in information technology ventures.  In particular, this study indicates that blogs can help managers in getting their products/services selected at the screening stage, but, beyond that, blogs do not help directly.  However, since more decision makers screen products/services that receive blog coverage, the competition among decision makers helps managers in negotiating better contract terms.

Over the years, numerous approaches have been used to rank IS journals, approaches such as citation metrics, school lists, acceptance rates, and expert assessments.

In the current scientometric study, we make significant strides toward correcting for these limitations in the ranking of mainstream IS journals.  We compare expert rankings to bibliometric measures such as the ISI Impact Factor\u2122, the h-index, and social network analysis metrics.  Among other findings, we conclude that bibliometric measures provide very similar results to expert-based methods in determining a tiered structure of IS journals, thereby suggesting that bibliometrics can be a complete, less expensive, and more efficient substitute for expert assessment.

For this purpose, we use the web portal as a test of the theoretical propositions underlying its design.

Our results confirm the positive impact of goal setting on energy conservation.  We show that default goals lead to statistically significant savings by affecting goal choice.  However, if the default goals are set too low or too high with respect to a self-set goal, the defaults will detrimentally affect behavior.

The literature on information technology (IT) and identity has highlighted the identity-challenging and identity-enhancing aspects of new IT use for existing actor categories but has not examined the dynamics associated with the emergence of new actor categories.  Here, we investigate how a new actor category may emerge through the use of new media as a dynamic interaction of discursive practices, identity claims, and new media use.  Drawing on findings from a case study of technology bloggers, we identified discursive practices through which a group of technology bloggers enacted claims of a distinctive identity in the joint construction of their discourse and in response to continuous developments in new media.

But the extent of price discrimination must often be tempered by the high costs of devising and managing discriminatory tariffs, including costs of supporting consumers in understanding and making selection from a complex menu of choices. These tariff design trade-offs occur in many industries where firms face many consumer types and each consumer picks the number of units to consume over time. Examples include wireless communication services, other telecom and information technology products, legal plans, fitness clubs, automobile clubs, parking, healthcare plans, and many services and utilities. This paper evaluates alternative ways to price discriminate while accounting for both revenues and tariff management costs. The revenue-maximizing menu of quantity-price bundles can be very (or infinitely) large and hence not practical. Instead, two-part tariffs (2PTs), which charge a fixed entry fee and a per-unit fee, can extract a large fraction of the optimal revenue with a small menu of choices, and they become more attractive once the costs of tariff management are factored in. We show that three-part tariffs (3PTs), which use an additional instrument, the \u201cfree allowance,\u201d are an even more efficient way to price discriminate. A relatively small menu of 3PTs can be more profitable than a menu of 2PTs of any size. This 3PT menu can be designed with less information about consumer preferences relative to the menu of two-part tariffs, which, in order to segment customers optimally, needs fine-grained information about preferences. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that more-complex tariffs need not always be more profitable; it matters whether the complexity is from many choices or more pricing instruments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0720","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and revenue maximization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Another one is the information asymmetry among consumers. In this paper, we consider fashion as a means consumers use to signal belonging to a higher social rank and propose an analytical model of fashion hits in the presence of competition and consumers who can coordinate on which product to use. We show that, consistent with the observed market phenomenon, in equilibrium, consumer coordination involves randomization between products chosen, i.e., in randomness of fashion hits. Analyzing optimal consumer choice, we find that whenever low-type consumer demand for a product is positive, a price increase results in a higher probability of high-type consumers choosing this product but lower low-type consumer demand. We also show that although high-type consumers may prefer (higher) prices that would lead to complete separation of the high- and the low-type consumers through product use, in equilibrium, firms always price as to attract positive demand from low-type consumers. The equilibrium price and profits turn out to be nonmonotonic in the low-type consumer valuation of being recognized as belonging to a higher social rank. Equilibrium profits first increase and then decrease in this valuation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0742","","MKS","Marketing","2","['fashion', 'consumer', 'social rank']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and market dynamics in fashion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Among other things, we investigate whether previously established findings hold when consumer and competitive dynamics are taken into account. Five main influential effects (asymmetric price effect, neighborhood price effect, asymmetric share effect, neighborhood share effect, and private label versus national brand asymmetry) appear jointly in the second layer of a pooled HB-VEC-VARX model, together with brand- and category-specific variables. This study tests the relative importance of these key factors across three scenarios: with no market dynamics, when only consumer dynamics are considered, and when competitive reactions are also taken into account. The results confirm all five influential effects, even if they are jointly estimated, and consumer and competitive dynamics are taken into account. National brand/private label asymmetry has the strongest influence on the cross-price promotional effects and becomes significantly stronger when consumer and competitive dynamics are taken into account. Dynamic consumer responses and competitive reactions both affect cross-brand price elasticities, and contrary to expectations, competitive reactions accumulate rather than diminish cross-price elasticities. Preemptive switching does occur; i.e., a brand's promotion in period t hurts a competitor's sales in subsequent periods. Our findings are based on an extensive data set.

We test the framework using data collected from computer-aided text analysis, expert coders, and secondary sources for 543 IPOs across 43 industries between 2000 and 2004. A Bayesian shrinkage model, which accounts for industry-specific effects and uses latent instrumental variables to address CCO endogeneity, shows that CCOs positively influence IPO outcomes. Furthermore, (1) underwriter reputation and venture funding positively moderate the effects of CCOs; (2) technological and market turbulence positively and institutional complexity negatively moderate the effect of customer orientation; and (3) technological turbulence, competitive intensity, and institutional complexity positively moderate the effect of competitor orientation.

In this paper, we incorporate consumers' concerns of peer-induced price fairness into a model of price competition and show that a uniform price for branded variants may emerge in equilibrium. Interestingly, we find that uniform pricing induced by consumers' concerns of fairness can actually help mitigate price competition and hence increase firms' profits if the demand of the product category is expandable. Furthermore, an individual firm may not have an incentive to unilaterally mitigate consumers' concerns of price fairness to its own branded variants, which suggests the long-run sustainability of the uniform pricing strategy. As a result, fairness concerns from consumers provide a natural mechanism for firms to commit to uniform pricing and enhance their profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0751","","MKS","Marketing","5","['fairness', 'price fairness', 'consumer concerns']","The article discusses consumer concerns about price fairness, which indicates a moderate focus on ethical considerations within a business context.

Scoring relies on ordered lists of probabilities that customers act in a way that contributes revenues, e.g., purchase something from the firm. Targeting identifies constrained sets of covariate patterns associated with high probabilities of these acts. Influencing aims at changing the probabilities that individual customers act accordingly through marketing activities. We show that successful targeting and influencing decisions require inference that controls for endogenous selection, whereas scoring can proceed relatively successfully based on simpler models that provide (local) approximations, capitalizing on spurious effects of observed covariates. To facilitate the type of inference required for targeting and influencing, we develop a prior that frees the analyst from having to specify (often arbitrary) exclusion restrictions for model identification a priori or to explicitly compare all possible models. We cover exclusions of observed as well as unobserved covariates that may cause the successive selections to be dependent. We automatically infer the dependence structure among selection stages using Markov chain Monte Carlo-based variable selection, before identifying the scale of latent variables. The adaptive parsimony achieved through our prior is particularly helpful in applications where the number of successive selections exceeds two, a relevant but underresearched situation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0754","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer scoring and marketing decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such purchases are characterized by limited repeat purchase behavior of the same product item (such as a book title) but significant past usage experience with other products of the same type (such as books of the same genre). To cope with the uncertainty in quality of the product item, we posit that consumers may learn from their experience with the same type of product and others' experiences with the product item. We model the review credibility as the precision with which product reviews reflect the consumer's own product evaluation. The higher the precision, the more credible the information obtained from product reviews for the consumer, and the larger the effect of reviews on the consumer's choice probabilities. We extend the Bayesian learning framework to model consumer learning on both product quality and review credibility. We apply the model to a panel data set of 1,919 book purchases by 243 consumers. We find that consumers learn more from online reviews of book titles than from their own experience with other books of the same genre. In the counterfactual analysis, we illustrate the profit impact of product reviews and how it varies with the number of reviews. We also study the phenomenon of fake reviews. We find that fake reviews increase consumer uncertainty. The effects of more positive reviews and more numerous reviews on consumer choice are smaller on online retailing platforms that have fake product reviews.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0755","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'reviews', 'fake reviews']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and the impact of online reviews on purchasing decisions, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We find that although the effect of requests on prescriptions is significantly positive, the mean effect of DTCA on patient requests is negative, yet very small. More interestingly, both effects show substantial heterogeneity across physicians, which we uncover using a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure. We find that specialists receive more requests than primary care physicians but translate them less into prescriptions. In addition, we find that the sociodemographic profile of the area a physician practices in moderates the effects of DTCA on requests and of requests on prescriptions. For instance, physicians from areas with a higher proportion of minorities (i.e., blacks and Hispanics) receive more requests that are less triggered by DTCA and are accomodated less frequently than physicians from areas with a lower proportion of minorities. Our results challenge managers to revisit the role of DTCA in stimulating patient requests.

Several findings emerge. First, \u201cpricing\u201d and \u201cgame theory\u201d are the most ubiquitous words. More generally, the three C's and four P's predominate, suggesting that keywords and common practical frameworks align. Various trends exist. Some words, like \u201cpricing,\u201d remain popular over time. Others, like \u201cgame theory\u201d and \u201chierarchical Bayes,\u201d have become more popular. Finally, some words are superseded by others, like \u201cdiffusion\u201d by \u201csocial networking.\u201d Second, the overall rate of new keyword introductions has increased, but the likelihood they will remain in use has decreased. This suggests a maturation of the discipline or a long-tail effect. Third, a correspondence analysis indicates three distinct eras of marketing modeling, comporting roughly with each of the past three decades. These eras are driven by the emergence of new data and business problems, suggesting a fluid field responsive to practical problems. Fourth, we consider author publication survival rates, which increase up to six papers and then decline, possibly as a result of changes in ability or motivation. Fifth, survival rates vary with the recency and nature of words.

Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called Yellow Tail. Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market structure with the advances that have been made in assortment planning in operations research, assortment and stock-keeping-unit\u2013level modeling, mixed logits, and the marketing literature on the perceptions of variety of assortment to develop and estimate a model on readily available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance market share. These were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact on its brand ranking. In fact, in 2008, it debuted as sixth among the international wine brands. It also managed to play an important role in deposing Yellow Tail, the market share leader, from its dominant position. We conclude the paper by providing examples of other companies where this approach has also been successfully implemented and by discussing some avenues for future research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0746","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of category management and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By restricting its handsets to one service provider, a handset vendor may be able to induce a rival handset vendor to compete less aggressively. At the same time, the service provider may be able to essentially raise a rival service provider's handset costs by limiting the handsets available to the rival. Interestingly, the handset vendor's market share may be higher when its handset is sold exclusively than when it is not. Our results might explain why EHAs seem more attractive in some markets than in others, why some service providers have exclusive arrangements even for handset models that do not seem popular, and how some handset vendors enjoy high market shares despite having many exclusive models.

We refer to this behavior as media multiplexing and note that key challenges for integrated marketing communications media planners are (1) predicting which media or combination of media their target audience is likely to consume at any given time and (2) understanding potential substitutions and complementarities in their joint consumption. We propose a forecasting model that incorporates media-multiplexing behavior of both traditional and new media, their interdependencies, and consumer heterogeneity, and we calibrate the model using a rich database of individual-specific media activity diaries. The results suggest that accounting for media synergies within a single utility specification significantly improves model forecasts. We also introduce a utility function that directly models cross-channel media complementarities via interactive effects of the satiation parameters of own and joint consumption of various media types. Finally, our individual-level analyses generate unique insights on consumer-level media switching, multiplexing, and individual heterogeneity often ignored in aggregate data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0759","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer heterogeneity', 'media planning', 'target audience']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of media consumption and marketing strategies without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

But given that such communications can affect rivals' incentives to develop the same new product, a firm may decide to preannounce untruthfully in order to deter competitors. We examine an incumbent's preannouncement strategy when there is uncertainty regarding the commercial viability of a new product opportunity and a threat of rival entry. Each firm has a private assessment of the market potential for the new product. Two competitive incentives arise for the incumbent in terms of discouraging rival entry: it can use preemptive communication or it can remain silent and instill a pessimistic market potential outlook. We find that an incumbent prefers to follow a vaporware strategy\u2014i.e., declares plans to pursue a new product opportunity even when it may have no development intentions\u2014when its market forecasting capabilities are weak and the demand-side benefits from preannouncing are small. By contrast, when the incumbent has strong market forecasting capabilities and the demand-side benefits are small, the incumbent adopts a suddenware strategy\u2014i.e., remains silent about its new product plans even when it actually plans to develop the new product. Finally, when its market forecasting capabilities are strong and the demand-side benefits are large, the incumbent prefers to engage in a trueware strategy\u2014i.e., truthfully preannounces development plans. We show that an interplay between competition-related and demand-related considerations is what allows trueware to emerge as an equilibrium in the absence of any ex post cost to engaging in vaporware. In an extension, we let the incumbent's actual development plans leak out and allow the entrant to wait and learn those plans prior to setting a research and development level. We identify conditions for the entrant to postpone development despite the risk of being late to market, as well as conditions for the entrant to commence development immediately despite not knowing the incumbent's plans based on the observed preannouncement strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0762","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market strategies and product preannouncements without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We then link WOM to the actual sales that it generates through a second metric, customer influence value (CIV), and we implement a strategy at Hokey Pokey to measure these metrics and identify their individual drivers. Finally, we refine our strategy to increase CIE and CIV, thereby impacting the profit.

Patient-mediated learning is aided by the use of free drug samples. The effective use of samples is hampered by a lack of understanding of its exact return on investment implications. We seek to fill this gap by incorporating the physician's sample allocation behavior in the firm's decision making. We uncover the following implications for firms as well as policy makers. First, we find that the optimal sampling level for a drug category is a nonmonotonic function of patient payment ability and the price of the drug. Second, an increase in the cost of samples can lead to an increase in sampling and a decrease in detailing when the physician's propensity to provide sample subsidies is high. Third, when future market growth is expected to be high (early stage product life cycle and/or chronic drugs) and sampling efficiency is low, the use of sampling is profitable for the firm but leads to lower market coverage than when sampling is disallowed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0743","","MKS","Marketing","2","['patient payment', 'physician learning', 'drug samples']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of pharmaceutical sampling and physician behavior, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In these relationships the negotiations are interdependent, and bargaining externality may arise across the retailers. In addition, the timing by which the manufacturer negotiates with the retailers becomes important. In simultaneous bargaining the retailers negotiate without knowing if an agreement has been reached in the other retail channel, whereas in sequential bargaining the retailer in the second negotiation is able to observe whether an agreement was reached in the first negotiation. We show that simultaneous bargaining is optimal for the manufacturer when the retail prices (and profitability) are similar, and sequential bargaining is preferred when the dispersion in the retail prices is sufficiently large. As a result of ex post renegotiations, the manufacturer may strategically stock out the less profitable retailer who charged a relatively low retail price and exclusively supply only the retailer who charged a relatively high retail price and maintained high channel profitability. Moreover, ex post multilateral bargaining can buffer downstream competition and thus lead to positive retail profits even in markets that are close to perfect competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0766","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of multilateral bargaining and competition in retail without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on noncommercial users who do not benefit financially from their contributions. Previous literature suggests that there are two main types of utility that motivate these users to post content: intrinsic utility and image-related utility. We leverage the fact that these two types of utility give rise to different predictions as to whether users should increase their contributions when their number of followers increases. To address the issue that the number of followers is endogenous, we conducted a field experiment in which we exogenously added followers (or follow requests, in the case of protected accounts) to a set of users over a period of time and compared their posting activities to those of a control group. We estimated each treated user's utility function using a dynamic discrete choice model. Although our results are consistent with both types of utility being at play, our model suggests that image-related utility is larger for most users. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of Twitter and the type of value firms may derive from such platforms in the future.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0773","","MKS","Marketing","2","['social media', 'utility', 'contribute', 'noncommercial']","The article primarily focuses on the motivations behind content contribution on social media without addressing any social justice or ethical themes.

Adopting the commonality strategy may lower a firm's manufacturing costs, but it blurs the distinction between products targeting different consumer segments and makes consumer switching between products more likely such that cannibalization is always intensified. We show that this view in the literature is based on a crucial assumption that the quality valuation of one consumer segment is greater than that of another segment for all product attributes; i.e., one segment's preference structure dominates the other segment's preference structure. In this paper we consider the case of a nondominating preference structure where each segment has an attribute it values more than the other segment does. Interestingly, we show that the effect of commonality strategy is more diverse in this nondominating preference structure and that commonality can actually relieve cannibalization in the product line design. This finding gives rise to a previously unrecognized opportunity for firms to redesign their product lines to improve profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0774","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer segments', 'preference structure', 'cannibalization']","The article primarily focuses on product line design and cost savings without addressing social justice or ethical considerations.

We propose a reduced-form model-based analytical approach to identify categories that fill the destination role. Our approach determines which categories are most important to shoppers' store choice decisions and helps determine in which categories the retailer provides superior value. In addition, our approach allows us to understand the impact of the retailer's long-run merchandising policy decisions on the value it provides. Previous store choice research considered the effects of pricing, assortment and other merchandising decisions at the store level but did not focus on the effect of specific categories on store choice. This focus leads us to formulate a model that can (1) measure and explain the differential impact that specific categories have on shoppers' store choice decisions and (2) measure the relative value of retailers' category offerings, partitioning that value into the component resulting from retailer merchandising and the component that is nonmerchandising related. The model form captures differences in category value across stores (i.e., the store's category positioning) by specifying a spatial model for the store choice and category incidence intercepts. Our spatial model recognizes that stores position their offering vis-\u00e0-vis the category ideal based on long-run category merchandising decisions and that not all categories have the same importance in store choice decisions. We explore these issues for five retailers in the Charlotte, North Carolina market. We find that (1) category impact on store choice is highly skewed; (2) although categories with higher sales generally have a higher impact on store choice decisions, there are exceptions; (3) impact on store choice decisions does not vary systematically by the type of category (e.g., perishable versus dry grocery); and (4) our measure of category impact on store choice, although correlated with the category development index between retailers, is superior in that it provides a basis for comparing category impact within a retailer and how relative category value, based on long-run merchandising decisions, attracts shoppers to a store.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0775","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing and store choice without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The Role of Context-Dependent Preferences","Laboratory and field experiments show that when choosing among a set of objects, consumers could be subjected to context-dependent preferences and evaluate options by considering both the absolute utilities and their relative standing in the choice set. Using this premise we construct a game-theoretic model of competition between two firms and investigate how a firm's decision to differentiate or imitate is affected when consumers' preferences are context-dependent. We consider two horizontally differentiated firms where some consumers own the product of one firm and the rest own the other firm's product. One firm upgrades its existing product by adding a new feature. In the absence of any cost or capability constraints, to protect its competitive position, the other firm would prefer to upgrade its product by adding a differentiated new feature. We show that if consumers' preferences are context-dependent and the new feature is of an incremental type, the second mover prefers to imitate the first mover by adding the same feature even when there is no cost disadvantage to differentiate itself. This happens because context-dependent preferences cause consumers to dislike brands that are very differentiated from one another. Thus, if the second mover mimics the first mover, both firms can charge higher prices for their upgraded products (i.e., imitation leads to higher prices). This outcome, in turn, leads the first mover to pick a new feature such that it would induce the second mover to imitate. Therefore, our analysis shows that the need for context management leads not just to imitation but also to accommodating imitation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0776","","MKS","Marketing","2","['preferences', 'context-dependent', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and competition without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Measuring asymmetric effects is difficult when all that is observed are the purchase quantities present in a consumer's market basket. We propose a direct utility model with a latent decision sequence for measuring asymmetric effects that allows us to capture differential responses to cross-category purchases and inventories.

This paper addresses the following question: What happens to the \u201cproduct differentiation\u2013collusion sustainability\u201d relationship when setting up and maintaining an agreement is costly? We show that introducing collusion costs into the discussion has relevant implications. Indeed, sufficiently high collusion costs modify the underlying market structure, thus altering the product differentiation\u2013collusion sustainability relationship with respect to the case where collusion costs are absent or low. In particular, if the gains from collusion are increasing (decreasing) with the degree of product differentiation, the relationship between product differentiation and collusion sustainability is always positive (negative), whereas if the gains from collusion are inverted U-shaped, the relationship is inverted U-shaped too. These results stress the importance of considering those markets where the coordination between firms is sufficiently costly as structurally different from those markets where coordination has no costs for firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1120.0750","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on product differentiation and collusion in a profit-driven context without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The model describes how advertising can be both informative to consumers and profitable for the firm through its content in a vertically differentiated market. I find that advertising content may be effective in inducing search even if incentives for misrepresentation exist. In particular, a firm with an undesirable (low-quality) product is able to attract consumers who would have not incurred a search cost had they known its true quality. In this case, a semiseparating equilibrium occurs where the lowest firm types pool upward in order to increase the expected product quality while simultaneously signaling that the product is affordable. Although consumers always benefit from truth in advertising, total welfare may decrease if an undesirable firm is required to reveal its type.

A retailer can display competing products in the same location, allowing consumers to inspect various products all at once or in distant locations, which induces consumers to inspect one product first and then decide whether to incur the travel cost to inspect another product. We consider a model in which two competing manufacturers distribute two horizontally differentiated products through a common retailer. Our analysis shows when the two manufacturers offer products of the same fit probabilities, the retailer obtains a greater profit by displaying competing products in distant locations if the products' fit probabilities are not too high; otherwise, the retailer is better off displaying competing products in the same location. When manufacturers offer products of differentiated fit probabilities, a retailer is more likely to benefit from displaying competing products in distant locations with an increased fit difference between products.

Users of these surveys are often interested in the relationship between global satisfaction and attributes; regression analysis is commonly used to measure the conditional associations. Regression analysis is only appropriate when the global satisfaction measure results from the attribute evaluations and is not appropriate when the covariance of the items lie in a low-dimensional subspace, such as in a factor model. Potential reasons for low-dimensional responses are that responses may be haloed from overall satisfaction and there may be an unintended lack of item specificity. In this paper we develop a Bayesian mixture model that facilitates the empirical distinction between regression models and relatively much lower-dimensional factor models. The model uses the dimensionality of the covariance among items in a survey as the primary classification criterion while accounting for the heterogeneous usage of rating scales. We apply the model to four different customer satisfaction surveys that evaluate hospitals, an academic program, smartphones, and theme parks, respectively. We show that correctly assessing the heterogeneous dimensionality of responses is critical for meaningful inferences by comparing our results to those from regression models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0779","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer satisfaction surveys and regression analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of woke themes."],["2013","32","4","Ron BermanRon Bermanron_berman@haas.berkeley.eduHaas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720Search for more papers by this author, Zsolt KatonaZsolt Katonazskatona@haas.berkeley.eduHaas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720Search for more papers by this author","The Role of Search Engine Optimization in Search Marketing","This paper examines the impact of search engine optimization (SEO) on the competition between advertisers for organic and sponsored search results. The results show that a positive level of search engine optimization may improve the search engine's ranking quality and thus the satisfaction of its visitors. In the absence of sponsored links, the organic ranking is improved by SEO if and only if the quality provided by a website is sufficiently positively correlated with its valuation for consumers. In the presence of sponsored links, the results are accentuated and hold regardless of the correlation. When sponsored links serve as a second chance to acquire clicks from the search engine, low-quality websites have a reduced incentive to invest in SEO, giving an advantage to their high-quality counterparts. As a result of the high expected quality on the organic side, consumers begin their search with an organic click. Although SEO can improve consumer welfare and the payoff of high-quality sites, we find that the search engine's revenues are typically lower when advertisers spend more on SEO and thus less on sponsored links. Modeling the impact of the minimum bid set by the search engine reveals an inverse U-shaped relationship between the minimum bid and search engine profits, suggesting an optimal minimum bid that is decreasing in the level of SEO activity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0783","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of search engine optimization and its impact on competition and consumer welfare without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Recently, these sectors have witnessed the growing popularity of peer-to-peer Web-based used goods markets as important transaction channels between buyers and sellers. Given that these two issues are critically linked from both supply and demand perspectives, in this paper we study the role that consumer valuation of used products plays in shaping a manufacturer's incentive to offer a returns policy option to a retailer when used goods might be devalued compared to new ones as a result of physical deterioration (or obsolescence). We do so through a two-period dyadic channel framework where the retailer faces uncertain demand for a durable product from a renewable set of customers who are impatient but forward looking. The manufacturer, on the other hand, needs to decide whether or not to offer a returns contract to the retailer. We first characterize the necessary and sufficient condition under which a returns contract is the equilibrium strategy as well as the corresponding channel decisions. Further analysis of this condition reveals that a higher consumer valuation of used products increases the likelihood of a returns contract being the equilibrium strategy. This result seems to be robust except when the potential demands for the two periods are quite deterministic and uncorrelated. However, it contradicts the burgeoning managerial trend to replace returns contracts with price-only ones in sectors where used goods are valued relatively highly by the consumers. We also discuss how used goods markets affect the equilibrium channel decisions as well as how demand uncertainty and logistics costs associated with returns influence the equilibrium contracting strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0784","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of returns policies and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

With strict complements, a consumer derives positive utility only when both products are used together. We show that value-capture and value-creation problems arise when such products are developed and sold by separate firms (\u201cnonintegrated\u201d producers). Although the firms tend to price higher for given quality levels, their provision of quality is so low that, in equilibrium, prices are set well below what an integrated monopolist would choose. When one firm can mandate a royalty fee from the complementor producer (as often occurs in arrangements between hardware and software makers), we find that the value-capture problem is mitigated to some extent and consumer surplus rises. However, because royalty fees greatly reduce the incentives of the firm paying them to invest in quality, the arrangement exacerbates the value-creation problem and leads to even lower total quality. Surprisingly, this result can reverse with competition. Specifically, when the firm charging the royalty fee faces a vertically differentiated competitor, the value-creation problem is greatly reduced\u2014opening the door for the possibility of a Pareto-improving outcome in which all firms and consumers benefit. It is worth noting that this outcome cannot be achieved by giving firms the option of introducing a line of product variants; competition serves as a necessary \u201ccommitment\u201d ingredient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0785","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the strategic interaction between firms and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although the presence of SBs benefits both consumers and retailers, it is a threat to the dominance of the incumbent national brand manufacturers (NBMs). When considering the potential threat of an SB, an NBM generally pursues one of three strategies: accommodate, displace, or buffer. Under the accommodation strategy, the NBM repositions the products in his existing product line. Under the displacement strategy, the NBM elects to supply the SB to preempt the entry of the SB supplier. Under the buffering strategy, the NBM adds a defender product, which competes with his own product offering and the new SB. Using a game-theoretic model, we consider a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of product quality and analyze an NBM's response to an SB threat. We focus on two important drivers: the NBM's ability to differentiate on the quality dimensions and his cost advantage over the outside supplier of SB. To completely characterize the NBM's response, we consider two regimes. In the first regime, the NBM is a monopolist producer. In the second regime, the retailer has the added option of procuring an SB product from an independent, nonstrategic SB manufacturer. By comparing the results from both regimes, we develop a descriptive theory that clarifies the incentives of the NBM to accommodate, displace, or buffer. In doing this, we determine how the NBM's whole product portfolio should be designed, i.e., the positioning (quality levels) and prices of all its offerings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0788","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive strategies between national brands and store brands, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We consider models involving an existing measure of information processing, PATTERN; a latent variable version of this measure; and several new refinements and generalizations. Analysis of a unique data set of 895 shoppers on a popular electronics website supports the latent variable specification and provides validation for several hypotheses and modeling components. We find a positive relationship between alternative-based processing and purchase, as well as a tendency of shoppers in the lower price category to engage in alternative-based processing. The results also support the case for joint modeling and estimation. These findings can be useful for future work in information processing and suggest that likely buyers can be identified while engaged in information processing prior to purchase commitment, an important first step in targeting decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0790","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and information processing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Products such as Cola-Cola, Tide laundry detergent, and Chapstick lip balm are the prototypical products in their respective categories. For more than three decades, research in consumer psychology has accumulated evidence on how prototypicality influences memory, shapes the composition of consideration set, and affects purchase decision. Yet there is no research on how it changes the competitive behavior of firms in a horizontally differentiated market. For example, some prototypical products are priced lower than other products in their category, whereas in certain other categories the prototypical product is priced higher. We propose a novel model of spatial competition, where the prototypicality of a product influences the probability of the product being included in consumers' consideration sets without affecting its valuation. Using the model, we examine theoretically the impact of prototypicality on the pricing decisions of competing firms. Our analysis shows that when consumer valuations are low, the prototypical product is priced lower than a nonprototypical product and earns more profits. However, when consumer valuations are high, the rank order of the prices of the prototypical product and a nonprototypical product is reversed, but not the order of profits. We subject these predictions to an empirical test. The experimental results lend support for the qualitative predictions of the model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0793","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer psychology and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model that accommodates heterogeneity in preferences for school quality and athletic success, as well as an extensive set of school fixed effects to control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I estimate the impact of athletic success on applicant quality and quantity. Overall, athletic success has a significant, long-term goodwill effect on future applications and quality. However, students with lower-than-average SAT scores tend to have a stronger preference for athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater preference for academic quality. Furthermore, the decay rate of athletics' goodwill is significant only for students with lower SAT scores, suggesting that the goodwill created by intercollegiate athletics resides more extensively with lower-scoring students than with their higher-scoring counterparts.

This insight reverses the direction of causality in the existing literature, wherein only status considerations matter and mere price increases may enhance consumer utility. Second, our dynamic model indicates that where consumers prioritize status benefits, producers incur substantial price depreciation in equilibrium.

This paper develops an implementable and scalable assortment optimization method that allows for theory-based substitution patterns and optimizes real-life, large-scale assortments at the store level. We achieve this by adopting an attribute-based approach to capture preferences, substitution patterns, and cross-marketing mix effects. To solve the optimization problem, we propose new very large neighborhood search heuristics. We apply our methodology to store-level scanner data on liquid laundry detergent. The optimal assortments are expected to enhance retailer profit considerably (37.3%), and this profit increases even more (to 43.7%) when SKU prices are optimized simultaneously.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0800","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on profit maximization and technical optimization methods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We consider how various creatives in a campaign differentially affect behavior given the targeted individual's ad impression history, as characterized by the timing and mix of previously seen ad creatives. Specifically, we examine the impact that each ad impression has on visiting and conversion behavior at the advertised brand's website. We accommodate both observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity and take into account correlations among the rates of ad impressions, website visits, and conversions. We also allow for the accumulation and decay of advertising effects, as well as ad wearout and restoration effects. Our results highlight the importance of accommodating both the existence of multiple ad creatives in an ad campaign and the impact of an individual's ad impression history. Simulation results suggest that online advertisers can increase the number of website visits and conversions by varying the creative content shown to an individual according to that person's history of previous ad impressions. For our data, we show a 12.7% increase in the expected number of visits and a 13.8% increase in the expected number of conversions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0802","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online advertising without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

It is especially important when the information that is conveyed pertains to experience attributes, i.e., attributes of products that cannot be fully verified prior to the first purchase. Experience attributes are prevalent and salient when consumers shop through catalogs, on home shopping networks, and over the Internet. Firms therefore employ creative and sometimes costly methods to help consumers resolve uncertainty; we argue that uncertainty can be partially resolved through social learning processes that occur naturally and emanate from local neighborhood characteristics. Using data from Bonobos, a leading U.S. online fashion retailer, we find not only that local social learning facilitates customer trial but also that the effect is economically important because about half of all trials were partially attributable to it. Merging data from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, we find that neighborhood social capital, i.e., the propensity for neighbors to trust each other and communicate with each other, enhances the social learning process and makes it more efficient. Social capital does not operate on trials directly; rather, it improves the learning process and therefore indirectly drives sales when what is communicated is favorable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0796","","MKS","Marketing","3","['social capital', 'trust', 'communication']","The article discusses social learning and neighborhood social capital, which touch on community dynamics and interpersonal trust.

We demonstrate that firms can be better off in shrinking markets and worse off in growing markets, even in the absence of competitive entry or exit. Specifically, firms may benefit if a segment of consumers who are relatively indifferent about consuming any product in the category leave the market. Profits can increase for all firms even if the exiting consumers have strong preferences for only one of the products in the market. In shrinking markets, it is reasonable to assume that the people who are likely to exit the market first are people who are \u201cleast committed\u201d to the category. In particular, people who are the least satisfied with the existing offers are the most likely to change their behavior by finding an alternative or adopting a new technology. Similarly, in growing markets, consumers who enter the market late are generally the least committed to the category. Such exiting can relax the competitive pressure between firms and lead to increased profitability.

Although freelancing has grown in recent years, it faces the classic \u201cinformation asymmetry\u201d problem\u2014buyers face uncertainty over seller quality. Typically, these markets use reputation systems to alleviate this issue, but the effectiveness of these systems is open to debate. We present a dynamic structural framework to estimate the returns to seller reputations in freelance sites. In our model, a buyer decides in each period whether to choose a bid from her current set of bids, cancel the auction, or wait for more bids. In the process, she trades off sellers' price, reputation, and other attributes, as well as the costs of waiting and canceling. Our framework addresses dynamic selection, which can lead to underestimation of reputation, through two types of persistent unobserved heterogeneities: bid arrival rates and buyers' unobserved preference for bids. We apply our framework to data from a leading freelance firm. We find that buyers are forward looking, that they place significant weight on seller reputation, and that not controlling for dynamics and selection can bias reputation estimates. Using counterfactual simulations, we infer the dollar value of seller reputations and provide guidelines to managers of freelance firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0809","","MKS","Marketing","2","['reputation', 'freelance', 'buyers', 'sellers']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of reputation systems in freelance marketplaces without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Does correlation in consumer valuations make bundling more or less effective? Does bundling serve as a complement or substitute to network effects? To address these questions, we develop a consumer-choice model from microfoundations to capture the essentials of our setting, the handheld video game market. We provide a framework to understand the dynamic, long-term effects of bundling on demand. The primary explanation for the profitability of bundling relies on homogenization of consumer valuations for the bundle, allowing the firm to extract more surplus. We find that bundling can be effective through a novel and previously unexamined mechanism of dynamic consumer segmentation, which operates independent of the homogenization effect, and can in fact be stronger when the homogenization effect is weaker. We also find that bundles are treated as separate products (distinct from component products) by consumers. Sales of both hardware and software components decrease in the absence of bundling, and consumers who had previously purchased bundles might delay purchases, resulting in lower revenues. We also find that mixed bundling dominates pure bundling and pure components in terms of both hardware and software revenues. Investigating the link between bundling and indirect network effects, we find that they act as substitute strategies, with a lower relative effectiveness for bundling when network effects are stronger.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0810","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing strategy related to bundling and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We conduct a novel field experiment to induce and observe choice interdependence in a closed social network. In our experiment, we conceptualize individuals' choices to be driven by multiattribute utilities, and we measure their initial attribute preferences prior to observing their choice interdependence and collecting network information. These design elements help alleviate concerns in identifying social interaction effects from other confounds. Given that we have complete information on choices and their sequence, we use a discrete-time Markov chain model. Nonetheless, we also use a Markov random field (MRF) model as an alternative when the information on choice sequence is missing. We find significant social interaction effects. Our findings show that whereas experts exert asymmetrically greater influence on a technology-related product, popular individuals exert greater influence on a fashion-related product. In addition, we find choices made by early decision makers to be more influential than choices made later for the technology-related product. Finally, using the MRF with snapshot data can also provide good out-of-sample predictions for a technology-related product.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2013.0811","","MKS","Marketing","2","['influence', 'social network', 'choices']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of choice interdependence in social networks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The novel factor is a scaled cash-flow factor that results from the interaction between cash-flow news and a lagged state variable (market dividend yield or consumer price index inflation). The cross-sectional tests over 10 portfolios sorted on size, 10 portfolios sorted on book-to-market, and 10 portfolios sorted on momentum show that the scaled ICAPM explains relatively well the dispersion in excess returns on the 30 portfolios. The results for an alternative set of equity portfolios (25 portfolios sorted on size and momentum) show that the scaled ICAPM prices particularly well the momentum portfolios. Moreover, the scaled ICAPM compares favorably with alternative asset pricing models in pricing both sets of equity portfolios. The scaled factor is decisive to account for the dispersion in average excess returns between past winner and past loser stocks. More specifically, past winners are riskier than past losers in times of high price of risk. Therefore, a time-varying cash-flow beta/price of risk provides a rational explanation for momentum.

In contrast with classical mixed-integer formulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we consider only a finite set of power values. This has two major advantages: it better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems that heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the generalized upper bound (GUB) cover inequalities introduced by Wolsey [Wolsey L (1990) Valid inequalities for 0-1 knapsacks and mips with generalised upper bound constraints. Discrete Appl. Math. 29(2\u20133):251\u2013261]; and its core is an extension of the exact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints.

We investigate how information asymmetry and procurement contracting strategies interact to influence the supply chain parties' incentives to collaborate. We consider a number of procurement contracting strategies, and identify a simple strategy, expected margin commitment (EMC), that effectively promotes collaboration. The manufacturer prefers EMC if collaboration leads to a large reduction in unit cost and/or demand variability is low. Otherwise, a screening contract based on price and quantity is preferred.

Our paper analyzes how to dynamically manage this accuracy/congestion trade-off. To that end, we study an elementary congested system facing an arriving stream of customers. The diagnostic process consists of a search problem in which the service provider conducts a sequence of imperfect tests to determine the customer's type. We find that the agent should continue to perform the diagnosis as long as her current belief that the customer is of a given type falls into an interval that depends on the congestion level as well as the number of performed tests thus far. This search interval should shrink as congestion intensifies and as the number of performed tests increases if additional conditions hold. Our study reveals that, contrary to diagnostic services without congestion, the base rate (i.e., the prior probability of the customer type) has an effect on the agent's search strategy. In particular, the optimal search interval shrinks when customer types are more ambiguous a priori, i.e., as the base rate approaches the value at which the agent is indifferent between types. Finally, because of congestion effects, the agent should sometimes diagnose the customer as being of a given type, even if test results indicate otherwise. All these insights disappear in the absence of congestion.

Manufacturers, policy makers, and researchers all claim that inadequate piracy enforcement efforts translate to lower investments in product development. However, we find many practical examples that contradict this claim. Therefore, to examine this claim more carefully, we develop a rigorous economic model of the manufacturer's quality decision problem in the presence of piracy. We consider a monopolist who does not have any marginal costs but has a product development cost quadratic in the quality level produced. The monopolist faces a consumer market heterogeneous in its preference for quality and offers a quality level that maximizes its profit. We also allow for the possibility that the manufacturer may use versioning to counter piracy. We unexpectedly find that in certain situations, lower piracy enforcement increases the monopolist's incentive to invest in quality. We explain the reasons and welfare implications of our findings.

We first examine the effect of three dimensions of IT architecture flexibility (open communication standards, cross-functional transparency, and modularity) on formation of three types of alliances (arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture alliances, respectively). Then, we examine how capabilities in IT flexibility can enhance the value derived from alliances. Our sample includes data from 169 firms that are publicly listed in the United States and that span multiple industries. We find that adoption of open communication standards is associated with the formation of arm's-length alliances, and modularity of IT architecture is associated with the formation of joint ventures. We also find that IT architecture flexibility enhances the value of arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture alliances. The contribution of IT flexibility to value is greater in the case of collaborative alliances than in arm's-length alliances.

Affirmative Action in Light of Gender Differences in Competitiveness","Affirmative action is often criticized for causing reverse discrimination and lowering the qualifications of those hired under the policy. However, the magnitude of such adverse effects depends on whether the best suited candidate is hired absent the policy. Indeed affirmative action may compensate for the distortion discrimination imposes on the selection of candidates. This paper asks whether affirmative action can have a similar corrective impact when qualified individuals fail to apply for a job. We evaluate the effect of introducing a gender quota in an environment where high-performing women fail to enter competitions they can win. We show that guaranteeing women equal representation among winners increases their entry. The response exceeds that predicted by the change in probability of winning and is in part driven by women being more willing to compete against other women.

These difficulties are compounded when the portfolio contains derivatives. We develop two tractable conservative approximations for the VaR of a derivative portfolio by evaluating the worst-case VaR over all return distributions of the derivative underliers with given first- and second-order moments. The derivative returns are modelled as convex piecewise linear or\u2014by using a delta\u2013gamma approximation\u2014as (possibly nonconvex) quadratic functions of the returns of the derivative underliers.

We study this question in the context of the software industry, an environment where evidence of the efficacy of IPR as a mechanism to appropriate the returns from innovation has been mixed. Entry, in our context, is measured by an independent software vendor's (ISV's) decision to become certified by a platform owner and produce applications compatible with the platform. We find that ISVs with a greater stock of formal IPR (such as patents and copyrights), and those with stronger downstream capabilities (as measured by trademarks and consulting services) are more likely to join the platform, suggesting that these mechanisms are effective in protecting ISVs from the threat of expropriation. We also find that the effects of IPR on the likelihood of partnership are greater when an ISV has weak downstream capabilities or when the threat of imitation is greater, such as when the markets served by the ISV are growing quickly.

Affirmative Action in Light of Gender Differences in Competitiveness (p. 1) Muriel Niederle, Carmit Segal, Lise Vesterlund Do two wrongs make a right? Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, affirmative action has been used to compensate for the distortion that discrimination imposes on the selection of candidates. However, affirmative action has been often criticized for causing reverse discrimination and lowering the qualifications of those hired under the policy. But affirmative action could have a similar corrective impact when qualified individuals fail to apply for a job. The authors evaluate the effect of introducing a female gender quota in an environment where high-performing women fail to enter competitions they can win because they are discouraged. The authors show that guaranteeing women equal representation among winners increases their entry. The response exceeds that predicted by the change in probability of winning and is in part driven by women being more willing to compete against other women. The insight for management: Affirmative action helps more than it hurts; if employers choose the best candidate from a pool, affirmative action can boost the talent in the pool by encouraging broader participation.Judging Borrowers by the Company They Keep: Friendship Networks and Information Asymmetry in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending (p. 17) Mingfeng Lin, Nagpurnanand R. Prabhala, Siva Viswanathan Do popular people get all the breaks? The authors study the online market for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, in which individuals bid on unsecured microloans sought by other individual borrowers. The authors examine a large sample of consummated and failed listings from the largest online P2P lending marketplace, Prosper.com, and find that the online friendships of borrowers act as signals of credit quality. Friendships increase the probability of successful funding, lower interest rates on funded loans, and are associated with lower ex post default rates. The insight for management: Friendships in P2P markets are a good indicator of credit quality; more friends means lower probability of default.Buying Beauty: On Prices and Returns in the Art Market (p. 36) Luc Renneboog, Christophe Spaenjers Is beauty in the eye of the money holder? The Wall Street Journal estimated that approximately 6% of total wealth is held in \u201cpassion investments\u201d such as art. But what determines the value of art? For example, Claude Monet's Dans la Prairie sold for 11.2 million British pounds in 2009 after being sold for 14.3 million in 1988 and 15.4 million in 1999. The authors examine the price determinants and investment performance of art by statistical examination of more than one million auction transactions of paintings and works on paper. The authors conclude that art has appreciated in value by a moderate 3.97% per year, in real U.S. dollar terms, between 1957 and 2007\u2014a performance similar to that of corporate bonds\u2014at much higher risk. The authors find larger average price appreciations, but higher volatilities, in higher price brackets. The authors find that measures of high-income consumer confidence and art market sentiment predict art price trends. The insight for management: Buy art to hang on your wall, not to pay for your retirement.Performance Appraisals and the Impact of Forced Distribution\u2014An Experimental Investigation (p. 54) Johannes Berger, Christine Harbring, Dirk Sliwka Working hard, or hardly working? That is the question! As one might imagine, an employee's true efforts are at best imprecisely captured by objective figures. The authors conduct a real-effort experiment in which supervisors have to rate the performance of individual workers who in turn receive a bonus payment based on these ratings. They compare a baseline treatment in which supervisors are not restricted in their rating behavior to a forced distribution system in which they have to assign differentiated grades. They find that productivity is significantly higher under a forced distribution by approximately 6% to 12%. However, the productivity effects are less clear-cut when participants have prior experience with the system, and, worse, a forced distribution becomes detrimental when workers have access to a simple option to sabotage each other. The insight for management: Forced distribution evaluation improves effort but may also increase destructive competition between employees.The Advertising Mix for a Search Good (p. 69) Simon P. Anderson, R\u00e9gis Renault Want to know more? Call now! Advertising performs many functions, such as informing consumers, signaling quality, and confirming prices. But one key role of advertising is to excite potential consumers into learning more about the product. Advertising content might contain quality information, price information, and attributes to appeal to a certain subset of customers. But which of these does an advertiser stress to generate consumer interest in seeking more information? The authors find that first quality information is disclosed, then price information is revealed, and then \u201chorizontal product information\u201d (attributes that appeal to some consumer segments) is added to the advertising mix. The insight for management: A dynamic advertising strategy with changing emphases must be employed to garner maximal consumer interest in learning more about your product.Dynamic Pricing Competition with Strategic Customers Under Vertical Product Differentiation (p. 84) Qian Liu, Dan Zhang What to buy, and when to buy it? Consumers might choose to purchase not only between products, but also between points in time. What is the appropriate pricing strategy given these dynamics? The authors show that more thoughtful consumers can reduce the profit of firms, but lower-valuation customers are particularly adversely affected. Interestingly, if either firm can hold the line on prices, both firms are generally more profitable. This is particularly true if higher-quality firms can hold prices constant. The insight for management: Pricing games over time are less successful in the face of intelligent consumers; firms can be more profitable through simpler and less costly static pricing strategies.Appropriability Mechanisms and the Platform Partnership Decision: Evidence from Enterprise Software (p. 102) Peng Huang, Marco Ceccagnoli, Chris Forman, D. J. Wu How do intellectual property rights affect entry into the market for complementary applications from independent software providers? The authors examine whether ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) or downstream capabilities is effective in encouraging entry into markets complementary to a proprietary platform by preventing the platform owner from expropriating rents from start-ups. They study this question in the context of the software industry, an environment where evidence of the efficacy of IPR as a mechanism to appropriate the returns from innovation has been mixed. Entry is measured by an independent software vendor's (ISV's) decision to become certified by a platform owner and produce applications compatible with the platform. They find that ISVs with a greater stock of formal IPR (such as patents and copyrights), and those with stronger downstream capabilities (as measured by trademarks and consulting services) are more likely to join the platform, suggesting that these mechanisms are effective in protecting ISVs from the threat of expropriation. The insight for management: Careful use and distribution of intellectual property rights can encourage varying levels of participation in complementary product development.Intertemporal CAPM with Conditioning Variables (p. 122) Paulo Maio What factors might explain dispersion in excess returns? The author introduces a scaled cash-flow factor that results from the interaction between cash-flow news and lagged values of market dividend yield or consumer price index inflation. The author finds that the scaled ICAPM performs well in general, and prices particularly well the momentum portfolios. It compares favorably with alternative asset pricing models in pricing both sets of equity portfolios. Furthermore, the scaled factor is decisive to account for the dispersion in average excess returns between past winner and past loser stocks. The insight for management: A time-varying cash-flow beta/price of risk provides a rational explanation for momentum.GUB Covers and Power-Indexed Formulations for Wireless Network Design (p. 142) Fabio D'Andreagiovanni, Carlo Mannino, Antonio Sassano High-tech wireless networks such as the Internet, television, radio, and mobile communications depend on efficient network design. The authors provide a new approach to the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service coverage to a set of receivers that is quicker to solve and better matches the situation in practice. The insight for management: New modeling techniques make configuring wireless networks faster and more accurate.Diagnostic Accuracy Under Congestion (p. 157) Saed Alizamir, Francis de V\u00e9ricourt, Peng Sun Conduct a quick assessment or an accurate one? This is a tough choice faced by triage nurses, first-level technical support agents, and employees making maintenance decisions. In diagnostic services, agents typically need to weigh the benefit of running an additional test and improving the accuracy of diagnosis against the cost of delaying the provision of services to others. The authors analyze how to dynamically manage this accuracy/congestion trade-off. The diagnostic process consists of a search problem in which the service provider conducts a sequence of imperfect tests to determine the customer's type. They find that the agent should continue to perform the diagnosis as long as his current belief that the customer is of a given type falls into an interval that depends on the congestion level as well as the number of performed tests thus far. This search interval should shrink as congestion intensifies and as the number of performed tests increases if additional conditions hold. The authors find that the optimal search interval shrinks when customer types are more ambiguous a priori, i.e., as the base rate approaches the value at which the agent is indifferent between types. Surprisingly, because of congestion effects, the agent should sometimes diagnose the customer as being of a given type, even if test results indicate otherwise. The insight for management: Congestion affects optimal service times for triage-like diagnoses.Worst-Case Value at Risk of Nonlinear Portfolios (p. 172) Steve Zymler, Daniel Kuhn, Ber\u00e7 Rustem How should one allocate assets among investment alternatives when there is sizable downside risk? Value-at-risk (VaR) methods are used by regulators for evaluating such investments, but problems involving VaR are often computationally intractable and require complete information about the return distribution of the portfolio constituents, which is rarely available in practice. These difficulties are compounded when the portfolio contains derivatives. The authors offer two tractable conservative approximations for the VaR of a derivative portfolio. Their method offers approximations for portfolios containing long positions in European options expiring at the end of the investment horizon and one for portfolios containing long and/or short positions in European and/or exotic options expiring beyond the investment horizon. The insight for management: Advances in portfolio optimization with considerable downside risk allow for more tractable portfolio optimization.Collaborative Cost Reduction and Component Procurement Under Information Asymmetry (p. 189) Sang-Hyun Kim, Serguei Netessine How much should a manufacture rely on its suppliers? Many firms rely heavily on the expertise and resources provided by suppliers when developing new products. Japanese keiretsus are famous examples of heavily leveraging close relationships to gain success. During development of an innovative product there is often considerable uncertainty about component production cost, and it is of interest for both the manufacturer and the supplier to engage in a collaborative effort to reduce this uncertainty and lower the expected cost. Despite the obvious benefits that this brings, the supplier may be reluctant to collaborate because he fears revealing his proprietary cost information. The authors investigate how information asymmetry and procurement contracting strategies interact to influence the supply chain parties' incentives to collaborate. The authors identify a simple strategy, expected margin commitment (EMC), that effectively promotes collaboration. The manufacturer prefers EMC if collaboration leads to a large reduction in unit cost and/or demand variability is low. Otherwise, a screening contract based on price and quantity is preferred. The insight for management: Better collaboration in new product development can be attained through relatively simple strategies.The Effect of Information Technology\u2013Enabled Flexibility on Formation and Market Value of Alliances (p. 207) Ali Tafti, Sunil Mithas, M. S. Krishnan How can information technology (IT) affect the likelihood of success of alliances and joint ventures? Three dimensions of IT architecture flexibility (open communication standards, cross-functional transparency, and modularity) can have an effect on formation of three types of alliances (arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture). The authors examine how capabilities in IT flexibility can enhance the value derived from alliances. Through empirical analysis of 169 joint ventures, they find that adoption of open communication standards is associated with the formation of arm's-length alliances and that modularity of IT architecture is associated with the formation of joint ventures. They also find that IT architecture flexibility enhances the value of arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture alliances. The contribution of IT flexibility to value is greater in the case of collaborative alliances than in arm's-length alliances. The insight for management: Appropriate investments in IT can help to facilitate reconfiguration of resources and modification of processes in collaboration-intensive alliances.Crowdsourcing New Product Ideas over Time: An Analysis of the Dell IdeaStorm Community (p. 226) Barry L. Bayus \u201cCrowdsourcing\u201d is the practice of taking a task once performed by an employee and outsourcing it to a large, undefined group of people outside the company, usually customers. Several organizations have developed ongoing crowdsourcing communities that repeatedly collect ideas for new products and services from a large, dispersed \u201ccrowd\u201d of nonexperts (consumers) over time. Despite its promises, little is known about the nature of an individual's ideation efforts in such an online community. Studying Dell's IdeaStorm community, serial ideators are found to be more likely than singular ideators to generate an idea that the organization finds valuable enough to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success attempt to again come up with ideas that will excite the organization, they instead end up proposing ideas similar to their ideas that were already implemented (i.e., they generate less diverse ideas). The negative effects of past success are somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse commenting activity on others' ideas. The insight for management: There are challenges in maintaining an ongoing supply of high-quality ideas from the crowd over time.Effects of Piracy on Quality of Information Goods (p. 245) Atanu Lahiri, Debabrata Dey Worldwide losses caused by software piracy are estimated at approximately $59 billion. It is commonly believed that piracy of information goods leads to lower profits, which translate to lower incentives to invest in innovation and eventually to lower-quality products. Inadequate piracy enforcement efforts translate to lower investments in product development. The authors provide many practical examples that contradict this claim, such as HBO, which is raising the quality of their offerings precisely to fight a 30%\u201350% piracy rate. They test these anecdotes with rigorous analysis, and they unexpectedly find that, in certain situations, lower piracy enforcement increases the monopolist's incentive to invest in quality. The insight for management: Don't surrender to pirates; quality improvements may be a way to thwart their efforts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1687","","MS","Multidisciplinary","7","['diversity', 'affirmative action', 'gender quota', 'representation', 'social impact']","The article discusses affirmative action and its impact on gender representation in competitive environments, emphasizing the social benefits of diversity and inclusion.

Our model builds on work in the Carnegie tradition and in the group and behavioral decision-making literatures. We use the model to explore when delegation is preferable to other structures, such as voting and averaging. Our model shows that delegation is the most effective structure when there is diversity of expertise, when accurate delegation is possible, and when there is a good fit between the firm's knowledge and the knowledge required by the environment. Otherwise, depending on the knowledge breadth of the firm, voting or averaging may be the most effective structure.

We study individuals' decisions to avoid monitoring or regulation and thus enhance their ability to engage in unethical conduct. We conduct a laboratory experiment in which participants engage in a competitive task and can decide between having the opportunity to misreport their performance or having their performance verified by an external monitor. To study the effect of social factors on the willingness to be subject to monitoring, we vary whether participants make this decision simultaneously with others or sequentially, as well as whether the decision is private or public. Our results show that the opportunity to avoid being submitted to regulation produces more unethical conduct than situations in which regulation is either exogenously imposed or entirely absent.

A Direct Test with Contemporaneous Searches","Although it is intuitively plausible that a job seeker benefits by using contacts in her job search, the literature is plagued by theoretical disagreements and inconclusive empirical evidence. Single-firm studies consistently find that job seekers applying through referrals achieve better labor-market outcomes than job seekers applying without referrals, but the evidence from job-seeker studies is mixed. To solve this puzzle, we clarify the distinction between having social capital and using contacts as a search method. We present theoretical reasons to suggest that the lack of an association between a job seeker's social capital and whether or not she uses social networks to search for a job should not be taken to imply that job seekers who use social networks to search for jobs do not benefit from using contacts. We exploit a strategic research setting, the school-to-work transition of 291 university graduates who engaged in 3,112 contemporaneous job searches, to show that although a job seeker's social capital may not affect whether or not she uses contacts to search for a job, using contacts as a job-search method does improve her job-search outcomes.

In this model, the spot rate follows the Taylor rule and government bonds at different maturities are priced by no arbitrage. We allow the coefficients of the Taylor rule and the dynamics of inflation and output gap to be regime dependent and estimate the model using government bond yields. We find that the Fed is proactive in controlling inflation in one regime and accommodative for growth in another. Moreover, proactive monetary policies are associated with more stable inflation and output gap and therefore could have contributed to the Great Moderation. Our analysis also highlights the importance of switching regimes for term structure modeling. Without the regimes, inflation and output can explain less than 50% of the variations of bond yields. With the regimes, the two variables can explain more than 80% of the variations of bond yields.

Csaszar, J. P. Eggers How does the method of decision making affect outcomes? The authors study four information aggregation structures commonly used by organizations to evaluate opportunities: individual decision making, delegation to experts, majority voting, and averaging of opinions. They investigate how the performance of each of these structures is contingent upon the breadth of knowledge within the firm and changes in the environment. They explore when delegation is preferable to other structures, such as voting and averaging. They show that that delegation is the most effective structure when there is diversity of expertise, when accurate delegation is possible, and when there is a good fit between the firm's knowledge and the knowledge required by the environment. Otherwise, depending on the knowledge breadth of the firm, voting or averaging may be the most effective structure. Finally, they use their model to shed light on which structures are more robust to radical environmental change and when crowd-based decision making may outperform delegation. The insight for management: How a decision should be made depends on critical attributes of the organization and problem type.No-Arbitrage Taylor Rules with Switching Regimes (p. 2278) Haitao Li, Tao Li, Cindy Yu Is the Federal Reserve pro-growth or anti-inflation?

The authors attempt to distill how hyperlinking affects the (a) incentives of content nodes to produce high-quality content versus to link to third-party content, (b) profits of the various stakeholders, (c) average quality of content that becomes available to consumers, and (d) impact of content aggregators. The insight for management: The link economy has both benefits and drawbacks for content creators and consumers.Tempus Fugit: Time Pressure in Risky Decisions (p. 2380) Martin G. Kocher, Julius Pahlke, Stefan T. Trautmann Does haste make waste? The authors study the effects of time pressure on risky decisions for pure gain opportunities, pure loss opportunities, and mixed opportunities involving both gains and losses. They find that time pressure has no effect on risk attitudes for gains but increases risk aversion for losses. For mixed opportunities, subjects become simultaneously more loss averse and more gain seeking under time pressure, depending on the framing of the opportunities. The results suggest the importance of aspiration levels, and thus the overall probability to break even, under time pressure. The insight for management: Time pressure creates risk aversion for decisions surrounding losses.Investors' Heterogeneity and Implied Volatility Smiles (p. 2392) Tao Li How is stock variability affected by differences among investors? Heterogeneity in beliefs and time preferences among investors make stock volatility stochastic, even though the volatility of the underlying dividend is constant. The Black\u2013Scholes implied volatility surface, which depends on wealth distribution, investors' beliefs, and time preferences, exhibits observed patterns that are widely documented in various options markets. The author tests a model against weekly S&P 500 index options from January 1996 to April 2006. The model shows comparable performance to the stochastic volatility and jump model and outperforms the traders' rules and two no-arbitrage models (stochastic volatility, and stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rate) in terms of out-of-sample pricing errors. The insight for management: New modeling approaches capture the effect of shareholder differences on the volatility of stock option prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1812","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['ethical behavior', 'regulation', 'unethical conduct']","The article discusses ethical behavior and the impact of regulation on unethical conduct, which aligns with moderate woke themes.

Evidence from UK Companies","This paper examines how different types of interactions with U.S. markets by non-U.S. firms are associated with higher levels of CEO pay, greater emphasis on incentive-based compensation, and smaller pay gaps with U.S. firms. Using a sample of CEOs of UK firms and using both broad cross-sectional and narrow event-window tests, we find that capital market relationship in the form of a U.S. exchange listing is related to higher UK CEO pay; however, the effect is similar when UK firms have a listing in any foreign country, implying a foreign listing effect not unique to the United States. Product market relationships measured by the extent of sales in the United States by UK companies are associated with higher pay, greater use of U.S.-style pay arrangements, and a reduction in the U.S.\u2013UK pay gap. The product market effect is incremental to the effect of a U.S. exchange listing, the extent of the firm's non-U.S. foreign market interactions, and the characteristics of the executive.

We hypothesize that one cause is that individuals are overconfident (in particular, overprecise) in their estimation of order variation. Previous work has shown theoretically that underestimating the variance of demand causes orders to deviate from optimal in predictable ways. We provide two experiments supporting this theoretical link. In the first, we elicit the precision of each individual's beliefs and demonstrate that overprecision significantly correlates with order bias. We find that overprecision explains almost one-third of the observed ordering mistakes and that the effect of overprecision is robust to learning and other dynamic considerations. In the second, we introduce a new technique to exogenously reduce overprecision. We find that participants randomly assigned to this treatment demonstrate less overprecision and less biased orders than do those in a control group.

Conventional wisdom attributes this segregation to the homophilous nature of contact networks, and leaves little role for organizational influences. Yet employee referrals are necessarily initiated within a firm by employee referrers subject to organizational policies. We build theory regarding the role of referrers in the segregating effects of network recruitment. Using mathematical and computational models, we investigate how empirically documented referrer behaviors affect job segregation. We show that referrer behaviors can segregate jobs beyond the effects of homophilous network recruitment. Furthermore, and contrary to past understandings, we show that referrer behaviors can also mitigate most, if not all, of the segregating effects of network recruitment.

However, in an important economic context\u2014401(k) pension plans\u2014we find that larger menus are objectively worse than smaller menus, as measured by the maximum Sharpe ratio achievable. We propose a model in which menu setters differ in their ability to preselect the menu. We show that when the cost of increasing the menu size is sufficiently small, a lower-ability menu setter optimally offers more items in the menu than a higher-ability menu setter. Nevertheless, the menu optimally offered by a higher-ability menu setter remains superior. This results in a negative relation between menu size and menu quality: smaller menus are better than larger menus.

Thus, the sensitivity measure will not vary by alternative specifications of the utility function over the output. To measure separation, we propose using either Kuiper's metric or Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov's metric.

Economic and Sociological Explanations","Four distinct theoretical programs have examined market entry decisions of multiunit firms, advancing different explanations for the relationship between a firm's likelihood of entry into a geographical market and the number of rivals that are already present in the target market. Within the strategy literature, theory of strategic interactions explains that firms will want to establish a foothold in markets where their multimarket competitors are scarce, but avoid markets where there are many multimarket competitors. Within economic geography, positive externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition explain their desire to avoid them. Within the ecological tradition, density dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and subsequently increased competition for resources there. Within new institutional theory, the presence of rivals is seen as a signal that a particular market is suitable for entry. Although generally quoted and mentioned in the literature, these four explanations have not been sufficiently separated to indicate whether these four mechanisms all operate simultaneously or whether one of them might account for the often found inverse-U-shaped relationship. Distinguishing firms with different strategies and using various moderators, we test the four explanations jointly and demonstrate their scope of operation.

Indeed, technologies such as digital video recorders have increased the ease with which disclosures can be avoided by consumers. Although such inattention may result in a consumer missing information from one or more competing firms, consumers who have missed disclosures might decide to search for quality information to become fully informed before making a purchase decision. In this paper we incorporate consumer attentiveness, as well as the related endogenous search decision, into a model of quality disclosure. Our results suggest that firms should disclose less quality information as the share of partially informed consumers (informed about one firm but not the other) increases, or as consumer search costs increase.

Evidence from UK Companies (p. 2413) Joseph J. Gerakos, Joseph D. Piotroski, Suraj Srinivasan How are different types of interactions with U.S. markets by non-U.S. firms associated with compensation of employees? The authors find that there are higher levels of CEO pay, greater emphasis on incentive-based compensation, and smaller pay gaps with U.S. firms in non-U.S. companies that interact with U.S. markets. Using a sample of CEOs of UK firms and using both broad cross-sectional and narrow event-window tests, they find that capital market relationship in the form of a U.S. exchange listing is related to higher UK CEO pay; however, the effect is similar when UK firms have a listing in any foreign country, implying that a foreign listing effect is not unique to the United States.

The U.S.\u2013UK CEO pay gap reduces in UK firms that make U.S. acquisitions. Furthermore, the firm's use of a U.S. compensation consultant increases the sensitivity of UK pay practices to U.S. product market relationships. The insight for management: Interactions with U.S. markets can drive foreign firms to U.S.-style compensation.Learning from My Success and from Others' Failure: Evidence from Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery (p. 2435) Diwas KC, Bradley R. Staats, Francesca Gino Do we learn from our successes or from our failures? Learning from past experience is central to an organization's adaptation and survival. A key dimension of prior experience is whether an outcome was successful or unsuccessful.

Price frames, or ways to present price information, are used regularly in retail to attract buyers. Frame choices affect the comparability of price offers and may cause consumer confusion and lower price sensitivity. The authors find that firms randomize their frame choices to obfuscate price comparisons and sustain positive profits. Furthermore, the authors suggest that an increase in the number of competitors induces firms to rely more on frame complexity. The insight for management: Where there is confusion, there is profit; confusing price frames reduces consumer price comparisons, which may boost industry profits and lower consumer surplus.Missing Links: Referrer Behavior and Job Segregation (p. 2470) Brian Rubineau, Roberto M. Fernandez How does referral recruitment contribute to job segregation? The importance of networks in labor markets is well known. Such networks create a job-segregating effect in organizations. The segregation is attributed to the homophilous nature of contact networks, the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. The authors investigate the role of referrers in the segregating effects of network recruitment. They show that referrer behaviors can segregate jobs beyond the effects of homophilous network recruitment. They also show that referrer behaviors can also mitigate most, if not all, of the segregating effects of network recruitment. The insight for management: Referrers can provide opportunities for organizations to influence the effects of network recruitment.Salesforce Compensation with Inventory Considerations (p. 2490) Tinglong Dai, Kinshuk Jerath How do inventory level decisions affect the effort levels of a salesforce? Ideally, the salesforce generates demand to match the inventory stocked because if demand is below inventory level, the firm incurs a cost for the leftover inventory, and if demand is above inventory level, the salesperson's effort is wasted. If the stock of inventory is insufficient, the salesforce is demotivated, and it is typically not possible to keep track of demand that was, or could have been, realized but was not fulfilled due to lack of inventory. The authors find that it may be optimal for the firm to stock more than the first-best inventory level, because this enables the firm to obtain a more precise indicator of the salesperson's effort. The possibility of stockouts due to limited inventory also leads to several counterintuitive results, including the following: (i) relative to when stockouts are not considered, it may be optimal for the firm to pay a higher bonus even though limited inventory constrains sales; (ii) as inventory becomes more expensive, thereby forcing the firm to lower its inventory, the firm may nevertheless pay the agent a higher bonus; and (iii) if there is a lower probability that the agent's effort exertion leads to high demand, rather than lowering inventory due to the lower sales potential, the firm may increase inventory. The insight for management: Inventory levels and salesforce compensation strategies interact.Overconfidence in Newsvendor Orders: An Experimental Study (p. 2502) Yufei Ren, Rachel Croson How can overconfidence adversely affect decision quality in supply chain and inventory settings? The authors test whether orders deviate from optimal when individuals are overconfident (in particular, overprecise) in their estimation of order variation. They find that overprecision explains almost one-third of the observed ordering mistakes and that the effect of overprecision is robust to learning and other dynamic considerations. They propose a new technique to exogenously reduce overprecision. They find that participants demonstrate less overprecision and less bias than those who don't use the proposed technique. The insight for management: Overconfidence creates errors in supply chain ordering and inventory management that can be remedied through new techniques.When Smaller Menus Are Better: Variability in Menu-Setting Ability (p. 2518) David Goldreich, Hanna Ha\u0142aburda Are large menus better than small menus? Recent literature argues that individuals' apparent preference for smaller menus can be explained by their behavioral biases or informational limitations. These explanations imply that absent behavioral or informational effects, larger menus would be objectively better. However, in an important economic context\u2014401(k) pension plans\u2014the authors find that larger menus are objectively worse than smaller menus, as measured by the maximum Sharpe ratio achievable. The authors propose a model in which menu setters differ in their ability to preselect the menu. We show that when the cost of increasing the menu size is sufficiently small, a lower-ability menu setter optimally offers more items in the menu than a higher-ability menu setter. Nevertheless, the menu optimally offered by a higher-ability menu setter remains superior. The insight for management: There is a negative relation between menu size and menu quality; smaller menus are better than larger menus.Invariant Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (p. 2536) Manel Baucells, Emanuele Borgonovo How does uncertainty affect investing decisions? In evaluating opportunities, investors wish to identify key sources of uncertainty. The authors propose a new way to measure how sensitive model outputs are to each probabilistic input (e.g., revenues, growth, idiosyncratic risk parameters). The authors propose a metric that robustly measures the sensitivity of decisions to such uncertainty. The insight for management: New approaches improve the ability to measure the sensitivity of decisions to uncertainty.Are Analysts' Forecasts Informative to the General Public? (p. 2550) Oya Alt\u0131k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, Vadim S. Balashov, Robert S. Hansen Contrary to the common view that analysts are important information agents, intraday returns evidence shows that announcements of analysts' forecast revisions release little new information, on average. Further cross-sectional evidence from returns around the announcements confirms that revisions are virtually information free. Daily announcement returns used in the literature appear to overstate the analyst's role as information agent, because forecast announcements are often issued directly after reports of significant news about the followed firm. The evidence reveals a sequential relationship between events and news and forecast revisions indicative of analyst piggybacking, not prophecy. The insight for management: Price reactions to analysts' reports reveal little new information.When the Tail Wags the Dog: Industry Leaders, Limited Attention, and Spurious Cross-Industry Information Diffusion (p. 2566) Ling Cen, Kalok Chan, Sudipto Dasgupta, Ning Gao How does industry diffusion affect stock returns? Within an industry, stock returns of larger firms lead those of smaller firms, suggesting an intraindustry information diffusion process. Most industry leaders, however, have business segments in other \u201cminor-segment\u201d industries, whereas most small firms are pure players operating in one industry only. If investors cannot filter out the irrelevant information from the leaders' minor segments, the pure players will be mispriced due to spurious cross-industry information diffusion. The authors document both a strong contemporaneous and a lead\u2013lag relation in stock returns between firms from industry leaders' minor-segment industries and pure players in the industry leaders' major-segment industry. The insight for management: Because of limited attention and information of investors, the market may misprice pure industry players and those that participate in multiple industries.How Does Rivals' Presence Affect Firms' Decision to Enter New Markets? Economic and Sociological Explanations (p. 2586) \u00d6zgecan Ko\u00e7ak, Serden \u00d6zcan Four distinct theoretical programs have examined market entry decisions of multiunit firms, advancing different explanations for the relationship between a firm's likelihood of entry into a geographical market and the number of rivals that are already present in the target market. Within the strategy literature, theory of strategic interactions explains that firms will want to establish a foothold in markets where their multimarket competitors are scarce but avoid markets where there are many multimarket competitors. Within economic geography, positive externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition explain their desire to avoid them. Within the ecological tradition, density dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and subsequently increased competition for resources there. Within new institutional theory, the presence of rivals is seen as a signal that a particular market is suitable for entry. The insight for management: Various explanations of market entry are reconciled, and their scope of operations is demonstrated.The Impact of Consumer Attentiveness and Search Costs on Firm Quality Disclosure: A Competitive Analysis (p. 2604) Bikram Ghosh, Michael R. Galbreth How do consumer attentiveness and search costs affect firm quality disclosure? Firms can invest to disclose quality information about their products to consumers, but consumers are not always perfectly attentive to these disclosures. Indeed, technologies such as digital video recorders have increased the ease with which disclosures can be avoided by consumers. Although such inattention may result in a consumer's missing information from one or more competing firms, consumers who have missed disclosures might decide to search for quality information to become fully informed before making a purchase decision. The authors incorporate consumer attentiveness, as well as the related endogenous search decision, into a model of quality disclosure. The insight for management: Firms should disclose less quality information as the share of partially informed consumers (informed about one firm but not the other) increases, or as consumer search costs increase.How Video Rental Patterns Change as Consumers Move Online (p. 2622) Alejandro Zentner, Michael Smith, Cuneyd Kaya How will consumption patterns for popular and \u201clong-tail\u201d products change when consumers move from brick-and-mortar to Internet markets? The authors address this question using customer-level panel data obtained from a national video rental chain as it was closing many of its local stores. These data allow the authors to use the closure of a consumer's local video store as an instrument, breaking the inherent endogeneity between channel choice and product choice. The results suggest that when consumers move from brick-and-mortar to online channels, they are significantly more likely to rent \u201cniche\u201d titles relative to \u201cblockbusters.\u201d The insight for management: A significant amount of niche product consumption online is due to the direct influence of the channel on consumer behavior, not just due to selection effects from the types of consumers who decide to use the Internet channel or the types of products that consumers decide to purchase online.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1850","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['CEO pay', 'job segregation', 'referrer behavior']","The article discusses topics like CEO pay and job segregation, but these are primarily framed within a technical and profit-focused context rather than emphasizing social justice or critical theory.

Hence, the authorities offer different kinds of incentives for people to become vaccinated such as subsidizing immunization or placing immunization centers in malls to make the process more accessible. We built a theoretical epidemiological game model to find the optimal incentive for vaccination and the corresponding expected level of vaccination coverage. The model was supported by survey data from questionnaires about people's perceptions about influenza and the vaccination against it. Results suggest that the optimal magnitude of the incentives should be greater when less contagious seasonal strains of influenza are involved and greater for the nonelderly population rather than the elderly, and should rise as high as $57 per vaccinated individual so that all children between the ages of six months and four years will be vaccinated.

This study analyzes how the performance of existing units is affected by the acquisition of another unit. The research focuses on three mechanisms: managerial distraction, resource transfer, and knowledge sharing. These mechanisms are studied in the context of existing units and acquired units with different levels of proximity and similarity between them. Using a detailed data set from an agribusiness company, empirical analysis shows that after an acquisition event there is a temporary decrease in the performance of existing units that are geographically proximate to the acquired unit. Data analysis also shows that after an acquisition event there is an increase in the performance of existing units that have similar characteristics to the acquired unit. In this latter case, the rate of increase in performance diminishes over time. This research demonstrates that the acquisition of an organizational unit can have differing dynamic effects on different parts of the organization.

We study how software development differences among producers (e.g., varying levels of process maturity) and software class and functionality differences (e.g., operating system versus productivity software) affect how these producers coordinate software release timing and pricing to optimally harness error reporting contributions from users. In settings where prices are fixed, we characterize the optimal release time and demonstrate why in some cases it can actually be preferable to delay release when customer error reporting rates increase. The manner in which a firm's optimal release time responds to increases in software functionality critically hinges on whether the added functionality enhances or dilutes user error reporting; in both cases, the effect of added functionality on release timing can go in either direction, depending on both firm and product market characteristics. For example, when processing costs are relatively large compared with goodwill costs, firms with lower process maturity will release earlier when per-module error reporting contributions become diluted and release later when these contributions become enhanced. We also examine how a firm adapts price with changes in error reporting levels and software functionality, and finally, we provide implications of how beta testing influences release timing.

We also conduct a series of counterfactual analyses that explore the effects of changes in service discipline on resulting waiting times and abandonment rates.

We attribute the variation in blog effects across markets to differences in demographic characteristics of markets combined with differences across demographic groups in their access and exposure to blogs as well as their responsiveness conditional on access. We study the effects of prerelease factors on opening day box office performance and of pre- and postrelease factors on box office performance one month after release. Our estimation accounts for confounding factors in the measurement of these effects via the use of instrumental variables. We find considerable heterogeneity in the effects across consumer- and firm-generated media and across geographic markets, with gender, income, race, and age driving across-market differences. Release day performance is impacted most by prerelease blog volume and advertising, whereas postrelease performance is influenced by postrelease blog valence and advertising. Across markets, there is more variance in advertising and blog valence (postrelease) elasticities than there is in blog volume (prerelease) elasticities. We identify the top 20 markets in terms of their elasticities to each of these three instruments. Further, we classify markets in terms of their sensitivities across these three instruments to identify the most sensitive markets that studios can target with their limited release strategies. Finally, we characterize the extent to which studios could have improved their limited release strategies by identifying the overlap between the actual release markets and the most responsive ones. We find that at the time of first-release studios cover only 53% of the most responsive advertising markets and 44% of the most responsive markets to prerelease blog volume in their limited release strategies, implying considerable room for improvement if these were the only metrics to assess those strategies.

Hence, the followers of these innovations face an important decision to make: they must choose to improve the new technology either on the key performance dimension shared with the old technology or on the new performance dimension. This paper investigates which path firms should choose when they face such a dilemma in the absence of any cost or capability issues. In doing so, we integrate customer response into the theory of technological evolution and allow preferences on the product choices to be context dependent. We show that context-dependent preferences may encourage the follower to improve the new technology on the new performance dimension. Later, we extend our game to a dynamic one and show that the context-dependent preferences may cause the pioneer to innovate less. This paper was accepted by J.

In recent literature, a similar margin-based argument is made by Klein and Wright (2007), whereas intense downstream retail competition coupled with high upstream margin causes upstream manufacturers to offer slotting fees for promotional shelf space. In this paper, we generalize this argument and show that it is possible to have the margin-based argument without any downstream retail competition and competition between products within a retail chain. Interestingly we show that slotting fees will be larger if the products sold by a retailer are complements rather than substitutes. Using a model of a channel bargaining game, we also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of slotting fees and show that for contracts with slotting fees under full vertical coordination, upstream marginal cost functions need to be increasing.

Often, as with microprocessors, the outputs differ in quality in the vertical sense and firms classify the output into different grades (products). We analyze product line design and production for a firm operating a vertical coproduct technology. We examine how the product line and profit are influenced by the production cost and output distribution of the technology. We prove that production cost influences product line design in a fundamentally different manner for coproduct technologies than for uniproduct technologies where the firm can produce products independently. For example, with coproducts, the size and length of the product line can both increase in the production cost. Contrary to the oft-held view that variability is bad, we prove the firm benefits from a more variable output distribution if the production or classification cost is low enough.

A firm can adopt either a sequential mechanism where the firm discloses to second-period arrivals the number of sign-ups accumulated in the first period, or a simultaneous mechanism where the firm does not post the number of first-period sign-ups and hence each cohort of consumers faces uncertainty about another cohort's size and valuations when making sign-up decisions. Our analysis shows that, compared with the simultaneous mechanism, the sequential mechanism leads to higher deal success rates and larger expected consumer surpluses. This result holds for a multiperiod extension and when the firm offers a price discount schedule with multiple breakpoints.

We develop a behavioral economics model that shows that if contestants are averse to being responsible for the team's loss, a team-based (TB) contest can yield higher effort than an individual-based (IB) contest. This prediction is contrary to those of standard economics models, which favor IB contests over TB contests. We test the competing predictions using laboratory economics experiments. The results show that when contestants do not know each other, average effort levels in the TB and IB contests are not different. When contestants are allowed to socialize with potential teammates before making effort decisions, TB contests yield higher effort relative to IB contests.

While contracts are typically seen as either morally binding promises or morally neutral business instruments, the data presented here show that contracts of individuals are associated more strongly with promises than are contracts of organizations.

Models of decision making aim to predict decisions across a wide range of possible stimuli, but practical limitations force experimenters to select only a handful of them for actual testing. Some stimuli are more diagnostic between models than others, so the choice of stimuli is critical. This paper provides the theoretical background and a methodological framework for adaptive selection of optimal stimuli for discriminating among models of risky choice. The approach, called adaptive design optimization, adapts the stimulus in each experimental trial based on the results of the preceding trials. We demonstrate the validity of the approach with simulation studies aiming to discriminate expected utility, weighted expected utility, original prospect theory, and cumulative prospect theory models.

The effectiveness of QMC methods crucially depends on the discontinuity and the dimension of the problem. This paper shows how the two fundamental limitations can be overcome in some cases. We first study how path-generation methods (PGMs) affect the structure of the discontinuities and what the effect of discontinuities is on the accuracy of QMC methods. The insight is that the discontinuities can be QMC friendly (i.e., aligned with the coordinate axes) or not, depending on the PGM. The PGMs that offer the best performance in QMC methods are those that make the discontinuities QMC friendly. The structure of discontinuities can affect the accuracy of QMC methods more significantly than the effective dimension. This insight motivates us to propose a novel way of handling the discontinuities. The basic idea is to align the discontinuities with the coordinate axes by a judicious design of a method for simulating the underlying processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to dramatic variance reduction in QMC methods for pricing options and for estimating Greeks. It also reduces the effective dimension of the problem.

The preference for variety is a consequence of diminishing marginal utility for repeated experiences with the same product. We find consumer variety seeking can either soften or intensify price competition, depending on the difference in firm qualities and the strength of consumer preference for variety. When the qualities are similar (or the consumer preference for variety is strong), prices and profits are higher than would be obtained in the absence of variety seeking. On the other hand, if qualities differ enough (or the preference for variety is weak), stronger preferences for variety are associated with more intense price competition and lower profits. When firms set their qualities before competing on price and the range of feasible qualities is restricted such that variety seeking softens competition, competing firms choose to minimally differentiate themselves from each other. The preference for variety can drive the firms to offer multiunit discounts, and the greater price flexibility from these discounts does not necessarily reduce profits relative to simple unit pricing.

Building on human capital theory, this study provides theoretical explanations for the effects of experience at a start-up on earnings across an individual's career and then examines these implications in the context of California's semiconductor industry. Comparing the career trajectories of employees who join start-ups with a matched control group of comparable workers without start-up experience, I perform a counterfactual analysis and find that start-up experience in this context has a persistent positive effect on earnings that extend outside the entrepreneurial environment.

Firms hire their executives using optimal contracts derived within a competitive labour market. To motivate effort, firms must use some variable remuneration. Such remuneration introduces a myopia problem: an executive would wish to inflate early expected earnings at some risk to future profits. To manage this short-termism, some bonus pay is deferred. Convergence in size among firms makes the cost of managing the myopia problem grow faster than the cost of managing the effort problem. Eventually, the optimal contract jumps from one deterring myopia to one tolerating myopia. Under some conditions, the industry partitions: the largest firms hire executives on contracts tolerant of myopia; smaller firms ensure myopia is ruled out.

This paper introduces a new risk tool to communicate the risk of investment products, and it examines how different risk-presentation modes influence risk-taking behavior and investors' recall ability of the risk-return profile of financial products. We analyze four different ways of communicating risk: (i) numerical descriptions, (ii) experience sampling, (iii) graphical displays, and (iv) a combination of these formats in the \u201crisk tool.\u201d Participants receive information about a risky and a risk-free fund and make an allocation between the two in an experimental investment portfolio. We find that risky allocations are elevated in both the risk tool and experience sampling conditions. Greater risky allocations in the risk tool condition are associated with decreased risk perception, increased confidence in the risky fund, and a lower estimation of the probability of a loss. In addition to these favorable perceptions of the risky fund, participants in the risk tool condition are more accurate on recall questions regarding the expected return and the probability of a loss. We find no evidence of greater dissatisfaction with returns in these conditions, and we observe a willingness to take on similar levels of risk in subsequent allocations.

We show that such individuals can lead to an aggregate economy that is risk averse. The converse is also true. An aggregate economy that exhibits risk aversion does not imply an economy of individual risk averters. An economy demanding a risk premium can be formed from individuals who do not demand such compensation.

Real-world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the \u201cright\u201d model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a \u201cgeneric\u201d model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward \u201cautomating\u201d the crucial task of choice model selection.

One possible explanation is that they turn to services to generate additional profits when their product industries mature and product revenues and profits decline. We explore this assumption by examining the role of services in the financial performance of firms in the prepackaged software products industry (Standard Industrial Classification code 7372) from 1990 to 2006. We find a convex, nonlinear relationship between a product firm's fraction of total sales coming from services and its overall operating margins. As expected, firms with a very high level of product sales are most profitable, and rising services are associated with declining profitability. We find, however, that additional services start to have a positive marginal effect on the firm's overall profits when services reach a majority of a product firm's sales. We show that traditional industry maturity arguments cannot fully explain our data. It is likely that changes in both strategy and the business environment lead product firms to place more emphasis on services.

Keeping the net profit structure constant, we examine three payment schemes that can be interpreted as the newsvendor's order being financed by the newsvendor herself (scheme O), by the supplier through delayed order payment (scheme S), and by the customer through advanced revenue (scheme C). In a laboratory study, we find that inventory quantities exhibit a consistent decreasing pattern in the order of schemes O, S, and C, with the order quantities of scheme S being close to the expected-profit-maximizing solution. These observations are inconsistent with the expected-profit-maximizing model, contradict what a regular or hyperbolic time-discounting model would predict, and cannot be explained by the loss aversion model. Instead, they are consistent with a model that underweights the order-time payments, which can be explained by the \u201cprospective accounting\u201d theory in the mental accounting literature. A second study shows that the results hold even if all physical payments are conducted at the same time, suggesting that the framing of the payment scheme is sufficient to induce the prospective accounting behavior. We further validate the robustness of our model under different profit conditions. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes involved in newsvendor decisions and have implications for supply chain financing and contract design.

Patent Citations as a Measure of Knowledge Flows from Public Research","This paper assesses the validity and accuracy of firms' backward patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows from public research by employing a newly constructed data set that matches patents to survey data at the level of the research and development lab. Using survey-based measures of the dimensions of knowledge flows, we identify sources of systematic measurement error associated with backward citations to both patent and nonpatent references. We find that patent citations reflect the codified knowledge flows from public research, but they appear to miss knowledge flows that are more private and contract based in nature, as well as those used in firm basic research. We also find that firms' patenting and citing strategies affect patent citations, making citations less indicative of knowledge flows. In addition, an illustrative analysis examining the magnitude and direction of measurement error bias suggests that measuring knowledge flows with patent citations can lead to substantial underestimation of the effect of public research on firms' innovative performance. Throughout our analyses we find that nonpatent references (e.g., journals, conferences, etc.), not the more commonly used patent references, are a better measure of knowledge originating from public research.

In the classic example of the \u201ccentipede game,\u201d however, players frequently violate this principle. An alternative is a \u201cdynamic level-k\u201d model, where players choose a rule from a rule hierarchy. The rule hierarchy is iteratively defined such that the level-k rule is a best response to the level-(k-1) rule, and the level-\u221e rule corresponds to backward induction. Players choose rules based on their best guesses of others' rules and use historical plays to improve their guesses. The model captures two systematic violations of backward induction in centipede games, limited induction and repetition unraveling. Because the dynamic level-k model always converges to backward induction over repetition, the former can be considered to be a tracing procedure for the latter. We also examine the generalizability of the dynamic level-k model by applying it to explain systematic violations of backward induction in sequential bargaining games. We show that the same model is capable of capturing these violations in two separate bargaining experiments.

The authors introduce a new risk tool to communicate the risk of investment products, and they examine how different risk-presentation modes influence risk-taking behavior and investors' recall ability of the risk-return profile of financial products. They analyze four different ways of communicating risk: (i) numerical descriptions, (ii) experience sampling, (iii) graphical displays, and (iv) a combination of these formats in the \u201crisk tool.\u201d Participants receive information about a risky fund and a risk-free fund and make an allocation between the two in an experimental investment portfolio. Greater risky allocations in the risk tool condition are associated with decreased risk perception, increased confidence in the risky fund, and a lower estimation of the probability of a loss. In addition to these favorable perceptions of the risky fund, participants in the risk tool condition are more accurate on recall questions regarding the expected return and the probability of a loss. The insight for management: Presenting fund performance graphically changes the perception of the desirability of the investment.Robust Solutions of Optimization Problems Affected by Uncertain Probabilities (p. 341) Aharon Ben-Tal, Dick den Hertog, Anja De Waegenaere, Bertrand Melenberg, Gijs Rennen What methodological approach is most appropriate in problems in inventory control or finance that involve terms containing moments of random variables such as expected utility? The authors suggest a robust optimization methodology that extends the results to problems that are nonlinear in the optimization variables. The insight for management: An advanced methodology has been developed that can be used in several applications, including an asset pricing example and a numerical multi-item newsvendor example.Optimal Decision Stimuli for Risky Choice Experiments: An Adaptive Approach (p. 358) Daniel R. Cavagnaro, Richard Gonzalez, Jay I. Myung, Mark A. Pitt How are stimuli selected for discriminating among models of risky choice? The authors propose an approach, called adaptive design optimization, that adapts the stimulus in each experimental trial based on the results of the preceding trials. Collecting data to discriminate between models of risky choice requires careful selection of decision stimuli. Models of decision making aim to predict decisions across a wide range of possible stimuli, but practical limitations force experimenters to select only a handful of them for actual testing. The insight for management: A new approach for adaptively selecting stimuli for problems of expected utility, weighted expected utility, original prospect theory, and cumulative prospect theory has been developed.Pricing and Hedging with Discontinuous Functions: Quasi\u2013Monte Carlo Methods and Dimension Reduction (p. 376) Xiaoqun Wang, Ken Seng Tan What modeling approach can be used for pricing and hedging of complex financial instruments? Quasi\u2013Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are important numerical tools in the pricing and hedging of complex financial instruments. The effectiveness of QMC methods crucially depends on the discontinuity and the dimension of the problem. The authors show how the two fundamental limitations can be overcome in some cases. They first study how path-generation methods (PGMs) affect the structure of the discontinuities and what the effect of discontinuities is on the accuracy of QMC methods. The insight is that the discontinuities can be QMC friendly (i.e., aligned with the coordinate axes) or not, depending on the PGM. The PGMs that offer the best performance in QMC methods are those that make the discontinuities QMC friendly. The structure of discontinuities can affect the accuracy of QMC methods more significantly than the effective dimension. This insight motivates the authors to propose a novel way of handling the discontinuities. The basic idea is to align the discontinuities with the coordinate axes by a judicious design of a method for simulating the underlying processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to dramatic variance reduction in QMC methods for pricing options. The insight for management: Advances in quasi\u2013Monte Carlo methods can reduce variance in pricing options.Vertical Differentiation with Variety-Seeking Consumers (p. 390) Robert Zeithammer, Raphael Thomadsen How should prices and quality levels be set when customers desire variety? The preference for variety is a consequence of diminishing marginal utility for repeated experiences with the same product. The authors find that consumer variety seeking can either soften or intensify price competition, depending on the difference in firm qualities and the strength of consumer preference for variety. When the qualities are similar (or the consumer preference for variety is strong), prices and profits are higher than would be obtained in the absence of variety seeking. On the other hand, if qualities differ enough (or the preference for variety is weak), stronger preferences for variety are associated with more intense price competition and lower profits. When firms set their qualities before competing on price and the range of feasible qualities is restricted such that variety seeking softens competition, competing firms choose to minimally differentiate themselves from each other. The insight for management: The preference for variety can drive the firms to offer multiunit discounts, and the greater price flexibility from these discounts does not necessarily reduce profits relative to simple unit pricing.Industry Structure, Executive Pay, and Short-Termism (p. 402) John Thanassoulis How should executive contracts be structured to avoid short-termism behavior that can cause excessively risky behavior? The author outlines a new theory linking industry structure to optimal employment contracts and executive short-termism. Firms hire their executives using optimal contracts derived within a competitive labor market. To motivate effort, firms must use some variable remuneration. Such remuneration introduces a myopia problem: An executive would wish to inflate early expected earnings at some risk to future profits. To manage this short-termism, some bonus pay is deferred. Eventually, the optimal contract jumps from one deterring myopia to one tolerating myopia. The insight for management: Modeling helps structure executive pay to balance short-termism yet still create incentives for performance.Services and the Business Models of Product Firms: An Empirical Analysis of the Software Industry (p. 420) Fernando F. Suarez, Michael A. Cusumano, Steven J. Kahl Many technology product providers such as SAP and Oracle increasingly rely on service revenues as part of their business models. Is this shift good or bad for these companies? One possible explanation is that they turn to services to generate additional profits when their product industries mature and product revenues and profits decline. The authors explore this assumption by examining the role of services in the financial performance of firms in the prepackaged software products industry from 1990 to 2006. They find a convex, nonlinear relationship between a product firm's fraction of total sales coming from services and its overall operating margins. As expected, firms with a very high level of product sales are most profitable, and rising services are associated with declining profitability. They find, however, that additional services start to have a positive marginal effect on the firm's overall profits when services reach a majority of a product firm's sales. It is likely that changes in both strategy and the business environment lead product firms to place more emphasis on services. The insight for management: Beyond 56% of total revenues, additional service revenues can be detrimental to total profitability.The Effect of Payment Schemes on Inventory Decisions: The Role of Mental Accounting (p. 436) Li Chen, A. G\u00fcrhan K\u00f6k, Jordan D. Tong Does the payment scheme have an effect on inventory decisions in the newsvendor problem? The authors examine three payment schemes that can be interpreted as the newsvendor's order being financed by the newsvendor herself (scheme O), by the supplier through delayed order payment (scheme S), and by the customer through advanced revenue (scheme C). The authors find that inventory quantities exhibit a consistent decreasing pattern in the order of schemes O, S, and C, with the order quantities of scheme S being close to the expected-profit-maximizing solution. These observations are inconsistent with the expected-profit-maximizing model, contradict what a regular or hyperbolic time-discounting model would predict, and cannot be explained by the loss aversion model. Instead, they are consistent with a model that underweights the order-time payments, which can be explained by the \u201cprospective accounting\u201d theory in the mental accounting literature. A second study shows that the results hold even if all physical payments are conducted at the same time, suggesting that the framing of the payment scheme is sufficient to induce the prospective accounting behavior. The authors further validate the robustness of their model under different profit conditions. The insight for management: Modeling approaches contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes involved in newsvendor decisions and have implications for supply chain financing and contract design.A Dynamic Level-k Model in Sequential Games (p. 452) Teck-Hua Ho, Xuanming Su In sequential games, one can use \u201cbackward induction\u201d to predict future behavior. In the classic example of the \u201ccentipede game,\u201d however, players frequently violate this principle. An alternative is a \u201cdynamic level-k\u201d model, where players choose a rule from a rule hierarchy. Players choose rules based on their best guesses of others' rules and use historical plays to improve their guesses. The model captures two systematic violations of backward induction in centipede games, limited induction and repetition unraveling. Because the dynamic level-k model always converges to backward induction over repetition, the former can be considered to be a tracing procedure for the latter. The authors also examine the generalizability of the dynamic level-k model by applying it to explain systematic violations of backward induction in sequential bargaining games. The insight for management: A new modeling approach resolves prior violations in backward induction.Individual vs. Aggregate Preferences: The Case of a Small Fish in a Big Pond (p. 470) Douglas W. Blackburn, Andrey D. Ukhov Aggregate preferences determine the price of risk, yet individual biases characterize deviations from rational financial models. How does aggregation affect financial market performance? The authors study the relationship between the risk preferences of individuals and the risk preferences of the aggregate economy. To emphasize the vast differences that can occur between individual and market preferences brought about through aggregation, the authors assume an economy consisting entirely of risk seekers. They show that such individuals can lead to an aggregate economy that is risk averse. The converse is also true. An aggregate economy that exhibits risk aversion does not imply an economy of individual risk averters. An economy demanding a risk premium can be formed from individuals who do not demand such compensation. The insight for management: Understanding the relationship between the preferences of individuals and the preferences of the aggregate economy is crucial for understanding the connection between the behavioral finance literature, which focuses on individual preferences, and the asset-pricing literature, which focuses on aggregate prices.Solving Constrained Consumption\u2013Investment Problems by Simulation of Artificial Market Strategies (p. 485) Bj\u00f6rn Bick, Holger Kraft, Claus Munk How can consumption and investment strategy problems be solved efficiently? Utility-maximizing consumption and investment strategies in closed form are unknown for realistic settings involving portfolio constraints, incomplete markets, and potentially a high number of state variables. Standard numerical methods are hard to implement in such cases. The authors propose a numerical procedure that combines the abstract idea of artificial, unconstrained complete markets, well-known closed-form solutions in affine or quadratic return models, straightforward Monte Carlo simulation, and a standard iterative optimization routine. The method provides an upper bound on the wealth-equivalent loss compared to the unknown optimal strategy, and it facilitates our understanding of the economic forces at play by building on closed-form expressions for the strategies considered. The insight for management: New approaches to solving consumption investment problems to near optimality allow for more efficient solution times.Lens or Prism? Patent Citations as a Measure of Knowledge Flows from Public Research (p. 504) Michael Roach, Wesley M. Cohen What constitutes knowledge flow? The authors assess the validity and accuracy of firms' backward patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows from public research by employing a newly constructed data set that matches patents to survey data at the level of the research and development lab. The authors identify sources of systematic measurement error associated with backward citations to both patent and nonpatent references. They find that patent citations reflect the codified knowledge flows from public research, but they appear to miss knowledge flows that are more private and contract based in nature, as well as those used in firm basic research. They also find that firms' patenting and citing strategies affect patent citations, making citations less indicative of knowledge flows. In addition, an illustrative analysis examining the magnitude and direction of measurement error bias suggests that measuring knowledge flows with patent citations can lead to substantial underestimation of the effect of public research on firms' innovative performance. The insight for management: Nonpatent references (e.g., journals, conferences, etc.), not the more commonly used patent references, are a better measure of knowledge originating from public research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1707","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['trust', 'reputation', 'feedback', 'management', 'efficiency']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of managing trust and reputation in online marketplaces, with no significant emphasis on socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

We propose a tractable and flexible portfolio choice model where market crashes can trigger switching into another regime with a different investment opportunity set. We characterize the optimal trading strategy in terms of coupled integro-differential equations and develop a quite general iterative numerical solution procedure. We conduct an extensive analysis of the optimal trading strategy. In contrast to standard portfolio choice models, changes in the investment opportunity set in one regime can affect the optimal trading strategy in another regime even in the absence of transaction costs. In addition, an increase in the expected jump size can increase stock investment even when the expected return remains the same and the volatility increases. Moreover, we show that misestimating the correlation between market crashes and market illiquidity can be costly to investors.

We contrast single-unit treatments with multiple-unit treatments in which participants encounter several units of a good (e.g., five chocolates). We observe endowment effects of typical magnitude for singleton holdings but attenuated endowment effects for multiple-unit holdings. Moreover, endowment effects consistently arise for singletons even as the definition of a unit is altered. For instance, participants holding one piece of chocolate show an endowment effect of standard size, but so do participants holding one box of chocolates. Yet the box contains about 20 individual pieces of chocolate, and participants given that many separate pieces show a substantially attenuated endowment effect. We thus propose the property of \u201cunit dependence\u201d: the definition of a unit can change, but contingent on any given definition, a pronounced endowment effect may emerge for singletons but not multiples.

Because the unreviewed movies tend to be below average in quality, this practice provides a useful setting in which to test models of limited strategic thinking: Do moviegoers seem to realize that no review is a sign of low quality? A companion paper showed that in a set of all widely released movies in 2000\u20132009, cold opening produces a significant 20%\u201330% increase in domestic box office revenue, which is consistent with moviegoers overestimating quality of unreviewed movies (perhaps due to limited strategic thinking). This paper reviews those findings and provides two models to analyze this data: an equilibrium model and a behavioral cognitive hierarchy model that allows for differing levels of strategic thinking between moviegoers and movie studios. The behavioral model fits the data better, because moviegoer parameters are relatively close to those observed in experimental subjects. These results suggests that limited strategic thinking rather than equilibrium reasoning may be a better explanation for na\u00efve moviegoer behavior.

Previous research has shown that outsourcing of back-office IS generally has a positive effect on shareholder value of the outsourcing firm. Much less is known about the performance implications of outsourcing of another important IS function, namely, front-office customer relationship management (CRM) systems, where the vendor uses its own personnel and software to perform several CRM tasks. Previous, largely anecdotal evidence shows that the performance implications of outsourcing CRM range from very negative to very positive. To address this unsatisfactory state of knowledge, we provide and empirically test a contingency perspective on the performance implications of outsourcing CRM processes. We do so using the event-study methodology. The results are largely consistent with our contingency model. CRM outsourcing is more beneficial to firms that are high on information technology capabilities and low on marketing capabilities, and less beneficial when it concerns presales CRM. Similarly, although vendor economic distance has a positive influence on the outsourcing firm's shareholder value, vendor cultural distance has a negative influence. These effects are in turn significantly moderated by the type of CRM process outsourced.

Typically these parameters are elicited by presenting decision makers with a series of static choices between alternatives, gambles, or delayed payments. The proposed method dynamically (i.e., adaptively) designs such choices to optimize the information provided by each choice, while leveraging the distribution of the parameters across decision makers (heterogeneity) and capturing response error. We explore the convergence and the validity of our approach using simulations. The simulations suggest that the proposed method recovers true parameter values well under various circumstances. We then use an online experiment to compare our approach to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task completion time. We assess predictive accuracy in an out-of-sample task and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, our results indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while taking respondents about the same time to complete. For time preferences, both methods predict out-of-sample preferences equally well, while the proposed method takes significantly less completion time. For risk and time preferences, average completion time for our approach is approximately three minutes. Finally, we briefly review three applications that used the proposed methodology with various populations, and we discuss the potential benefits of the proposed methodology for research and practice.

We examine whether human capital investments directed toward employee training are effective in improving employee performance. Our rich employee level panel data set affords us the opportunity to link formal training with performance at the individual employee level. Using a dynamic panel model, we identify a significant positive impact of training on employee performance. A unit increase in training is linked to a 2.14% increase in an employee's performance. Interestingly, we find that in the IT sector, skills atrophy and consequently high-experience employees reap higher returns from training, which highlights the uniquely dynamic nature of IT knowledge and skills. We also find that general training that an employee can utilize outside the focal firm improves employee performance. However, specific training pertinent to the focal firm is not positively linked to performance. On the other hand, although domain and technical training both enhance employee performance individually, the interaction between the two suggests a substitutive relationship. Thus, our findings suggest that the value of training is conditional on a focused curricular approach that emphasizes a structured competency development program. Our findings have both theoretical and practical significance.

Offering a subsystem that performs many end-product functions has a dual effect on the provider's profits.

In extreme cases where managers cannot be incented contractually, private ownership is thought to be the primary organizational substitute. In this paper we explore geographic clustering as an alternative strategy for controlling managerial agency costs within the chain form of organization. Clustering may facilitate scale efficiencies in both monitoring and supervision, resulting in reduced agency costs and improved application of the chain's business model. We test this hypothesis in the nursing home industry, which is characterized by managerial contract costs resulting from multitask models of production. We find that clustered nursing homes achieve higher quality, conditional on labor inputs and patient characteristics. The clustering effect is concentrated on reductions in minor/potential harm violations, which are difficult to observe without close monitoring. Several proxies for local organizational experience (\u201clocal learning\u201d) cannot account for our findings, which are robust to a variety of alternative clustering definitions and competing explanations based on gaming behavior.

Many important managerial decisions occur in censored environments, such as inventory, risk taking, and employee evaluation decisions. In this research, we demonstrate a censorship bias\u2014individuals tend to rely too heavily on the observed censored sample, biasing their belief about the underlying population. We further show that the censorship bias is exacerbated for higher degrees of censorship, higher variance in the population, and higher variability in the censorship points. In four studies, we find evidence of the censorship bias across the domains of demand estimation and sequential risk taking. The bias causes individuals to make costly decisions and behave in an overly risk-averse manner.

We consider a supplier who offers a revenue-sharing contract to two competing retailers, one of whom has private information about uncertain market potential and orders first. This order information may be leaked to the uninformed retailer by the supplier to realize higher profits. We show that the incentives of the supplier and retailers are better aligned under a revenue-sharing contract, as opposed to under a wholesale-price contract, reducing the supplier's incentive to leak. This is true for a wide range of wholesale prices and revenue-share percentages and is more likely when the revenue-share percentage is higher and when variation in demand is greater. Preventing information leakage may result in higher profits not only for the informed retailer and supplier but surprisingly even for the uninformed retailer. Our results are robust when the model is generalized along various dimensions.

A customer's order quantity is positively correlated with past fill rates. Customers differ from one another in their contribution margins, their sensitivities to the past, and in their demand volatilities. By analyzing and comparing policies that ignore goodwill with ones that account for it, we investigate when and how customer memory effects impact supplier profits. We develop an approximate dynamic programming policy that dynamically rationalizes the fill rates the firm provides to each customer. This policy achieves higher rewards than margin-greedy and Lagrangian policies and yields insights into how a supplier can effectively manage customer memories to its advantage.

The authors study the performance of U.S. firms initiating same-sex domestic partnership benefit (SSDPB) policies. The results show that holding these firms upon their SSDPB initiation in a calendar portfolio earns a four-factor annualized excess return (alpha) of approximately 10% over the 1995\u20132008 sample period, beating 95% of all professional mutual funds in the United States. The insight for management: SSDPB adopters also show significant improvement in operating performance relative to nonadopters.Multiple-Unit Holdings Yield Attenuated Endowment Effects (p. 545) Katherine Burson, David Faro, Yuval Rottenstreich In terms of the psychology of wealth, is one piece of chocolate different from a box of chocolates? The \u201cendowment effect\u201d is a bias toward keeping rather than parting with one's possessions. Previous research on endowment focuses on a single unit of a good (e.g., one chocolate). The authors contrast single-unit treatments with multiple-unit treatments in which participants encounter several units of a good (e.g., five chocolates). They find that people treat a box of chocolates much like a single chocolate; in either case, there is a single-unit endowment, regardless of the definition of a unit. Participants holding one piece of chocolate show an endowment effect of standard size, but so do participants holding one box of chocolates. Yet the box contains about 20 individual pieces of chocolate, and participants given that many separate pieces show a substantially attenuated endowment effect. The insight for management: When it comes to endowments, people are subject to \u201cunit dependence\u201d; the definition of a unit can be a chocolate or a box, but a pronounced endowment effect may emerge for singletons but not multiples.Revenue Sharing and Information Leakage in a Supply Chain (p. 556) Guangwen Kong, Sampath Rajagopalan, Hao Zhang How can supply chain partners share more information to realize improved efficiency with less fear of information leakage? Advances in information technology have had a dramatic impact on the ability of firms in a supply chain to share information, and numerous firms have taken advantage of these advances. Greater collaboration between firms in a supply chain has resulted in initiatives such as Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR), in which well-known manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble and Black & Decker as well as major retailers such as Home Depot and Walmart have participated. But a major challenge has been the reluctance of some firms to share information vertically with suppliers because of the fear of leakage of this information to their competitors. The authors show that traditional wholesale pricing contracts are less effective than revenue-sharing contracts to facilitate information sharing in a supply chain and mitigate the negative effects of information leakage. The insight for management: The ideal of information sharing is more easily achieved if revenue-sharing contracts provide the appropriate incentives for cooperation.Biased Judgment in Censored Environments (p. 573) Daniel C. Feiler, Jordan D. Tong, Richard P. Larrick If a business sells out of inventory, can it know potential demand? If an employee completes a task, could they have done more? If a piece of equipment is replaced, how much longer could it have lasted? Each of these cases is a censored environment where a constraint, the censorship point, systematically distorts the observed sample because the environment constrains the information that managers can observe. The authors demonstrate a censorship bias\u2014individuals tend to rely too heavily on the observed censored sample, biasing their belief about the underlying population. The authors find that the censorship bias is exacerbated for higher degrees of censorship, higher variance in the population, and higher variability in the censorship points. The insight for management: Censorship bias causes individuals to make costly decisions and behave in an overly risk-averse manner.Dynamic Capacity Allocation to Customers Who Remember Past Service (p. 592) Daniel Adelman, Adam J. Mersereau How should a business ration among its customers in times of shortage? Whenever a firm doing business with a handful of customers (or customer segments) faces more demand than it can supply, it faces a tough choice. On one hand, there is a short-term opportunity for profit taking, by supplying only the most profitable customers today. On the other hand, this is potentially damaging to the firm's relationships with less profitable customers, who receive poor service today. When market conditions change in the future, these neglected customers could be essential to maintaining profitability, but their goodwill toward the firm may be so diminished that their business will not materialize when it is needed most. Customers remember when they were shorted; a customer's order quantity is positively correlated with past fill rates. The insight for management: Optimal rationing among customers depends on their unique contribution margins, their sensitivities to the past, and their demand volatilities.Dynamic Experiments for Estimating Preferences: An Adaptive Method of Eliciting Time and Risk Parameters (p. 613) Olivier Toubia, Eric Johnson, Theodoros Evgeniou, Philippe Delqui\u00e9 When trying to understand an individual's choices it would be helpful to know the decision maker's underlying preferences. How can those preferences be determined? The authors present a method that dynamically designs elicitation questions for estimating risk and time preference parameters. They use an online experiment to compare their approach to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task completion time. The authors assess predictive accuracy in an out-of-sample task and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, their results indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while taking respondents about the same time to complete. The insight for management: New methodologies enable better estimation of underlying preferences.Human Capital Investments and Employee Performance: An Analysis of IT Services Industry (p. 641) Ravi Bapna, Nishtha Langer, Amit Mehra, Ram Gopal, Alok Gupta Does training pay in quickly changing industries? The rapid pace of technological innovation necessitates that information technology (IT) services firms continually invest in replenishing the skills of their key asset base, human capital. The authors examine whether human capital investments directed toward employee training are effective in improving employee performance. The authors identify a significant positive impact of training on employee performance: A unit increase in training is linked to a 2.14% increase in an employee's performance. Interestingly, they find that, in the IT sector, skills atrophy and consequently high-experience employees reap higher returns from training, which highlights the uniquely dynamic nature of IT knowledge and skills. The authors find that this holds true for general training that an employee can utilize outside the focal firm but that specific training pertinent to the focal firm is not positively linked to performance. The insight for management: The value of training depends on the content; firm-specific training is less likely to improve performance than general training.The Pitfalls of Subsystem Integration: When Less Is More (p. 659) Sanjiv Erat, Stylianos Kavadias, Cheryl Gaimon How much integration is too much? In various industries end-product manufacturers acquire core subsystems from upstream technology provider firms and focus primarily on efficient end-product integration. The authors examine the strategic interactions between a technology firm that introduces a new subsystem and the respective end-product manufacturers (\u201cintegrators\u201d). They analyze how the fraction of end-product functionalities prepackaged into the subsystem impacts the optimal introduction strategy and the relative value appropriation power across the industries. Offering a subsystem that performs many end-product functions has a dual effect on the provider's profits. On the positive side, the provider extracts a higher ease-of-use rent from the integrators because of the easier/cheaper integration. On the negative side, such subsystems may curtail the adopters' ability for competitive differentiation and render adoption less valuable. The insight for management: Overly integrated supply chains may hinder competitive differentiation and thus product adoption and market potential.Clustering, Agency Costs and Operating Efficiency: Evidence from Nursing Home Chains (p. 677) Susan F. Lu, Gerard J. Wedig What are the benefits and costs of retail chains? Chains possess scalable advantages that explain their existence, including branding, superior business models, and learning strategies. However, if managers cannot be incented contractually, private ownership is thought to be the primary organizational substitute. The authors explore geographic clustering as an alternative strategy for controlling managerial agency costs within the chain form of organization. Clustering nursing homes may facilitate scale efficiencies in both monitoring and supervision, resulting in reduced agency costs and improved application of the chain's business model. The insight for management: Clustered nursing homes achieve higher quality.Price Discovery in the U.S. Treasury Market: Automation vs. Intermediation (p. 695) Kasing Man, Junbo Wang, Chunchi Wu How has automation affected market efficiency in trading markets? To understand this phenomenon, the authors examine the contribution to price discovery by electronic and voice-based trading systems in the U.S. Treasury market. Evidence shows that the electronic trading system has more price discovery and that trading automation increases the speed of incorporating information into prices. However, human trading generates significant price discovery, though its volume is low. The relative contribution of a trading system to price discovery depends on liquidity, volatility, volume, trade size, and order imbalance. The voice-based trading system contributes more to price discovery when trade size is large and liquidity is low. The insight for management: The ideal design of markets for securities depends on market characteristics and trading environments.Market Crashes, Correlated Illiquidity, and Portfolio Choice (p. 715) Hong Liu, Mark Loewenstein The recent financial crisis highlights several potentially important fundamental elements for optimal portfolio choice. First, event risks such as a market crash may be significant; second, market liquidity may dry up after a crash; third, the probability of another crash may increase after a crash; and, fourth, other investment opportunity set parameters (e.g., market volatility) may also change after a crash. The authors propose a portfolio choice model where market crashes can trigger switching into another regime with a different investment opportunity set. In contrast to standard portfolio choice models, changes in the investment opportunity set in one regime can affect the optimal trading strategy in another regime even in the absence of transaction costs. The insight for management: Portfolio choice might change dramatically in the case of broad shifts in market prices.Estimating Structural Models of Equilibrium and Cognitive Hierarchy Thinking in the Field: The Case of Withheld Movie Critic Reviews (p. 733) Alexander L. Brown, Colin F. Camerer, Dan Lovallo Do moviegoers realize that a lack of prerelease reviews may signal a low-quality film? Studios sometimes withhold movies from critics before their release, opting instead for a \u201ccold opening.\u201d Because the unreviewed movies tend to be below average in quality, this practice provides a useful setting in which to test models of limited strategic thinking. Previously, the authors found that a cold opening produces a significant 20%\u201330% increase in domestic box office revenue, which is consistent with moviegoers' overestimating the quality of unreviewed movies. The insight for management: Limited strategic thinking rather than equilibrium reasoning may be a better explanation for na\u00efve moviegoer behavior.The Effect of CRM Outsourcing on Shareholder Value: A Contingency Perspective (p. 748) Kartik Kalaignanam, Tarun Kushwaha, Jan-Benedict E. M. Steenkamp, Kapil R. Tuli How does information systems (IS) outsourcing affect firm performance? Previous research has shown that the increasingly common practice of outsourcing back-office IS generally has a positive effect on shareholder value of the outsourcing firm. Much less is known about the performance implications of outsourcing of another important IS function, namely, front-office customer relationship management (CRM) systems, where the vendor uses its own personnel and software to perform several CRM tasks. The authors find that CRM outsourcing is more beneficial to firms that are high on information technology capabilities and low on marketing capabilities, and that it is less beneficial when it concerns presales CRM. Similarly, although vendor economic distance has a positive influence on the outsourcing firm's shareholder value, vendor cultural distance has a negative influence. These effects are in turn significantly moderated by the type of CRM process outsourced. The insight for management: CRM outsourcing is more beneficial for firms with high information technology capabilities and lower marketing capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1726","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['diversity', 'same-sex domestic partnership', 'investment', 'performance', 'operating performance']","The article discusses the performance implications of firms adopting same-sex domestic partnership benefits, indicating a moderate focus on diversity and inclusion.

We find that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed.

Allen, we contribute to the emerging microlevel theory of knowledge recombination by examining how individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their technological recombinations. Our data set combines information from 30,550 European patents with matched survey data obtained from 1,880 inventors. The analysis supports the view that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, top-level technological domains) than inventors with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of inventors. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our findings provide several new insights for research on inventors, the literature on organizational learning and innovation, and strategy research.

We define momentum as a sustained and systematic trajectory in performance over time, and we argue that such trends impact interpretations of current performance as well as expectations of future performance. Drawing on the variable focus of attention model, we posit that momentum therefore directs the focus of organizational attention between concerns of aspirations, survival, and slack. Our conceptual model accounts for momentum that occurs within a performance period as well as that which occurs across periods. We propose that within- and across-period momentums are unique in terms of when and how each type impacts risk taking. We tested and found support for our hypotheses in the context of 22,603 play-by-play decisions made by the 32 teams of the National Football League during the 2000\u20132005 regular season games.

Platforms facing unfavorable expectations face an additional constraint: their prices and first-party content investment need to be such that low (zero) participation equilibria are eliminated. This additional constraint typically leads them to invest more (less) in first-party content relative to platforms facing favorable expectations when first- and third-party content are substitutes (complements). These results hold with both simultaneous and sequential entry of the two sides. With two competing platforms\u2014incumbent facing favorable expectations and entrant facing unfavorable expectations\u2014and multi-homing on one side of the market, the incumbent always invests (weakly) more in first-party content relative to the case in which it is a monopolist.

To do so, we provide a general framework to model the evolutions of forecasts generated by multiple decision makers who forecast demand for the same product. We also model the evolutions of forecasts when decision makers have asymmetric demand information and refer to it as the Martingale Model of Asymmetric Forecast Evolutions. This model helps us study mechanism design problems in a dynamic environment. In particular, we consider a supplier's (principal's) problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer (agent) when both firms obtain asymmetric demand information for the end product over multiple periods. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase (respectively, decrease) the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher (respectively, lower) cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. Considering all such trade-offs, the supplier has to determine (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism. This paper provides an answer to these questions. In doing so, we develop a new solution approach for a class of dynamic mechanism design problems. In addition, this paper provides a framework to quantify the option value of time for a strategic investment decision under the dynamic evolutions of asymmetric forecasts.

Our empirical analysis, using the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System database, is consistent with theoretical predictions of (i) sorting by ability into basic versus applied science among academic scientists, but not among industry scientists; and (ii) sorting by higher taste for nonmonetary returns into academia over industry.

We argue that strong ties to potentially influential organization members who are ambivalent about a change (fence-sitters) provide the change agent with an affective basis to coopt them. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. By contrast, strong ties to potentially influential organization members who disapprove of a change outright (resistors) are an effective means of affective cooptation only when a change diverges little from institutionalized practices. With more divergent changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors accruing to the change agent are weaker, and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption.

To respond to the public's demand for data privacy, a class of clustering-based data masking techniques is increasingly being used for privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics. Although they address reidentification risks, traditional clustering-based approaches for masking numeric attributes typically do not consider the disclosure risk of categorical confidential attributes. We propose a new approach to deal with this problem. The proposed method clusters data such that the data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. To accomplish this, the clustering method, which is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) technique, uses two risk-utility trade-off measures in the growing and pruning stages of the MST technique, respectively. As part of our approach we also propose a novel cluster-level microperturbation method for masking data that overcomes a common problem of traditional clustering-based methods for data masking, which is their inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. We show that the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the masked data generated using the microperturbation method are unbiased estimates of the original mean vector and covariance matrix. An experimental study on several real-world data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Using a longitudinal data set consisting of the body mass index of 3,164 children up to age 18 and another longitudinal data set containing the body mass index at ages 18 and 40 and the presence or absence of disease (hypertension and diabetes) at age 40 for 747 people, we formulate and numerically solve\u2014separately for boys and girls\u2014a dynamic programming problem for the optimal biennial (i.e., at ages 2,4,\u2026,16) obesity screening thresholds. Unlike most screening problem formulations, we take a societal viewpoint, where the state of the system at each age is the population-wide probability density function of the body mass index. Compared to the biennial version of the task force's recommendation, the screening thresholds derived from the dynamic program achieve a relative reduction in disease prevalence of 3% at the same screening (and treatment) cost, or\u2014because of the flatness of the disease versus screening trade-off curve\u2014achieves the same disease prevalence at a 28% relative reduction in cost. Compared to the task force's policy, which uses the 95th percentile of body mass index (from cross-sectional growth charts tabulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as the screening threshold for each age, the dynamic programming policy treats mostly 16-year-olds (including many who are not obese) and very few males under 14 years old. Although our results suggest that adult hypertension and diabetes are minimized by focusing childhood obesity screening and treatment on older adolescents, the shortcomings in the available data and the narrowness of the medical outcomes considered prevent us from making a recommendation about childhood obesity screening policies.

We find that consumers who know the add-on fees can be penalized\u2014and increasingly so\u2014by the existence of boundedly rational consumers. Our consideration of quality asymmetries on base goods and add-ons, plus the inclusion of boundedly rational consumers, leads to several novel findings regarding firm profits. When quality asymmetry is on base goods only and with boundedly rational consumers, add-on pricing can diminish profit for a qualitatively superior firm and increase profit for an inferior firm (i.e., a lose\u2013win result), compared to when add-on pricing is prohibited or infeasible. When quality asymmetries exist on both base goods and add-ons and without boundedly rational consumers, the opposite win\u2013lose result prevails. When quality asymmetries exist on both base goods and add-ons and with boundedly rational consumers, the result can be win\u2013win, win\u2013lose, or lose\u2013win, depending on the magnitude of quality differentiation on add-ons.

In this paper, we study a project requiring two stages of investment. Failure to fund Stage 1 of the investment precludes investment in Stage 2, whereas failure to fund Stage 2 results in early termination. In contrast to the existing literature, we assume that the firm can limit the manager's informational rents with the early termination of the project. In this setting, we find that the firm optimally commits to a capital allocation scheme whereby it forgoes positive net present value (NPV) projects at Stage 1 (capital rationing), whereas at Stage 2, depending on the manager's previous report, it sometimes implements projects with a negative continuation NPV but in other situations forgoes implementing projects with positive continuation NPVs.

In reality, retailers often make such guarantees contingent on the verification of product availability at the competitor's location, and decline a price-match request if the product is not available there. This creates certain consternation on the part of customers. In this paper, we investigate the availability contingency strategy from the perspectives of both the retailers and the customers. Our analysis shows that availability contingency clauses intensify inventory competition between retailers and reinstitutes price competition, which is otherwise eliminated by unconditional price-matching guarantees. Consequently, despite what customers may think about the availability verification, it actually increases their surplus. On the other hand, such a clause reduces profits and, hence, is not the equilibrium strategy for retailers. Subsequently, we discuss how a likely customer behaviour pattern may be a plausible explanation regarding the use of the clause by the retailers in practice.

(p. 771) Anat Bracha, Chaim Fershtman Can we design work incentives to spur employees to work both harder and smarter? Almost all jobs require a combination of cognitive effort and labor effort. The authors examine the effect that incentive schemes have on the chosen combination of cognitive and labor effort. They show that competitive incentives may induce agents to work harder but not necessarily smarter. The insight for management: It is difficult to think under pressure, and therefore competitive pressure has a negative impact on cognitive effort but a positive impact on labor effort.Analyzing Screening Policies for Childhood Obesity (p. 782) Yan Yang, Jeremy D. Goldhaber-Fiebert, Lawrence M. Wein What can be done about obesity? Because of the health and economic costs of childhood obesity, coupled with studies suggesting the benefits of comprehensive intervention (dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral counseling), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended childhood screening and intervention for obesity beginning at age 6. The authors use a data set consisting of the body mass index of children up to age 18 and another data set containing the body mass index at ages 18 and 40 with the presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes to formulate the optimal biennial obesity screening thresholds from a societal viewpoint. The insight for management: Adult hypertension and diabetes can be minimized by focusing childhood obesity screening and treatment on older adolescents, but the optimal childhood obesity screening policies are as yet unclear.Class-Restricted Clustering and Microperturbation for Data Privacy  (p. 796) Xiao-Bai Li, Sumit Sarkar How can businesses leverage the plethora of data now available without threatening the privacy of their customers? The extensive use of information technologies by organizations to collect and share personal data has raised strong privacy concerns. For example, AOL drew fire for releasing 20 million search queries to the public, and Netflix had to cancel the second round of its movie recommendation competition because its customers were concerned about their privacy and being \u201creidentified\u201d\u2014that is, individually identified even though the personal information was stripped. The authors propose a method of clustering data so that data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. They also propose a \u201cmicroperturbation\u201d method for masking data that overcomes other clustering methods' inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. The insight for management: It is possible to distribute and gain insights from data without threatening the privacy of those who generated it by masking private details without reducing the information that can be gleaned from it.Managing Strategic Inventories via Manufacturer-to-Consumer Rebates  (p. 813) Anil Arya, Brian Mittendorf Do you clip coupons? In 2011, coupons alone accounted for $4.6 billion in consumer redemptions, and it is estimated that other postpurchase rebates have soared to $8 billion annually. Manufacturer-to-consumer rebates are a staple of modern supply chains. Such rebates are typically viewed as a means of price discrimination because of partial redemption by consumers. However, the proliferation of universally redeemed instant rebates suggests that the practice may be motivated by additional considerations. The authors suggest that consumer rebates can be particularly useful when a supply chain shows inefficiencies from retailers holding excess inventory to convey a lower willingness to pay in the future to undercut future wholesale prices. As a retaliatory consequence, the manufacturer sets high near-term wholesale prices. The \u201cpull\u201d promotion from consumer rebates encourages more timely retail sales and in doing so undercuts (but does not eliminate) the retailer's strategic inventories. Surprisingly, the authors find that the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers alike all benefit from the use of rebates, despite the fact that the manufacturer uses the rebates in self-interest and as a strategic weapon. The insight for management: The introduction of consumer rebates can serve as an enticement for retailers to sell, not just for consumers to buy.Overcoming Resistance to Organizational Change: Strong Ties and Affective Cooptation (p. 819) Julie Battilana, Tiziana Casciaro Keep your friends close and your enemies closer! The authors develop a theory of how members of an organization use the strength of ties in their network to overcome resistance to change. The authors propose that potentially influential \u201cfence sitters\u201d can be affected by strong ties to change agents. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. However, ties to influential organization resistors to change work only for small changes. With bigger changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors are weaker and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption. The insight for management: Team with resistors to stop a leak but not a tidal wave; team with change agents to create one.Knowledge Recombination Across Technological Boundaries: Scientists vs. Engineers (p. 837) Marc Gruber, Dietmar Harhoff, Karin Hoisl How do individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their recombination of different technologies to generate radical innovations? This ability has been viewed as the \u201choly grail\u201d of innovation research for a century. The authors reviewed 30,550 European patents from 1,880 inventors and found that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries than those with an engineering degree, but a doctoral degree is  associated with increased recombination breadth. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with time since his formal education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. The insight for management: Broader and deeper education of inventors leads to broader creativity and recombination of ideas than a narrower engineering degree.Momentum and Organizational Risk Taking: Evidence from the National Football League (p. 852) David W. Lehman, Jungpil Hahn Does going for it on fourth down build momentum, or is the risk unwarranted? The authors reviewed 22,603 play-by-play decisions made by the 32 teams of the National Football League during the 2000\u20132005 regular season games. They evaluate how such risks affect slack (resources in excess of current performance), aspirations (based on past performance or on the performance of other organizations), and survival. Most importantly, such risk-taking behaviors seem to be affected by momentum. The insight for management: Risk taking builds on itself; better forecasts of future firm behaviors might be achieved by taking momentum into account.Multistage Capital Budgeting with Delayed Consumption of Slack (p. 869) Stanley Baiman, Mirko S. Heinle, Richard Saouma How can a firm's capital budgeting policies balance investment efficiency against managers' consumption of perquisites? To limit the opportunities for managers to divert capital funds for private benefit, firms use their managerial accounting systems and audits of their capital projects. For example, these systems can easily uncover, and thereby preclude, the manager's diversion of capital funds from appropriate investments to private uses such as vacations or excess compensation. However, it is more difficult for these systems to distinguish between investments in necessary and unnecessary assets, provided that both fall within the general class of appropriate purchases. For instance, it may be difficult to detect that a manager is engaging in empire building (acquiring unnecessary hard assets such as research equipment, cars, or offices, or unnecessary soft assets such as staff and consulting services) from which he derives private benefits. Thus, at best the firm's accounting and auditing systems may mitigate a manager's misuse by constraining the set of assets into which he can divert capital funds for private benefit. For example, the private benefit of lavish offices is consumed over the time that the manager actually uses these offices (as compared to excess compensation or vacations, whose benefits are consumed immediately). The insight for management: Restricting investment to specific asset classes can reduce the private benefit to the manager to those consumed over time.Failure and Rescue in an Interbank Network (p. 882) L. C. G. Rogers, L. A. M. Veraart How do interbank obligations affect the fragility of our financial system? Over the last 10 or so years, there has been a growth of interest in the general phenomenon of the spread of bank failure through a network of interbank obligations. As the Asian banking crisis of the late 1990s and the more recent banking crisis of 2007\u20132008 have shown, the banking system generally can be very vulnerable to deterioration of assets, loss of liquidity, and loss of confidence. The authors study systemic risk in an interbank market, modeled as a directed graph of interbank obligations. The authors are able to analyze how failing banks might be rescued by consortia of other banks, establishing the important results that any consortium that has an incentive to rescue the failing banks also has the means and that any consortium of banks that would fail if default were allowed to spread would have an incentive to rescue if it had the means. The insight for management: Modeling may allow for reduced risks in and improved rescue mechanisms for our financial system.Add-on Pricing by Asymmetric Firms (p. 899) Jeffrey D. Shulman, Xianjun Geng What is the effect of add-on pricing on profitability and customer satisfaction? Consumers are often faced with fees for add-ons not included in the price of a base product (or service). For example, hotel guests, after room rates are already paid, often have to pay additional charges for services such as Internet access, parking, and use of a safe, a fitness center, and a pool. Banks charge fees for consumers who opt to cancel a check, use a foreign ATM, or use a debit card. Air travelers frequently find themselves paying for pet transport, snacks, checked luggage, and even blankets. Cell phone service providers charge subscribers to send text messages and download data. The authors examine the consequences of add-on pricing with consumers who are unaware of the add-on fees at the time of initial purchase. As it turns out, who benefits depends on the knowledge of the quality of the base product and the add-on items. The insight for management: Before a firm engages in add-on pricing strategies, it should evaluate the quality of base and add-on products.Publicizing Performance (p. 918) G\u00fcnter Strobl, Edward D. Van Wesep Why not hide employee success from competitors to reduce poaching? Firms often do not attempt to keep their best employees hidden. Indeed, they often do just the opposite, by giving good employees impressive-sounding job titles and awards and, if asked, providing good letters of recommendation. This behavior is puzzling, because it makes it easier for competitors to poach a firm's best employees. As it turns out, firms that establish reputations for hiring young workers and promoting those who succeed lose good workers to competitors but can pay less to young, inexperienced workers in exchange. The authors find that firms with reputations for publicizing performance are able to pay less to employees at every level of tenure and thus earn economic profit but that these firms will never be the most productive in the economy. The insight for management: Public celebration of employee success may risk poaching and higher turnover, but the in-kind payment may also allow for the firm to pay lower employee wages.First-Party Content and Coordination in Two-Sided Markets (p. 933) Andrei Hagiu, Daniel Spulber Bill Gates said, \u201cContent is king.\u201d This statement rings true because many firms use content as in-kind payments to attract customers. But how should this content be coordinated? The software, Internet, and mobile communications revolutions have created information distribution systems of unprecedented efficiency and vast markets for content (e.g., news, entertainment, data, software applications, games, articles, books, music, images, and video). Examples of platforms supplying first-party content include the following: e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon) provide customer ratings, search engines (e.g., Google) provide search results (website links), social networks (e.g., Facebook) provide network information (friend suggestions), and the like. The authors find that the strategic use of first-party content by two-sided platforms is driven by two key factors: the nature of buyer and seller expectations (favorable versus unfavorable) and the nature of the relationship between first-party content and third-party content (complements or substitutes). The insight for management: Coordinating first- and third-party content depends on the market for such products and the complementarity of first- and third-party products.Industry or Academia, Basic or Applied? Career Choices and Earnings Trajectories of Scientists (p. 950) Rajshree Agarwal, Atsushi Ohyama They say, \u201cDifferent strokes for different folks,\u201d but what factors drive career choices and earnings trajectories? Many studies have looked at earnings potential of different career choices, but few have looked at the individual factors that contribute to career choice and the resulting self-sorting and earnings evolution. The authors link differences in physical capital investments and complementarities between basic and applied scientists across industry and academic settings to individual differences in scientist ability and preferences to predict an equilibrium matching of scientists to careers and to their earnings evolution. The study, based on the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System database, finds two results. First, there is a sorting by ability into basic versus applied science among academic scientists, but not among industry scientists. Second, there is a sorting by higher taste for nonmonetary returns into academia over industry. The evolution of an earnings profile is consistent with these sorting patterns: The earnings trajectories of basic and applied scientists are distinct from each other in academia but are similar in industry. The insight for management: There is a natural sorting by individual preference into theoretical and applied sciences and into industry and academia that drives earnings trajectories.Competitive Price-Matching Guarantees: Equilibrium Analysis of the Availability Verification Clause Under Demand Uncertainty (p. 971) Arcan Nalca, Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray,  Many advertisers claim, \u201cNo lower prices, anywhere!\u201d But what value is the claim if the shopper has the onus of proving the claim wrong? Price-matching guarantees involve a retailer matching the lower price of a competitor for an identical product. In reality, retailers often make such guarantees contingent on the verification of product availability at the competitor's location and decline a price-match request if the product is not available there. This creates certain consternation on the part of customers. The authors show that availability contingency clauses intensify inventory competition between retailers and reinstitute price competition, which is otherwise eliminated by unconditional price-matching guarantees. Consequently, despite what customers may think about the availability verification, it actually makes them better off. On the other hand, such a clause reduces profits and, hence, is not an ideal strategy for retailers. The insight for management: Availability contingency clauses on price guarantees sound like a safeguard for retailers, but, in fact, they reduce prices and increase inventory availability competition, making retailers worse off and consumers better off.Mechanism Design for Capacity Planning Under Dynamic Evolutions of Asymmetric Demand Forecasts (p. 987) Sechan Oh, \u00d6zalp \u00d6zer Should a supplier build its capacity to meet manufacturer forecasts? Forecast information sharing has been touted as a great value toward increasing the efficiency of supply chains. But these forecasts must be accurate and unbiased to be useful. The authors consider a supplier's problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. The insight for management: This paper shows the supplier (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1733","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['privacy', 'obesity', 'ethical']","The article discusses various management insights, including data privacy concerns and childhood obesity interventions, which touch on ethical considerations.

In the first-stage game, airlines negotiate fixed proration rates to share the revenues generated by such itineraries. In the second-stage game, airlines operate independent inventory control systems to maximize their own expected revenues. We derive a revenue-sharing rule that is (i) an admissible outcome of the first-stage negotiation, in the sense that no airline coalition has enough incentives to secede from the grand alliance, and (ii) efficient for the second-stage game, in the sense that the decentralized system can achieve the same revenues as a central planner managing the global alliance network. Our numerical study shows that the proposed proration rates can lead to a significant increase in revenues with respect to other rules commonly used in practice. Finally, because our proposal requires the disclosure of private demand information, we introduce a simple alternative rule that is based on public information. This heuristic performs remarkably well, becoming an interesting candidate to be pursued in practice.

Applying both robust goal congruence and sequential adverse selection frameworks, we show that the optimal capital budgeting mechanism entails a capital charge rate above the firm's cost of capital in the first stage but below the cost of capital in the second stage. Further, the first-stage asset cost-sharing rule depends only on the relative divisional growth profiles, and equal cost sharing can be optimal even when the divisions receive significantly different benefits from the shared investment project. In the presence of an adverse selection problem, all agency costs are incorporated into the second-stage budgeting mechanism, leaving the first-stage capital charge rate and asset-sharing rule unaffected even though the agency problem induces capital rationing at both stages.

The constant private shock revealed at time 0 when the agent selects the contract has a long-term impact on the optimal contract.

The good agent is retired when the temptation value of the bad agent becomes large, because then it is expensive to motivate the good agent. The bad agent is retired when the temptation value of the good agent becomes small, because then the future payment does not provide sufficient incentives.

When consumer heterogeneity is uniformly distributed either vertically on willingness to pay or horizontally on transaction costs, a manufacturer may provide the same or lower product quality in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. In contrast, when consumer heterogeneity follows a more general distribution on willingness to pay, under certain conditions, the manufacturer may provide higher product quality in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. Decentralization also may lead to a higher product quality if consumer heterogeneity is uniformly distributed both vertically and horizontally, but not if consumer heterogeneity is uniformly distributed vertically on each of two product-quality attributes.

The existing policy consists of a daily payment for each patient under care with a global cap of revenues accrued during the Medicare year, which increases with each newly admitted patient. We investigate the hospice's expected profit and provide reasons for a spate of recent provider bankruptcies related to the reimbursement policy; recommendations to alleviate these problems are given. We also analyze a hospice's incentives for patient management, finding several unintended consequences of the Medicare reimbursement policy. Specifically, a hospice may seek short-lived patients (such as cancer patients) over patients with longer expected lengths of stay. The effort with which hospices seek out, or recruit, such patients will vary during the year. Furthermore, the effort they apply to actively discharge a patient whose condition has stabilized may also depend on the time of year. These phenomena are unintended and undesirable but are a direct consequence of the Medicare reimbursement policy. We propose an alternative reimbursement policy to ameliorate these shortcomings.

The proposed model accounts for the data better than several alternative models. The results show that consumers switch frequently between acquisition strategies, and they obtain information on only two or three attributes or products in a particular acquisition strategy before switching.

We build a model that helps understand how licensing activity should be organized within large corporations. More specifically, we compare decentralization\u2014where the business unit using the technology makes licensing decisions\u2014to centralized licensing. The business unit has superior information about licensing opportunities but may not have the appropriate incentives because its rewards depend on product market performance. If licensing is decentralized, the business unit forgoes valuable licensing opportunities because the rewards for licensing are (optimally) weaker than those for product market profits. This distortion is stronger when production-based incentives, especially private benefits, of business unit managers are more powerful, making centralization more attractive. Surprisingly, we find that interdependency across business units may result in more, not less, decentralization. Furthermore, even though centralization results in less information, centralized licensing deals are larger. Our model conforms to the existing evidence that reports heterogeneity across firms in both licensing propensity and organization of licensing.

Material needs capital, and sales contribute cash. Therefore, it may be beneficial to coordinate operational and financial decisions. We study a dynamic model of coordination in an equity-financed firm in which inventory and financial decisions interact in the presence of demand uncertainty, financial constraints, and a risk of default. The criterion is to maximize the expected present value of dividends net of capital subscriptions. The optimal target inventory level and financial decision variables are nondecreasing functions of the levels of inventory and retained earnings. Some important attributes of an optimal policy remain the same regardless of whether default precipitates Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The optimal policy is myopic, and if pertinent cost functions are piecewise linear, it is characterized with simple formulas.

The first resource, an investigator, handles the first step, in which she collects information from the customer and decides what work will be done in the second step by the second resource, the back office. In the third step, the investigator returns to the customer armed with the additional information or analysis done by the back office and provides the customer with a conclusion, solution, or diagnosis. The investigator has to prioritize either seeing a new customer or completing the work with a customer already in the system. While serving one customer, the investigator may be interrupted by requests from the other customers in the system. Our main objective is to understand the impact of the investigator's choices on system throughput. In addition, we are interested in the occupancy of the system (and thus the flow time of customers). We create a stylized queueing model to examine the investigator's decisions and show that, when interruptions are not an issue, the investigator should prioritize new customers to maximize throughput, keeping the system as full as possible. If customers who have been in the system for a long time generate interruptions and thus additional work for the investigator, we show that it is asymptotically optimal for the investigator to keep the system occupancy low and prioritize discharging customers. Our conclusions are based on a model of a re-entrant queue with dedicated servers serving multiple stations, with two novel features: a buffer that is shared between stations, and jobs in the system generating additional work for the servers.

Killaly, Tava Lennon Olsen, Rodney P. Parker How does the U.S. Medicare hospice reimbursement policy affect patient care and hospice finances? The existing policy consists of a daily payment for each patient under care with a global cap of revenues accrued during the Medicare year, which increases with each newly admitted patient. The authors provide reasons for a recent spate of provider bankruptcies related to the reimbursement policy and give recommendations to alleviate these problems. They find several unintended consequences of the Medicare reimbursement policy on a hospice's incentives for patient management. For example, a hospice may seek short-lived patients (such as cancer patients) over patients with longer expected lengths of stay. The policy also affects the effort with which hospices seek out, or recruit, such patients at different points in the year. Finally, the effort they apply to actively discharge a patient whose condition has stabilized may also depend on the time of year. The insight for management: Unintended and undesirable behaviors are a direct consequence of the current U.S. Medicare reimbursement policy.The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on Firm Value: The Role of Customer Awareness (p. 1045) Henri Servaes, Ane Tamayo Be aware!

Yet investment firms undertake their own buy-side research, and their analysts face different stock selection and recommendation incentives than their sell-side peers. The authors examine the selection and performance of stocks recommended by analysts at a large investment firm relative to those of sell-side analysts from mid-1997 to 2004. They find that the buy-side firm's analysts issue less optimistic recommendations for stocks with larger market capitalizations and lower return volatility than their sell-side peers, consistent with their facing fewer conflicts of interest and having a preference for liquid stocks.

It has been hypothesized that a stock's ownership breadth (i.e., the percentage of investors with long positions) both positively and negatively predicts its future returns. On one hand, a higher percentage of investors with long positions implies weaker short-sales constraints and a lower degree of stock overvaluation; therefore, greater ownership breadth predicts higher future returns. On the other hand, just the opposite may be true. When investor sentiment plays a major role in the financial market, such as in the Internet bubble, overly optimistic investors rush into a stock in a mania that leads to a high breadth of ownership. Or, in the subprime crisis, overly pessimistic investors sell a stock in a panic that leads to a low breadth of ownership. In these cases, a high level of ownership breadth is likely to be overvalued. These observations seem to suggest that ownership breadth negatively predicts future returns. The authors examine two offsetting forces\u2014disagreement and sentiment\u2014to resolve this contradiction. They find that the breadth\u2013return relationship is positive when the sentiment effect is small. However, the relationship becomes negative when the variation of market-wide sentiment is high and cross-sectional dispersion of firm-specific exposure to market-wide sentiment variation is large. The insight for management: Buying volumes can be good or bad indicators of future returns; there is high potential when disagreement among investors is high, and one should be wary when everyone seems to think it's a sure thing.Managing Licensing in a Market for Technology (p. 1092) Ashish Arora, Andrea Fosfuri, Thomas R\u00f8nde Should licensing of IT be centralized? Many firms, such as IBM, Texas Instruments, Hitachi, Dow, Kodak, Eli Lilly, and Procter & Gamble, have embraced a policy of actively licensing their intellectual property (IP) to others, earning millions of dollars in licensing revenues. In these companies, IP managers have pressures to increase direct income from IP, but individual business units in such companies might be reluctant to sell their IP for fear of losing a competitive advantage. As a result, lucrative deals are not consummated. Certainly, the business unit has superior information about licensing opportunities but may not have the appropriate incentives because its rewards depend on product market performance. The authors find that, although centralization results in less information, centralized licensing deals are larger. The insight for management: Understanding and managing complex incentive and information structures in technology organizations is critical to managing IP successfully.Control of Dividends, Capital Subscriptions, and Physical Inventories (p. 1107) Lode Li, Martin Shubik, Matthew J. Sobel How closely should finance departments and operations departments work together? Manufacturers manage interrelated flows of material and cash. Material needs capital, and sales contribute cash. Therefore, it may be beneficial to coordinate operational and financial decisions. The authors study a firm making inventory and financial decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty, financial constraints, and a risk of default. The firm strives to maximize the expected present value of dividends of capital subscriptions. It turns out that the optimal policy is myopic and can be characterized with simple formulas in most cases. The insight for management: The methods of inventory theory are useful in analyzing models of operational and financial coordination.Optimal Workflow Decisions for Investigators in Systems with Interruptions (p. 1125) Gregory Dobson, Tolga Tezcan, Vera Tilson Who's next? In emergency rooms, law offices, insurance companies, and banks, we see a common service model. An \u201cinvestigator\u201d (nurse, lawyer, insurance agent) acts as the customer interface for information collection and dissemination, and a second \u201cback office\u201d resource (such as lab technician, paralegal, or analyst) provides the investigator with analysis and data collection. The investigator must decide in what order work will be done by the back office and must prioritize either seeing a new customer or completing the work with a customer already in the system. While serving one customer, the investigator may be interrupted by requests from the other customers in the system. The authors characterize the impact of the investigator's choices on system throughput, occupancy, and service time. They show that, when interruptions are not an issue, the investigator should prioritize new customers to maximize throughput, keeping the system as full as possible. If customers who have been in the system for a long time generate interruptions and thus additional work for the investigator, it is optimal for the investigator to keep the system occupancy low and prioritize discharging customers. The insight for management: In common service processes, maximize work in process if interruptions are low, and reduce work in process through focusing on discharging customers.The Evolving Impact of Combinatorial Opportunities and Exhaustion on Innovation by Business Groups as Market Development Increases: The Case of Taiwan (p. 1142) Ishtiaq Mahmood, Chi-Nien Chung, Will Mitchell Do high density and exposure enhance or curtail innovation? Business groups are key sources of innovation in emerging market economies, but we understand little about why innovativeness differs across groups and over time. Variation in the density of intragroup buyer\u2013supplier ties, which are common structural linkages among group affiliates, can help explain both cross-sectional and temporal heterogeneity of group innovativeness. The authors argue that greater buyer\u2013supplier density within a group initially creates opportunities that contribute to group innovativeness but ultimately generates exhaustion that constrains innovation. Combinatorial exhaustion will set in at lower levels of density as the market environment becomes more developed because the opportunity costs of local search increase. The insight for management: There is a dynamic element to business-group innovation; in early stages density is a boon, but in later stages it is a bane.Consumer Heterogeneity, Product Quality, and Distribution Channels (p. 1162) Hongyan Shi, Yunchuan Liu, Nicholas C. Petruzzi Different supply chains for different folks? Under some conditions, when consumers vary on willingness to pay or on transaction costs, a manufacturer may provide the same or lower product quality in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. But in others the manufacturer may provide higher product quality in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. The findings depend on the distribution of the preferences of the consumer. Additionally, competition at the retail level may amplify these findings. The insight for management: The effect of different distribution channel structures on product quality depends on the type of consumer heterogeneity in a market.Revenue Sharing in Airline Alliances (p. 1177) Xing Hu, Ren\u00e9 Caldentey, Gustavo Vulcano  How should airlines in a marketing alliance split revenues? Code-sharing alliances have grown in importance in the airline industry. What is the best structure for these alliances? First, airlines negotiate fixed proration rates to share the revenues generated by shared itineraries, then each airline operates independent inventory control systems to maximize their own expected revenues. The authors create a revenue-sharing rule that no airline coalition has incentive to secede from the grand alliance. The rule is also efficient for the second stage, in the sense that the decentralized system can achieve the same revenues as a central planner managing the global alliance network. The authors demonstrate that the proposed proration rates can lead to a significant increase in revenues with respect to other rules commonly used in practice. The authors also introduce a simple alternative rule that is based strictly on public information. The insight for management: A proposed revenue-sharing rule for airline alliances could create improved cooperation and greater revenue generation.Facilitating Fit Revelation in the Competitive Market (p. 1196) Zheyin (Jane) Gu, Ying Xie Can a firm help a consumer know if they will like a product before they try it? A firm can choose to engage in marketing activities to assist consumers in finding the fit between their personal tastes and the products' attributes. The authors find that competitive firms' strategies to facilitate fit revelation critically depend on the product qualities that they offer. In particular, a firm offering a high-quality product is more likely to facilitate fit revelation in the competitive market than it would as a market monopolist, whereas a firm offering a low-quality product is less likely to do so. The insight for management: Individualized product \u201cfit\u201d advertising is more appropriate for suppliers of a high-quality product.Multistage Capital Budgeting for Shared Investments (p. 1213) Nicole Bastian Johnson, Thomas Pfeiffer, Georg Schneider In a two-stage capital budgeting decision, how should investment decisions be made where multiple divisions can initiate profitable projects if the firm acquires a shared asset at the first stage? The authors show that the optimal capital budgeting mechanism entails a capital charge rate above the firm's cost of capital in the first stage but below the cost of capital in the second stage. Furthermore, the first-stage asset cost-sharing rule depends only on the relative divisional growth profiles, and equal cost sharing can be optimal even when the divisions receive significantly different benefits from the shared investment project. To ensure appropriate incentives and behaviors of all divisions, the central decision maker should focus on the second-stage costs. The insight for management: Structuring investment decisions and incentives carefully is critical for efficient capital allocation.Dynamics of Contract Design with Screening (p. 1229) Jak\u0161a Cvitani\u0107, Xuhu Wan, Huali Yang Is this the right person for the job? The authors evaluate ways to reduce contracting risks through better contract design and screening. Contracts are usually multiperiod, thus made with future uncertainty. Inherent risks of such contracts, including moral hazard (slacking off after the contract is signed) and adverse selection (taking a contract because it is the best a contractor can do), make the contract design and screening process critical to successful contracting. A \u201cbad agent\u201d (one with whom a contract should not be signed) has the temptation to misreport capabilities at the time of signing based on the value of the contract. That same value can be used to attract and motivate \u201cgood agents\u201d to sign. The insight for management: Careful use of screening contracts and shutdown contracts can attract the good agents and deter the bad ones, improving contracting success.Newsvendor Demand Chasing Revisited (p. 1245) Nelson Lau, J. Neil Bearden Does a big order today imply a big order tomorrow? Existing research suggests that individuals think that it does, which results in \u201cdemand chasing,\u201d or the adjustment of order quantities toward prior demand. The authors show this might not be the case, finding through simulation that a simple correlation measure can more accurately describe ordering processes' relation to demand without falsely identifying some orders as \u201cdemand chasing.\u201d The insight for management: A proposed measure of ordering and demand correlation better characterizes purchasing behaviors as they relate to demand patterns.Revisiting Almost Second-Degree Stochastic Dominance (p. 1250) Larry Y. Tzeng, Rachel J. Huang, Pai-Ta Shih What do we know about preferences of decision makers? The authors provide a counterexample to a prior theory related to revealed preferences of decision makers. The insight for management: New approaches give improved understanding of the preferences of decision makers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1750","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['consumer', 'information acquisition', 'decision making']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Systemic risk is an issue of great concern in modern financial markets as well as, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. We propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class of systemic risk measures that accomodate a rich set of regulatory preferences. This general class of systemic risk measures captures many specific measures of systemic risk that have recently been proposed as special cases and highlights their implicit assumptions. Moreover, the systemic risk measures that satisfy our conditions yield decentralized decompositions; i.e., the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due to individual agents. Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for systemic risk to each agent that correctly accounts for the externalities of the agent's individual decision making on the entire system.

Our results suggest that retailers with better opportunities for cross-selling have higher incentives to adopt loss-leader pricing on high-demand products than retailers with low cross-selling capabilities. As a result, price dispersion of a product across retailers rises when its demand increases. The predictions of our model are consistent with the empirical evidence from the online book retailing industry. Using product breadth as a proxy for cross-selling capability, we find that retailers with high cross-selling capabilities reduce prices on best sellers more aggressively than retailers with low cross-selling capabilities. As a result, price dispersion increases when a book makes it to the best-seller list, and the increase is mainly driven by the difference in pricing behavior between retailers with different cross-selling capabilities. Our empirical results are robust against a number of alternative explanations.

In some settings, forward-looking agents might purchase low-priced properties with the intention of trading up. From a design standpoint, such behavior is undesirable. We investigate a tiered structure as a potential solution. Using a model that endogenizes prematch acquisition decisions, we show that tiers promote exchange while protecting the primary market. In the laboratory, we find that both firm revenue and total social surplus are improved by tiered matching, and the amount of improvement depends on the exchange mechanism the firm uses. We focus on two popular mechanisms\u2014deposit first and request first. We find that subjects are less likely to take advantage of the match under tier-free deposit first mechanism, possibly because of risk aversion. Thus, a tiered approach is more critical under the request first mechanism. We confirm that risk aversion partly explains deviations from theory.

We find that funds initiate self-reporting after positive abnormal returns that do not persist into the reporting period. Termination of self-reporting is followed by both return deterioration and outflows from the funds. The propensity to self-report is consistent with the trade-offs between the benefits (e.g., access to prospective investors) and costs (e.g., partial loss of trading secrecy and flexibility in selective marketing). Finally, returns of self-reporting funds are higher than that of nonreporting funds using characteristic-based benchmarks. However, the difference is not significant using alternative choices of performance measures.

The supply base design concerns the number of suppliers (one or two) included in the supply base and the capacity to be invested in each supplier. The pricing mechanism determines the timing of the price decisions, with the buyer making price commitments before suppliers exert cost-reduction efforts that may be renegotiated afterward. We find that symmetric capacity investment in suppliers and low price commitments (more likely to be renegotiated) are effective at fostering supplier competition, whereas asymmetric investment and high price commitments (less likely to be renegotiated) are better at motivating supplier effort. A complementary relationship exists between the supply base design and pricing mechanism: A more symmetric supply base should be combined with lower price commitments, leading to more renegotiation opportunities. This results in three possible sourcing structures: sole sourcing (investing capacity in a single supplier and forming price with ex ante commitments), symmetric dual sourcing (investing equal capacity in both suppliers and forming price with ex post negotiations), and asymmetric dual sourcing (investing positive but unequal capacities in two (ex ante identical) suppliers and forming price using both ex ante commitments and ex post (re)negotiations).

We allow correlation between past and future activity time performance across activities. Our objective considers total completion time penalty plus crashing and overhead costs. We develop a robust optimization model that uses a conditional value-at-risk satisficing measure. We develop linear and piecewise-linear decision rules for activity start time and crashing decisions. These rules are designed to perform robustly against all possible scenarios of activity time uncertainty, when implemented in either static or rolling horizon mode. We compare our procedures against the previously available Program Evaluation and Review Technique and Monte Carlo simulation procedures.

The goal of this paper is to characterize the implications of demand censoring on performance. To that end, we compare the benchmark setting in which the DM has access to demand observations to a setting in which the DM may only rely on sales data. We measure performance in terms of regret: the difference between the cumulative costs of a policy and the optimal cumulative costs with knowledge of the demand distribution. Through upper and lower bounds, we characterize the optimal magnitude of the worst-case regret for the two settings, enabling one to isolate the implications of demand censoring. In particular, the results imply that the exploration\u2013exploitation trade-off introduced by demand censoring is fundamentally different in the continuous and discrete demand cases, and that active exploration plays a much stronger role in the latter case. We further establish that in the discrete demand case, the need for active exploration almost disappears as soon as a lost sales indicator (that records whether demand was censored or not) becomes available, in addition to the censored demand samples.

Many important decisions are routinely made by transient and temporary teams, who perform their duty and disperse. Subsequently, team members often continue making similar decisions as individuals. The authors study how the experience of team decision making affects subsequent individual decisions in two seminal probability and reasoning tasks: the Monty Hall problem and the Wason selection task. Their results show that teams trade closer to the rational level, learn the solution faster, and achieve this with weaker, less specific performance feedback than individuals. Most importantly, the authors observed significant knowledge transfers from team decision making to subsequent individual performances taking place up to five weeks later. The insight for management: Exposure to team decision making has strong positive spillovers on the quality of individual decisions.Inferring Reporting-Related Biases in Hedge Fund Databases from Hedge Fund Equity Holdings (p. 1271) Vikas Agarwal, Vyacheslav Fos, Wei Jiang Are there biases in financial self-reporting? The authors match the quarterly equity holdings of a complete list of 13F-filing hedge fund companies with five major commercial databases of self-reporting hedge funds between 1980 and 2008, and they find that funds initiate self-reporting after positive abnormal returns that do not persist into the reporting period. Termination of self-reporting is followed by both return deterioration and outflows from the funds. The propensity to self-report is based on benefits such as access to prospective investors and costs such as partial loss of trading secrecy and flexibility in selective marketing. The insight for management: Returns of self-reporting funds are higher than those of nonreporting funds using characteristic-based benchmarks; however, the difference is not significant using alternative choices of performance measures.Price Dispersion and Loss-Leader Pricing: Evidence from the Online Book Industry (p. 1290) Xinxin Li, Bin Gu, Hongju Liu What is the appropriate response to price competition in the face of changing demand? In October 2009, Walmart, Amazon, and Target cut their online prices for 10 best-selling items from $25 to $9, reportedly as loss leaders. Meanwhile, independent bookstores decided not to cut their prices as much to match their mega competitors. The authors develop a theoretical model to analyze the pricing strategies of competing retailers with different cross-selling capabilities when product demand changes. Their results suggest that retailers with better opportunities for cross-selling have higher incentives to adopt loss-leader pricing on high-demand products than retailers with low cross-selling capabilities. As a result, price dispersion of a product across retailers rises when its demand increases. The insight for management: Major retailers will demonstrate greater price dispersion than boutique sellers because of cross-selling opportunities.Treatment Effectiveness and Side Effects: A Model of Physician Learning (p. 1309) Tat Chan, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, Ying Xie How do treatment effectiveness and side effects affect the prescription decision of a risk-averse physician? How can patient feedback help reduce the physician's uncertainty about effectiveness and side effects? The authors identify the impact of patient feedback on drug effectiveness and side effects by studying erectile dysfunction prescription choices based on self-reported reasons for switching. Their results show that the drugs Levitra and Cialis have higher mean effectiveness than the older drug Viagra, but physicians have higher uncertainty about the effectiveness of Levitra and the side effects of Cialis. The insight for management: Patient self-reporting is critical for detailing the effectiveness and side effects of new entrants competing with incumbent drugs.Capital Markets and Firm Organization: How Financial Development Shapes European Corporate Groups (p. 1326) Sharon Belenzon, Tomer Berkovitz, Luis A. Rios How does financial development affect corporate groups in Europe? The authors investigate the effect of financial development on the formation of European corporate groups. They examine a comprehensive firm-level data set on European corporate groups in 15 countries and find that countries with less developed financial markets have a higher percentage of group affiliates in more capital-intensive industries. This relationship is more pronounced for young and small firms and for affiliates of large and diversified groups. The insight for management: Internal capital markets may, under some conditions, be more efficient than prevailing external markets, and this may drive group affiliation even in developed economies.The Fragility of Commitment (p. 1344) John Morgan, Felix V\u00e1rdy Can we count on your commitment? The authors show that the value of commitment is fragile in many standard games. When the follower faces a small cost to observe the leader's action, equilibrium payoffs are identical to the case where the leader's actions are unobservable. Applications of the result include classic standard Stackelberg\u2013Cournot and differentiated product Bertrand games, as well as forms of indirect commitment. The insight for management: Weakening full rationality in favor of boundedly rational solution concepts such as quantal-response equilibrium restores the value of commitment.Total Cost Control in Project Management via Satisficing (p. 1354) Joel Goh, Nicholas G. Hall How can projects with uncertain activity times and the possibility of expediting or crashing them best be managed? The authors established an objective that considers total completion time penalty plus crashing and overhead costs. They developed a robust optimization model that uses a conditional \u201cvalue-at-risk\u201d satisficing measure, and they developed decision rules for activity start time and crashing decisions that are designed to perform robustly against all possible scenarios of activity time uncertainty. They compare their procedures against the previously available Program Evaluation and Review Technique and Monte Carlo simulation procedures. Their computational studies show that, relative to previous approaches, their crashing policies provide a higher level of performance. The insight for management: New methods for project management under uncertain conditions can lead to higher success rates and lower project budget overruns.An Axiomatic Approach to Systemic Risk (p. 1373) Chen Chen, Garud Iyengar, Ciamac C. Moallemi As highlighted by the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the measurement and regulation of systemic risk of an economy or a financial market are of particular interest. Can such systemic risk be identified and managed? Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire complex system as a result of the actions taken by the individual component entities or agents that comprise the system. Systemic risk is an issue of great concern in modern financial markets and, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. The authors propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk, and they define a broad class of systemic risk measures that accommodate a rich set of regulatory preferences. The authors suggest that the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due to individual agents. The insight for management: Think locally to have global effect; externalities of individual agents' behaviors can be a driver in systemic risk in markets.Sourcing for Supplier Effort and Competition: Design of the Supply Base and Pricing Mechanism (p. 1389) Cuihong Li Manufacturers increasingly rely on suppliers to create value, reduce costs, and improve products or services. How can manufacturers balance the need for a diverse supply base and low costs? In the auto industry, most original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) create only 30%\u201335% of value internally. The author studies a buyer's sourcing strategy along two dimensions\u2014the supply base design and the pricing mechanism\u2014considering supplier competition and cost-reduction efforts. The supply base design concerns the number of suppliers (one or two) included in the supply base and the capacity to be invested in each supplier. The pricing mechanism determines the timing of the price decisions, with the buyer making price commitments before suppliers exert cost-reduction efforts that may be renegotiated afterward. The author finds that symmetric capacity investment in suppliers and low price commitments (more likely to be renegotiated) are effective in fostering supplier competition, whereas asymmetric investment and high price commitments (less likely to be renegotiated) are better at motivating supplier effort. A complementary relationship exists between the supply base design and pricing mechanism: A more symmetric supply base should be combined with lower price commitments, leading to more renegotiation opportunities. The insight for management: Three possible sourcing structures result depending on the emphases placed on pricing and competition: sole sourcing, symmetric dual sourcing, and asymmetric dual sourcing.On Implications of Demand Censoring in the Newsvendor Problem (p. 1407) Omar Besbes, Alp Muharremoglu How can demand be estimated when inventory runs out? The authors consider a \u201crepeated newsvendor\u201d problem in which the newsvendor does not have access to the underlying demand distribution. The authors compare the performance of two hypothetical vendors: One that has access to true demand and one that relies on sales data. The one that knows demand only exploits the knowledge; the one that does not must decide how much to \u201cexplore\u201d (carry inventory to learn demand) and how much to exploit. The insight for management: A \u201clost sales indicator\u201d that records whether demand was censored by inventory limits significantly reduces \u201cexploration\u201d and allows for \u201cexploitation,\u201d i.e., profit taking.Social Ties and User-Generated Content: Evidence from an Online Social Network (p. 1425) Scott K. Shriver, Harikesh S. Nair, Reto Hofstetter How do content creation and consumption relate? The authors examine activity at Soulrider.com, a privately held community website based in Europe that focuses on extreme sports such as windsurfing, surfing, and snowboarding. The site was launched in 2002 and as of June 2011 had a total of 10,677 registered users. Users can either consume or create content. The authors use changes in wind speeds at surfing locations in Switzerland as a source of variation in users' propensity to post content about their surfing activity on an online social network. They exploit this variation to test whether users' online content-generation activity is codetermined with their social ties. They find that increasing a user's social ties on the network may induce him to post more content, which then causes him to obtain more ties, which in turn causes him to post more content and so on. This process generates local positive feedback between ties and content, which thereby produces a self-reinforcing \u201cvirtuous cycle.\u201d Economically significant effects of this type can produce positive feedback that generates local network effects in content generation. When quantitatively significant, the increased content and tie density arising from the network effect induces more visitation and browsing on the site, which fuels growth by generating advertising revenue. The authors find evidence consistent with such network effects. The insight for management: An active social network member generates tremendous value for online networks.Social Networks, Information Acquisition, and Asset Prices (p. 1444) Bing Han, Liyan Yang In financial markets information is power, but what's your source? When information is exogenous, social communication improves market efficiency. However, social communication crowds out information production due to traders' incentives to \u201cfree ride\u201d on informed friends and on a more informative price system. The insight for management: Social communication may hurt market efficiency when information is endogenous; the network effects on the cost of capital, liquidity, trading volume, and welfare are also sensitive to whether information is endogenous; there are great implications of information networks for financial markets.Tiers in One-Sided Matching Markets: Theory and Experimental Investigation (p. 1458) Yu Wang, Ernan Haruvy How should \u201cmatching markets,\u201d such as fractional ownership markets in real estate, be structured? In fractional ownership markets, a household purchases a share of a property, which allows the owner to use the property for a specified period of time every year for the duration of the ownership. For example, a household can purchase a week of a three-bedroom house in Orlando. A secondary matching market allows the exchange of ownership rights of their properties. In some settings, speculators might purchase low-priced properties with the intention of trading up, which is an undesirable behavior. In an experiment, the authors propose a tiered structure. They find that both firm revenue and total social surplus are improved by tiered matching, and the amount of improvement depends on the exchange mechanism that the firm uses: deposit first or request first. The insight for management: Subjects are less likely to take advantage of the match under a tier-free deposit-first mechanism, possibly because of risk aversion. Thus, a tiered approach is more critical under the request-first mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1761","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and performance in teams without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Different determinants of product market competition have contrasting effects on firm size and managerial compensation. Although both firm size and managerial compensation increase with the entry cost, they increase with the elasticity of substitution if and only if firm size exceeds a high threshold but decrease if it is below a low threshold. Aggregate shocks to the firm productivity distribution affect incentives in our equilibrium framework. We show statistically and economically significant empirical support for several hypotheses derived from the theory that relates product market characteristics to managerial compensation, firm size, and the number of firms in the industry. Different determinants of competition indeed have contrasting effects, as predicted by the theory.

If the two buyers pool their demands and purchase from the supplier as a single entity, will they necessarily earn higher profits than purchasing separately? We show that when a powerful supplier extracts profits from the buyers through optimal contract design, the demand variability reduction achieved by pooling can harm the buyers because it makes extracting profits easier for the supplier. We characterize cases when pooling is disadvantageous and also provide insights into when it is still advantageous. Our result is in contrast to the case where the price of the component is exogenous (typically assumed in most of the pooling literature), in which case pooling demands is always beneficial for the buyers.

We first present the theoretical analysis for two types of markets where trade promotion discounts are offered either as off-invoices or as scan-backs. We derive propositions by comparing wholesale and retail prices, retailer order quantities, and profits given the same trade promotion discount. Next, we extend the basic model so that the amount of trade promotion discount influences market expansion and solve for the optimal discount level. To test our theory, we then employ market experiments where we manipulate demand uncertainty and market expansion. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that wholesale and retail prices are higher and retailer order quantities lower when the same amount of trade promotion discount is allocated to scan-backs versus off-invoices. In the market expansion condition, we find that manufacturers offer deeper discounts when trade promotions are allocated to off-invoices versus scan-backs. Overall, our research suggests that market experiments can shed light on trade promotion outcomes for which industry data are sparse or nonexistent.

To investigate this question, we analyze the decision making of National Football League teams during their annual player draft. This is a domain in which monetary stakes are exceedingly high and the opportunities for learning are rich. It is also a domain in which multiple psychological factors suggest that teams may overvalue the chance to pick early in the draft. Using archival data on draft-day trades, player performance, and compensation, we compare the market value of draft picks with the surplus value to teams provided by the drafted players. We find that top draft picks are significantly overvalued in a manner that is inconsistent with rational expectations and efficient markets, and consistent with psychological research.

Firms may invest in two measures to enhance system availability\u2014namely, failure prevention and recovery capacity. If recovery capacity investment is the only option, we find that the firms in a decentralized setting overinvest in capacity, resulting in higher system availability but at a higher cost. If both investments can be made, we find that the firms underinvest in failure prevention and overinvest in recovery capacity. That is, firms in a decentralized setting shift their focus from preventing failures to responding to failures. The net effect is lower system availability, reversing the conclusion above. We also find that, unexpectedly, firms are more willing to let their subsystems fail if a joint failure is more likely to occur.

This paper examines the inefficiency in the allocation of influenza vaccines that is due to interdependent risk of infection across borders and proposes a contractual mechanism to reduce such inefficiencies. The proposed contract is based on an epidemic model that accounts for intranational transmission and that from a source country where the dominant strain emerges. The contract reduces the overall financial burden of infection globally and improves the total number infected by seasonal influenza outbreaks. This is consistent with recent recommendations to improve pandemic preparedness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the benefits of the contract can prevent millions of influenza cases and save tens of millions of dollars, and that the benefits are even greater when cross-border transmission is higher, even if cross-border transmission parameters have moderate estimation errors.

We examine analytical properties of these forecasts and compare their ability to harness the wisdom of the crowd. In terms of location, the two average forecasts have the same mean. The average quantile forecast is always sharper: it has lower variance than the average probability forecast. Even when the average probability forecast is overconfident, the shape of the average quantile forecast still offers the possibility of a better forecast. Using probability forecasts for gross domestic product growth and inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we present evidence that both when the average probability forecast is overconfident and when it is underconfident, it is outperformed by the average quantile forecast. Our results show that averaging quantiles is a viable alternative and indicate some conditions under which it is likely to be more useful than averaging probabilities.

Our analysis suggests that this is not necessarily the case and that an inaccurate forecast can actually be more informative than an accurate one. Prior studies on analysts' deviations from management guidance focus on analysts' incentives to issue estimates that managers can beat.

Multiple equilibria can arise: more messages in aggregate induce more \u201cshouting to be heard,\u201d dissipating profit. Equilibria can involve a small range of loud shouters or large range of quiet whisperers. All advertisers prefer there to be less shouting. There is the largest diversity in message levels for a middling width of advertiser types: both very wide and very narrow widths have only one message per advertiser.

Thaler Should NFL teams trade for a top pick in the draft? There is so much financial pressure to make a good decision in the NFL draft; does that pressure create a decision-making bias among owners? The authors analyze the decision making of NFL teams during their annual player draft. They suggest that teams may overvalue the chance to pick early in the draft. Using archival data on draft-day trades, player performance, and compensation, the authors compare the market value of draft picks with the surplus value to teams provided by the drafted players. The insight for management: Consistent with psychological research, top draft picks are significantly overvalued in a manner that is inconsistent with efficient markets.Is Pay for Performance Detrimental to Innovation? (p. 1496) Florian Ederer, Gustavo Manso Should managers exploit or explore? Previous research in economics shows that compensation based on the pay-for-performance principle is effective in inducing higher levels of effort and productivity (exploiting existing competencies). On the other hand, research in psychology argues that performance-based financial incentives inhibit creativity and innovation (exploring new opportunities). How should managerial compensation be structured if the goal is to induce managers to pursue more innovative business strategies? In a controlled laboratory setting, the authors find evidence that the combination of tolerance for early failure and reward for long-term success is effective in motivating innovation. The authors also find that the threat of termination can undermine incentives for innovation, whereas golden parachutes can alleviate these innovation-reducing effects. The insight for management: Pushing employees on production can stifle creativity and long-run innovation.The Impact of Gender Diversity on the Performance of Business Teams: Evidence from a Field Experiment (p. 1514) Sander Hoogendoorn, Hessel Oosterbeek, Mirjam van Praag Can gender balance improve team performance? The authors estimate the impact of the share of women in business teams on the performance of undergraduate students in business studies who start up a venture as part of their curriculum. They intentionally manipulated the gender composition of teams and assigned students randomly to teams, conditional on their gender, and they find that teams with an equal gender mix perform better than male-dominated teams in terms of sales and profits. The authors look for an explanation for the mixed-gender team superior performance, including gender complementarities and differences in learning styles and conflict resolution, but they find no support for these reasons. The insight for management: There's no explaining why, but mixing the gender composition of teams might improve performance.Ethnic Innovation and U.S. Multinational Firm Activity (p. 1529) C. Fritz Foley, William R. Kerr What is the impact of ethnic innovators, and thus immigration, on U.S. innovation? Over the 1975\u20131982 period, 81.3% of the names on U.S. patent applications were of Anglo-Saxon origin, but by the 2000\u20132004 period, this share had fallen to 68.0%. Much of this shift, and in fact much of the recent growth in the number of U.S.-based scientists and engineers, is a consequence of immigration. In the 2000 Census of Populations, immigrants constituted 25% and 48% of the U.S. workforce employed in science and engineering occupations with bachelor's and doctorate educations, respectively. The authors find that increases in the share of a firm's innovation performed by inventors of a particular ethnicity are associated with increases in the share of that firm's affiliate activity in countries related to that ethnicity. Ethnic innovators also appear to facilitate the disintegration of innovative activity across borders and to allow U.S. multinationals to form new affiliates abroad without the support of local joint venture partners. The insight for management: Ethnic diversity of research teams may spur cross-border collaboration and increased innovation.Shouting to Be Heard in Advertising (p. 1545) Simon P. Anderson, Andr\u00e9 de Palma Does an ad\u2014any ad\u2014catch the attention of the consumer? We've gone from being exposed to approximately 500 ads per day in the 1970s to as many as 5,000 per day today. Advertising competes for scarce consumer attention, so more profitable advertisers send more messages to break through the others' clutter. A cycle results: More messages in aggregate induce more \u201cshouting to be heard,\u201d which hurts all advertisers' profits. All advertisers would prefer for there to be less shouting, but none can afford to not get its message out in a loud and crowded advertising environment. In a market of \u201cquiet whisperers,\u201d all advertisers are better off through lower required advertising effort to get their messages heard. Given this tendency, increasing the cost of sending messages can make all advertisers better off by reducing the shouting. The insight for management: Advertising in a crowded market costs all participants who are trying to make their message heard.Infrastructure Planning for Electric Vehicles with Battery Swapping (p. 1557) Ho-Yin Mak, Ying Rong, Zuo-Jun Max Shen The transportation sector holds the key to a greener environment, and there is a lot at stake. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in 2003, the transportation sector was accountable for 29.6% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. GHG emissions by transportation also grew the fastest among all economic sectors, accounting for 47% of the net increase in total emissions since 1990. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been proposed as a key technology to help cut down the massive GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Why aren't more EVs on the roads? Because of the limited capacity of batteries, typical EVs can travel for only approximately 100 miles on a single charge and require hours to be recharged. The industry has proposed a novel solution centered around the use of \u201cswapping stations,\u201d at which depleted batteries can be exchanged for recharged ones in the middle of long trips. The possible success of this solution hinges on the ability of the charging service provider to deploy a cost-effective infrastructure network, given only limited information regarding adoption rates. The authors develop optimization models that could aid the planning process for deploying a battery-swapping infrastructure. The insight for management: Analytical models can help estimate the potential impacts of battery standardization and technology advancements on the optimal infrastructure deployment strategy.Does Pooling Purchases Lead to Higher Profits? (p. 1576) Bin Hu, Izak Duenyas, Damian R. Beil Consider two buyers facing uncertain demands who need to purchase a common critical component from a powerful sole-source supplier. If the two buyers pool their demands and purchase from the supplier as a single entity, will they necessarily earn higher profits than they would if they purchased separately? The authors show that when a powerful supplier extracts profits from the buyers through optimal contract design, the demand variability reduction achieved by pooling can harm the buyers because it makes extracting profits easier for the supplier when pricing of the component is endogenous. The insight for management: Given a price, demand pooling is good for buyers, but if pricing is endogenous, demand pooling can be bad for buyers.Is It Better to Average Probabilities or Quantiles? (p. 1594) Kenneth C. Lichtendahl Jr., Yael Grushka-Cockayne, Robert L. Winkler The authors consider two ways to aggregate expert opinions using simple averages: averaging probabilities and averaging quantiles. They examine analytical properties of these forecasts and compare their ability to harness the wisdom of the crowd. In terms of location, the two average forecasts have the same mean. However, the average quantile forecast is always sharper: It has lower variance than the average probability forecast. Even when the average probability forecast is overconfident, the shape of the average quantile forecast still offers the possibility of a better forecast. The insight for management: Averaging quantiles is a viable alternative and under some conditions may be more useful than averaging probabilities.Product Market Competition, Managerial Compensation, and Firm Size in Market Equilibrium (p. 1612) Ajay Subramanian The author develops a model of competing firms in an industry to show how the distribution of firm qualities, moral hazard, and product market characteristics interact to affect firm size, managerial compensation, and market structure. He suggests that different determinants of product market competition have contrasting effects on firm size and managerial compensation. Although both firm size and managerial compensation increase with the entry cost, they increase with the elasticity of substitution if and only if firm size exceeds a high threshold but decrease if it is below a low threshold. The insight for management: Different determinants of competition indeed have contrasting effects.Guilt by Association: Strategic Failure Prevention and Recovery Capacity Investments (p. 1631) Sang-Hyun Kim, Brian Tomlin An ounce of prevention or a pound of cure? Should firms invest in failure prevention or recovery capacity? The authors examine technological systems that have unplanned outages with significant costs, a system outage if one or more of its subsystems fails, subsystem failures that occur simultaneously, and subsystem recovery that requires specific resources and capabilities that are provided by different firms. The authors find that, if recovery capacity investment is the only option, the firms in a decentralized setting overinvest in capacity, resulting in higher system availability but at a higher cost. They find that, if both investments can be made, the firms underinvest in failure prevention and overinvest in recovery capacity. The insight for management: Firms in a decentralized setting shift their focus from preventing failures to responding to failures, resulting in lower system availability.A Game-Theoretic Model of International Influenza Vaccination Coordination (p. 1650) Hamed Mamani, Stephen E. Chick, David Simchi-Levi According to the World Health Organization, influenza outbreaks cost between $1 million and $6 million per 100,000 inhabitants in industrialized countries yearly, and the World Bank forecasts economic losses between $2 trillion and $3 trillion in the event of a global pandemic. How can vaccinations be better administered to reduce these costs? A major challenge is the coordination of incentives of different purchasers of influenza vaccines across borders. Influenza vaccination decisions in one country can influence the size of an outbreak in other countries due to interdependent risks from infectious disease transmission. The authors propose a contract based on an epidemic model that accounts for intranational transmission and that from a source country where the dominant strain emerges. The contract reduces the overall financial burden of infection globally and improves the total number of people infected by seasonal influenza outbreaks. The insight for management: Analytical methods can prevent millions of influenza cases and save tens of millions of dollars.Entrepreneurs Under Uncertainty: An Economic Experiment in China (p. 1671) Hakan J. Holm, Sonja Opper, Victor Nee Are entrepreneurs more risk taking than non-entrepreneurs? The authors collect a sample of 700 chief executive officers from the Yangzi River Delta region in China and compare them to a control group of 200 members. Their findings suggest that, in economic decisions, entrepreneurs are more willing to accept strategic uncertainty related to multilateral competition and trust. However, entrepreneurs do not differ from ordinary people when it comes to nonstrategic forms of uncertainty, such as risk and ambiguity. The insight for management: Entrepreneurs are willing to accept more strategic uncertainty, but they react similarly to others when it comes to mitigating more tactical forms of risk.Do Analysts Sacrifice Forecast Accuracy for Informativeness? (p. 1688) Henock Louis, Amy X. Sun, Oktay Urcan Analysts deviate from management guidance to correct for perceived earnings management. Although the deviations reduce forecast accuracy, they improve forecast informativeness, bringing the forecasts closer to the unmanaged earnings and reducing accruals mispricing. Generally, one would think that more accurate analyst forecasts (i.e., estimates that are closer to the reported earnings) are better for investors and that analysts' objective is to forecast the reported (managed) earnings accurately. The authors suggest that this is not necessarily the case; an inaccurate forecast can actually be more informative than an accurate one. While it may be perceived that deviations from management guidance focus on analysts' incentives to issue estimates that managers can beat, this would assume that analysts side with management against the interests of their clients, and this is not always true. The insight for management: Analysts may deviate from management guidance to provide useful valuation information to their clients.Trade Promotion Decisions Under Demand Uncertainty: A Market Experiment Approach (p. 1709) Hong Yuan, Miguel I. G\u00f3mez, Vithala R. Rao In the United States, consumer packaged goods manufacturers increased their trade promotions to retailers more than fourfold (from $71 billion to $312 billion) between 1996 and 2004, and trade promotions grew to 18% of total sales by 2010. How should such trade promotions be structured? The authors examine trade promotion discounts offered either as off-invoices or as scan-backs. A manufacturer may offer \u201coff-invoices\u201d, retailer discount-based trade promotions, in which a per-case discount is given for all retailer purchases of a given brand during a limited period of time. Or a manufacturer may negotiate with \u201cscan-backs,\u201d retailer performance-based trade promotions, in which a discount per case is given after a prespecified level of retail sales performance (e.g., target sales volume per week) has been attained and verified by retail sales scanning data. The authors compare wholesale and retail prices, retailer order quantities, and profits given the same trade promotion discount. The authors find that scan-backs result in higher wholesale and retail prices and lower retailer order quantities. They find that, in expanding markets, manufacturers offer deeper discounts when trade promotions are allocated to off-invoices versus scan-backs. The insight for management: The choice of off-invoices or scan-backs results in different market price and quantity dynamics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1765","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['gender diversity', 'ethnic innovators', 'innovation', 'team performance']","The article discusses themes of gender diversity and ethnic innovation, which are indicative of moderate woke themes related to DEI and social impact within business contexts.

Consumers judiciously decide the number of firms to include in their consideration sets as well as how many products from those firms. This decision depends on the relative trade-offs of evaluating an additional product and whether it is from a firm already included in the consideration set or from an entirely new firm. The composition of consumers' consideration set affects how firms compete in prices and in the number of products to offer. Contrary to previous literature, we find that firm differentiation can reduce firms' product lines and within-firm evaluation costs have either a positive or a negative effect on firms' prices. Interestingly, we show that within-firm evaluation costs and across-firm evaluation costs are different constructs. The number of products firms offer in equilibrium can exceed the socially optimal level if within-firm evaluation costs are significant. This paper was accepted by J.

A number of laboratory experiments demonstrate that this assumption does not hold. Specifically, faced with uncertain demand, decision makers place orders that systematically deviate from the expected profit maximizing levels. We have added to this body of knowledge by demonstrating that ordering decisions also systematically depend on individual contract parameters and by developing a behavioral model that captures this systematic behavior. We proceed to test our behavioral model using laboratory experiments and use the data to derive empirical model parameters. We then test our approach in out-of-sample validation experiments that confirm that, indeed, contracts designed using the behavioral model perform better than contracts designed using the standard model.

In these models, the market is partitioned into a finite set of market segments. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of this class of models in the case where each product in the market is sold by a separate, independent firm. We identify a simple and very broadly satisfied condition under which a pure Nash equilibrium exists and the set of Nash equilibria coincides with the solutions of the system of first-order-condition equations, a property of essential importance to empirical studies. This condition specifies that in every market segment, each firm captures less than 50% of the potential customer population when pricing at a specific level that, under the condition, is an upper bound for a rational price choice for the firm irrespective of the competitors' prices. We show that under a somewhat stronger, but still broadly satisfied, version of the above condition, a unique equilibrium exists. We complete the picture by establishing the existence of a Nash equilibrium, indeed a unique Nash equilibrium, for markets with an arbitrary degree of concentration, under sufficiently tight price bounds. We discuss how our results extend to a continuum of customer types. A discussion of the multiproduct case is included.

These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice.

This paper derives a tractable quasi-hyperbolic discounting model of that behavioral tendency (for a queueing system in which service time is short relative to the time horizon for its benefits). Planning in advance, people may naively overestimate their self-control. This paper shows how customers' lack of self-control and naivete affect optimal pricing and scheduling. The welfare-maximizing usage fee and the revenue-maximizing usage fee decrease with customers' lack of self-control. Charging for subscription, in addition to or instead of per use, increases revenue, especially when subscribers are naive. If the manager can charge for subscription or per use, subscription is optimal for revenue maximization, whereas usage-based pricing is optimal for welfare maximization. If customers are heterogeneous in their self-control and naivete, priority scheduling can dramatically increase welfare and revenue.

Firms with more competitors pass customer vehicles at higher rates and are more likely to lose customers whom they fail, suggesting that competition intensifies pressure on facilities to provide illegal leniency.

Our methodology combines a novel data set with periodic information about the queuing system (collected via video recognition technology) with point-of-sales data. We find that waiting in queue has a nonlinear impact on purchase incidence and that customers appear to focus mostly on the length of the queue, without adjusting enough for the speed at which the line moves. An implication of this finding is that pooling multiple queues into a single queue may increase the length of the queue observed by customers and thereby lead to lower revenues. We also find that customers' sensitivity to waiting is heterogeneous and negatively correlated with price sensitivity, which has important implications for pricing in a multiproduct category subject to congestion effects.

We consider an airline's choices of quality and price as dynamic decisions that trade off current cash flows for future revenue.

We find that an airline's quality decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality.

For investors with particular risk preferences, further customization should thus provide additional value. The objective of this paper is to investigate the strength of preference for such customized distributions and to draw conclusions about the demand for personalized investment products. In two experimental studies, 256 participants could adjust the return distribution of an initially chosen B&H investment by using an interactive software program. Our main finding is that most investors make extensive use of the customization option and many are willing to pay a substantial fee for this additional flexibility. We further find that the willingness to pay for customization is lower if the fee is integrated into the display of the return distribution, making its impact on final returns more obvious. We also observe that investors can be clustered into distinct subgroups via their adjustment patterns, but individually elicited prospect theory parameters are barely able to explain and predict these adjustments. As a robustness check, we also survey real investors at an investors fair to compare their preferences with those of our main pool of student subjects. We find that the willingness to pay for customization is slightly lower for these real investors and the main effect of fee integration is also less pronounced. In summary, we observe a strong willingness to pay for additional flexibility even though the actual benefits of customization vary markedly according to the individual. In many cases the accepted fees are so high that standard B&H strategies stochastically dominate the customized distributions after fee integration.

Snyder, Michael W. Toffel When is a good thing a bad thing? Competitors who fight for customers may cut corners in order to get their business. Competition among firms yields many benefits but can also encourage firms to engage in corrupt or unethical activities. The authors suggest that competition can lead organizations to provide services that customers demand but that violate government regulations, especially when price competition is restricted. Using 28 million vehicle emissions tests from more than 11,000 facilities, the authors show that increased competition is associated with greater inspection leniency, a service quality attribute that customers value but that is illegal and socially costly. Firms with more competitors pass customer vehicles at higher rates and are more likely to lose customers whom they fail, suggesting that competition intensifies pressure on facilities to provide illegal leniency. The authors also show that, at least in markets in which pricing is restricted, firms use corrupt and unethical practices as an entry strategy. The insight for management: Highly competitive environments may create perverse incentives along legal and ethical lines.Measuring the Effect of Queues on Customer Purchases (p. 1743) Yina Lu, Andr\u00e9s Musalem, Marcelo Olivares, Ariel Schilkrut How does the size of queues affect sales? The authors conduct an empirical study to analyze how waiting in line in the context of a retail store affects customers' purchasing behavior. The authors collected data at a deli counter via video recognition technology over a period of nine months and cross-referenced it with with point-of-sales data. They find that waiting in line has an escalating effect on purchases; longer lines are dramatically more discouraging than shorter ones. Interestingly, customers appear to focus mostly on the length of the queue, without adjusting enough for the speed at which the line moves\u2014despite the fact that a single queue generally provides better service. An implication of this finding is that pooling multiple queues into a single queue may increase the length of the queue observed by customers and thereby lead to lower revenues, even though service is better. The authors also find that bargain-hunting customers are more willing to wait in lines; thus, the service strategy also has price implications. The insight for management: Those developing service strategies in services with queues must consider consumer psychology as well as operational efficiency.How Do Firm Financial Conditions Affect Product Quality and Pricing? (p. 1764) Gordon Phillips, Giorgo Sertsios The authors analyze the interaction of firm product quality and pricing decisions with financial distress and bankruptcy in the airline industry. They consider an airline's choices of quality and price as dynamic decisions that trade off current cash flows for future revenue. They examine how mishandled baggage, on-time performance, and pricing are related to financial distress and bankruptcy, controlling for the endogeneity of financial distress and bankruptcy. They find that an airline's quality decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality. In contrast, during bankruptcy product quality increases relative to financial distress. In addition, the authors find that firms price more aggressively when in financial distress consistent with firms' trying to increase short-term market share and revenues. The insight for management: A firm's financial conditions may directly affect the quality and pricing of its services.The Emergence of Opinion Leaders in a Networked Online Community: A Dyadic Model with Time Dynamics and a Heuristic for Fast Estimation (p. 1783) Yingda Lu, Kinshuk Jerath, Param Vir Singh Online ratings, rankings, and reviews are prevalent on many retail sites. Do different opinions carry more or less weight with prospective buyers? The authors study the drivers of the emergence of \u201copinion leaders\u201d in a networked community where users establish links to others, indicating their \u201ctrust\u201d for the link receiver's opinion. This leads to the formation of a network, with some individuals becoming the opinion leaders. The authors find that, in the Epinions network, both the widely studied \u201cpreferential attachment\u201d effect based on the existing number of links to an opinion giver and the number and quality of reviews written are significant drivers of new incoming trust links to a reviewer. However, over time the influence of the opinion leaders fades. The insight for management: The design of online review communities should consider the important influence of quality and quantity of opinions provided by opinion leaders.Designing Buyback Contracts for Irrational But Predictable Newsvendors (p. 1800) Michael Becker-Peth, Elena Katok, Ulrich W. Thonemann In the face of uncertainty, are supply chain managers rational? One of the main assumptions in research on designing supply contracts is that decision makers act in a way that maximizes their expected profit. The authors conduct a number of laboratory experiments that demonstrate that this assumption does not hold. Specifically, faced with uncertain demand, decision makers place orders that systematically deviate from the expected profit-maximizing levels. The insight for management: One must account for tastes; a behavioral model better explains contracting outcomes than contracts designed using the standard rational optimization model.Price Competition Under Mixed Multinomial Logit Demand Functions (p. 1817) Margaret Aksoy-Pierson, Gad Allon, Awi Federgruen How do competitive markets perform when customers can be segmented? The authors estimate the performance of a market that is partitioned into a finite set of market segments. They characterize the equilibrium behavior of this class of market models. The insight for management: Modeling approaches can lead to a better understanding of the performance in equilibrium conditions of segmented markets.Alleviating the Patient's Price of Privacy Through a Partially Observable Waiting List (p. 1836) Burhaneddin Sand\u0131k\u00e7\u0131, Lisa M. Maillart, Andrew J. Schaefer, Mark S. Roberts What is the price of patient privacy in the case of a liver donation waiting list? In the United States, end-stage liver disease patients join a waiting list and then make accept/reject decisions for transplantation as deceased-donor organs are offered to them over time. These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, publishes only an aggregated version of the waiting list. It is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. The authors compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results with perfect and imperfect information. They assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy, measured in the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information. The insight for management: The currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice.What Are Investors Willing to Pay to Customize Their Investment Product? (p. 1855) Dennis Vrecko, Thomas Langer Even though buy-and-hold (B&H) investment strategies can take the risk tolerance of an investor into account by specifying a suitable stock proportion, the outcome profiles of B&H strategies are restricted to a specific class of return distributions. For investors with particular risk preferences, further customization should thus provide additional value. The authors investigate the strength of preference for such customized distributions and draw conclusions about the demand for personalized investment products. In two experimental studies, 256 participants could adjust the return distribution of an initially chosen B&H investment by using an interactive software program. The authors also surveyed real investors at an investors fair to compare their preferences with those of the main pool of student subjects. The insight for management: Most investors make extensive use of the customization option, and many are willing to pay a substantial fee for this additional flexibility.Consideration Set Formation with Multiproduct Firms: The Case of Within-Firm and Across-Firm Evaluation Costs (p. 1871) Lin Liu, Anthony Dukes How many firms and how many products should be considered in evaluating potential suppliers? The authors evaluate a situation in which firms carry multiple products and consumers incur evaluation costs not only across firms but also within firms. Consumers judiciously decide the number of firms to include in their consideration sets as well as how many products from those firms. This decision depends on the relative trade-offs of evaluating an additional product and whether it is from a firm already included in the consideration set or from an entirely new firm. The composition of consumers' consideration set affects how firms compete in prices and in the number of products to offer. The authors find that firm differentiation can reduce firms' product lines and that within-firm evaluation costs have either a positive or a negative effect on firms' prices. The insight for management: Within-firm evaluation costs and across-firm evaluation costs are different constructs; the number of products that firms offer in equilibrium can exceed the socially optimal level if within-firm evaluation costs are significant.Do Hedge Funds Outperform Stocks and Bonds? (p. 1887) Turan G. Bali, Stephen J. Brown, K. Ozgur Demirtas Hedge funds' extensive use of derivatives, short selling, and leverage and their dynamic trading strategies create significant nonnormalities in their return distributions. Hence, the traditional performance measures fail to provide an accurate characterization of the relative strength of hedge fund portfolios. The authors set out to determine which hedge fund strategies outperform the U.S. equity and/or bond markets. The insight for management: The long/short equity hedge and emerging markets hedge fund strategies outperform the U.S. equity market, and the long/short equity hedge, multistrategy, managed futures, and global macro hedge fund strategies dominate the U.S. Treasury market.Mixed Bundling in Two-Sided Markets in the Presence of Installed Base Effects (p. 1904) Yong Chao, Timothy Derdenger How does bundling affect prices in a market where there is an established installed base, such as video games? The authors determine that mixed bundling causes prices to fall on both sides of the market. They find that mixed bundling acts as a price discrimination tool segmenting the market more efficiently. Interestingly, as a by-product of this price discrimination, the two sides are better coordinated, and social welfare is enhanced. The authors test these theoretical predictions in the video game console market. The insight for management: Bundling and price discrimination has market efficiency creating potential in two-sided markets with an installed base.Implications of Hyperbolic Discounting for Optimal Pricing and Scheduling of Unpleasant Services That Generate Future Benefits (p. 1927) Erica L. Plambeck, Qiong Wang Why do so many people have gym memberships that they never use? People tend to lack the self-control to undergo an unpleasant service that would generate future benefits; no pain, but no gain. Planning in advance, people may naively overestimate their self-control and join the gym with all good intentions. How does such behavior affect optimal pricing? The authors show that the welfare-maximizing usage fee and the revenue-maximizing usage fee decrease with customers' lack of self-control. Charging for a subscription, in addition to or instead of per-use fees, increases revenue, especially when subscribers are naive. If customers are heterogeneous in their self-control and naivet\u00e9, priority scheduling can dramatically increase welfare and revenue. The insight for management: Optimally, gym memberships (and the like) are inexpensive because they are sold to people who underuse them.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1791","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['corruption', 'unethical', 'competition', 'socially costly']","The article discusses how competition can lead to unethical practices, highlighting themes of corruption and social costs, but it primarily focuses on business practices rather than a strong social justice or equity framework."],["2013","59","9","Gregory A.

We present a method for reducing the system to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials. Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product.

This setting has previously been considered analytically intractable. By deriving component good prices as exact algebraic functions of the optimal bundle price, I reduce the multiproduct pricing problem to a univariate nonlinear optimization problem in the bundle price. When the two component goods are sufficiently asymmetric in valuations, the optimal solution is partial mixed bundling (one component good is not sold separately), for which I derive exact conditions and optimal prices. An exact analytical solution is also given for mixed bundling of two information goods (component goods with zero marginal costs). For the general case, I derive a closed-form approximation of the optimal bundle price: pB = 0.5724w1 + 0.5695w2 + 0.3516a1 + 0.4889a2 + 0.0054(a2/a1)w1\u22120.0201(a2/a1)w2. The approximation is highly accurate (the resulting profit is within a percent of the exact optimal profit), efficient (instant solutions for specific problem instances), and useful in other applications where mixed bundling is a subproblem. I demonstrate this by applying the solution to the mixed bundle problem in a vertical channel where a retailer must bundle and price component goods from multiple independent manufacturers.

Bidding fees are the primary source of revenue for the seller but produce the same expected revenue as standard auctions (assuming risk-neutral bidders). If risk-loving preferences are incorporated in the model, expected revenue increases. Our model predicts a particular distribution of ending prices, which we test against observed auction data. The degree of fit depends on how unobserved parameters are chosen; in particular, a slight preference for risk has the biggest impact in explaining auction behavior, suggesting that pay-to-bid auctions are a mild form of gambling.

This relation between MBE and plan sales is more pronounced for the plan sales of chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) and is nonexistent for other key insiders. The market reactions to firms that successfully meet or beat expectations are relatively positive compared with their peers that fail to do so. One interpretation of our results is that CEOs and CFOs who sell under these plans may be more likely to engage in strategic behavior to meet or beat expectations in an effort to maximize their proceeds from plan sales. However, readers should exercise caution in making inferences, because the potential presence of limit order transactions makes it difficult to unambiguously determine the direction of causality of the relation we document.

We theoretically incorporate dividend volatility clustering into a model in which narrow-framing investors are loss averse over fluctuations in the value of their investments. Our model shows that dividend volatility positively predicts future asset returns, with the predictive power increasing with the forecasting horizon; our model also sheds light on a variety of other asset-pricing phenomena. We further provide supporting empirical evidence that dividend volatility is indeed priced in the data. More specifically, aggregate dividend volatility predicts and is predicted by aggregate price-to-dividend ratios; aggregate dividend volatility predicts future aggregate market returns; and dividend volatility of portfolios sorted by size, book-to-market ratios, and past returns predicts future portfolio-level returns, respectively.

In a setting where either the forward contracts are binding quantity commitments between buyers and suppliers or the forward production takes place before the uncertainty in demand is resolved, we find that a combination of factors that include market concentration, demand risk, and price elasticity of demand will determine whether a commodity will be sold mainly through forward contracts or in the spot market. Previous findings in the literature show that when participants are risk neutral, the ratio of forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone; also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. These findings hold under the assumption that demand is either deterministic or, if demand is uncertain, all production takes place after uncertainty is fully resolved and production plans can be altered instantaneously and costlessly. In our setting, however, we find that even a low level of demand risk can reverse the nature of supply in a highly competitive (low concentration) market, by shifting it from predominantly forward-driven to predominantly spot-driven supply.

Evidence from Retail Banking","We study customers' adoption and subsequent switching decisions with regard to a menu of three-part tariff plans offered by a commercial bank. Using a rich panel data set covering 70,510 fee-based checking accounts over 30 months, before and after the introduction of the plans, we find that most customers adopt non-cost-minimizing plans, preferring plans with large monthly allowances and high fixed payments. Furthermore, after adoption, customers who exceed their allowances and consequently pay overage fees are more likely to switch to plans with larger allowances than customers who do not experience such fees. Notably, after switching, these overage-paying customers pay higher monthly payments than before. In contrast, switching customers who did not pay overage payments before switching pay less after switching. Our findings, unlike those of previous research on experience-based learning, suggest that the behavior of experienced customers does not converge to the predictions of neoclassical models.

A common way to obtain such judgments is to assess fractiles or confidence intervals. However, these judgments tend to be systematically overconfident. Further, it has proved particularly difficult to debias such forecasts and improve the calibration. This paper proposes a simple process that systematically leads to wider confidence intervals, thus reducing overconfidence. With a series of experiments, including with professionals, we show that unpacking the distal future into intermediate more proximal futures systematically improves calibration. We refer to this phenomenon as the time unpacking effect, find it is robust to different elicitation formats, and address the possible reasons behind it. We further show that this results in better overall forecasting performance when improved calibration is traded off against less sharpness, and that substantive benefits can be obtained even from just one level of time unpacking.

Major channel structure decisions, although made infrequently, represent important strategic moves. For example, Gateway, a major U.S. personal computer (PC) maker, closed all 188 of its retail stores in 2004 while keeping its Internet channel open. Subsequently, Gateway PCs were made available at third-party retail stores such as Best Buy and Costco, which also carried competing PC brands. In 2006, Apple made a major expansion of its retail efforts by selling its MacBook computers through Best Buy stores throughout the United States, going beyond its own retail and online stores. In 2009, both General Motors and Chrysler closed more than one-third of their dealerships in the United States. In doing so they greatly reduced their distribution coverage, but they also reduced the inter- and intrabrand competition among the dealers. The insight for management: Complex but important strategic supply chain issues can be addressed with mathematical modeling.Unpacking the Future: A Nudge Toward Wider Subjective Confidence Intervals (p. 1970) Kriti Jain, Kanchan Mukherjee, J. Neil Bearden, Anil Gaba How well can managers gauge the likelihood of future events? For example, experts are often called upon to forecast the price of oil or the level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) at a future point in time, and they use their subjective judgment. However, predictions in such situations tend to be systematically overconfident. The authors of this paper propose a simple process that systematically leads to wider confidence intervals, thus reducing overconfidence. With a series of experiments, including with professionals, they show that \u201cunpacking\u201d the distant future into numerous intermediate more near-term futures systematically improves calibration. In other words, in subjective predictions, a three-month (packed) forecast for the DJIA has a significantly wider confidence interval than one based on one-, two-, and three-month forecasts (unpacked). The insight for management: Take one step at a time; subjective forecasts are more accurate if broken down into successive short-term forecasts.Insiders' Sales Under Rule 10b5-1 Plans and Meeting or Beating Earnings Expectations (p. 1988) John Shon, Stanley Veliotis How do insider stock sales affect a firm's ability to meet analyst expectations? The authors find that firms with insider sales executed under Rule 10b5-1 plans exhibit a higher likelihood of meeting or beating analysts' earnings expectations (MBE). Interestingly, this relation between MBE and plan sales is more pronounced for the plan sales of CEOs and CFOs and is nonexistent for other key insiders. The market reactions to firms that successfully meet or beat expectations are relatively positive compared with their peers that fail to do so. One interpretation of the results is that CEOs and CFOs who sell under these plans may be more likely to engage in strategic behavior to meet or beat expectations in an effort to maximize their proceeds from plan sales. However, readers should exercise caution in making inferences, because the potential presence of limit order transactions makes it difficult to unambiguously determine the direction of causality of the relation that we document. The insight for management: Watch the insiders; CEO and CFO stock sales activity is an indicator of future firm performance.Organization and Bargaining: Sales Process Choice at Auto Dealerships (p. 2003) Victor Manuel Bennett How does the sales process during a car purchase affect the transacted price? Negotiated prices are one factor determining whether a vendor or customer captures the value from a transaction. Auto dealerships that systematically negotiate more effectively capture more value. The author examines one dimension of the sales process: whether salespeople handle the entire sale in parallel or customers begin with less experienced salespeople who can escalate difficult assignments. The author uses data from transaction-level data on new car purchases in the United States and a unique survey of dealership management practices to find that a serial process has implications consistent with improving firms' bargaining power and reducing customers' outside options. The insight for management: Designing a serial negotiation process can increase transaction price and close more deals.Do Customers Learn from Experience? Evidence from Retail Banking (p. 2019) Itai Ater Vardit Landsman Do customers learn from experience? The authors study customers' adoption and subsequent switching decisions with regard to a menu of three-part tariff plans offered by a commercial bank. Using a data set of more than 70,000 fee-based checking accounts over 30 months, before and after the introduction of the plans, the authors find that most customers adopt non-cost-minimizing plans, preferring plans with large monthly allowances and high fixed payments. Furthermore, after adoption, customers who exceed their allowances and consequently pay overage fees are more likely to switch to plans with larger allowances than customers who do not experience such fees. Notably, after switching, these overage-paying customers pay higher monthly payments than before. In contrast, switching customers who did not pay overage payments before switching pay less after switching. The authors propose that \u201coverage aversion,\u201d or the fear of conducting more transactions than are covered and thus paying a per-transaction fee, is the most plausible explanation for their findings. The insight for management: Banking customers may have a preference for fixed-fee plans that generate more revenue per customer.Asset-Pricing Implications of Dividend Volatility (p. 2036) Yan Li, Liyan Yang How does dividend volatility affect asset pricing? The authors establish dividend volatility as a fundamental risk metric that prices assets. They show that dividend volatility positively predicts future asset returns, with the predictive power increasing with the forecasting horizon. They provide supporting empirical evidence that dividend volatility is indeed priced in the data. The insight for management: Dividend volatility affects asset pricing.Geographic Constraints on Knowledge Spillovers: Political Borders vs. Spatial Proximity (p. 2056) Jasjit Singh, Matt Marx Is geographic proximity a contributor to knowledge diffusion? Pockets of expertise such as Silicon Valley in California would suggest that pockets of knowledge and expertise tend to collocate geographically. But why not eastern Arizona or southern Oregon? Most prior work has typically examined this phenomenon considering only one geographic unit\u2014country, state, or metropolitan area\u2014at a time and has rarely accounted for spatial distance. These authors find that both country and state borders have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter within-region distances can explain. The puzzling state border effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only remained robust but even strengthened over time. The insight for management: Political borders matter. Distance alone does not capture geographical colocation; national borders and\u2014to a lesser degree\u2014state borders act as knowledge spillover inhibitors.Inventory Management for an Assembly System Subject to Supply Disruptions (p. 2079) Gregory A. DeCroix What is the optimal on-hand inventory to carry if a company's suppliers are subject to disruption? In an assembly system with a single end product and a general assembly structure, the system can be reduced to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies to allow for a heuristic policy for solving the ordering problem. The author finds, surprisingly, that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. The author also finds that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than for one with a longer lead time. Finally, the author finds that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product. The insight for management: Inventory ordering policies for assembly system supply chains with disruptions can lead to revised supply chain management strategies.Price-Quoting Strategies of an Upstream Supplier (p. 2093) Bin Hu, Damian R. Beil, Izak Duenyas How should a supplier price its quotes? The authors study an upstream supplier who quotes prices for a key component to multiple sellers that compete for an end-buyer's indivisible contract. In the case where at most one of the supplier's quotes may result in downstream contracting and hence produce supplier revenue, the authors show that the supplier will use one of two possible types of strategies, with the choice depending on the sellers' profit potentials relative to their uncertainties: secure, whereby the supplier will always have business; or risky, whereby the supplier may not have business. Addressing potential fairness concerns, the authors also study price-quoting strategies in which all sellers receive equal quotes. They show that the supplier's optimal mechanism resembles auctioning a single quote among the sellers. The insight for management: Careful analysis can assist upstream suppliers in their pricing decisions and provide general insights into multitier supply chains' pricing dynamics.Contract Design with a Dominant Retailer and a Competitive Fringe (p. 2111) Sreya Kolay, Greg Shaffer Which contract design is more appropriate for supply chain coordination: quantity discounts or two-part tariffs? The authors show that they are equivalent as mechanisms for channel coordination when an upstream firm sells its product in a downstream market that is characterized by a dominant retailer and a competitive fringe. They find that the upstream firm's profit in both settings is independent of whether quantity discounts or two-part tariffs are used. The insight for management: The firm's choice of contract design may turn on which one is easier to implement.The Role of Risk Preferences in Pay-to-Bid Auctions (p. 2117) Brennan C. Platt, Joseph Price, Henry Tappen How do risk preferences affect outcomes in pay-to-bid auctions? In pay-to-bid auctions, bidders pay a fee each time they increase the auction price. Bidding fees are the primary source of revenue for the seller, but they produce the same expected revenue as standard auctions (assuming risk-neutral bidders). If risk-loving preferences are incorporated in the model, expected revenue increases. The insight for management: Pay-to-bid auctions are a mild form of gambling.Demand Uncertainty and Excess Supply in Commodity Contracting (p. 2135) Dana G. Popescu, Sridhar Seshadri How do different characteristics of product demand and market impact the relative sales volume in the forward and spot markets for a commodity whose aggregate demand is uncertain? In a setting where either the forward contracts are binding quantity commitments between buyers and suppliers or the forward production takes place before the uncertainty in demand is resolved, the authors find that a combination of factors that include market concentration, demand risk, and price elasticity of demand will determine whether a commodity will be sold mainly through forward contracts or in the spot market. Generally, when participants are risk neutral, researchers believe that the ratio of forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone; also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. The authors find that in some cases, however, even a low level of demand risk can reverse the nature of supply in a highly competitive (low-concentration) market, by shifting it from predominantly forward-driven to predominantly spot-driven supply. In markets with high concentration, the price elasticity of demand will determine whether the supply will be predominantly spot-driven or forward-driven. The insight for management: New hypotheses on the structure of supply in commodity markets are being developed.Is There One Unifying Concept of Utility? An Experimental Comparison of Utility Under Risk and Utility Over Time (p. 2153) Mohammed Abdellaoui, Han Bleichrodt, Olivier l'Haridon, Corina Paraschiv Is happiness absolute, or relative and fleeting? The nature of utility (happiness) is controversial. Whereas decision theory commonly assumes that utility is context specific, applied and empirical decision analysis typically assumes one unifying concept of utility applicable to all decision problems. This controversy has hardly been addressed empirically because of the absence of methods to measure utility outside the context of risk. The authors introduce a method to measure utility over time and compare utility under risk and utility over time. They distinguish between gains and losses and also measure loss aversion.

Delegation tends to outperform control when (1) the manufacturer is uncertain about the tier 1 supplier's cost and believes that it is likely to be high; (2) the manufacturer and the tier 1 supplier know the tier 2 supplier's cost or at least that it will be high; (3) the manufacturer has an alternative to engaging the tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers, such as in-house production; and (4) the firms use price-only contracts as opposed to quantity discount contracts.

By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer price guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season.

Postponement, component commonality, and resource flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our central research question is the following: What are the minimum inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always strictly positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers with perfectly positively correlated demands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0399","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When forecasts are private information, there are at most two equilibria: a complete coordination failure or a monotone equilibrium. The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally.

In this paper, we study a joint implementation of price- and capacity-based substitution mechanisms to alleviate the level of such inventory disparities. We consider a firm producing substitutable products via a capacity portfolio consisting of both product-dedicated and flexible resources and characterize the structure of the optimal production and pricing decisions. We then explore how changes in various problem parameters affect the optimal policy structure. We show that the availability of a flexible resource helps maintain stable price differences across products over time even though the price of each product may fluctuate over time. This result has favorable ramifications from a marketing standpoint because it suggests that even when a firm applies a dynamic pricing strategy, it may still establish consistent price positioning among multiple products if it can employ a flexible replenishment resource. We provide numerical examples for the price stabilization effect and discuss extensions of our results to a more general multiple product setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0404","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

With the CBS policy, the number of working servers is dynamically adjusted according to the queue length. Besides lining up for free service, customers have the option of paying a fee and getting faster service. Customers' equilibrium behavior is studied under two information scenarios: In the no information scenario, customers only know the long-term statistics, such as the expected waiting time; in the partial information scenario, customers observe the number of working servers and understand the staffing policy upon their arrival. Unlike a queueing system with a constant staffing level, a positive externality is associated with customers' joining the CBS system. Both avoid-the-crowd and follow-the-crowd customer behaviors are possible, and multiple equilibria could exist. We develop the stationary performance measures of the system by considering the customers' strategic behavior. Numerical analysis shows that information can either hurt or improve the performance of the system, depending on the staffing and pricing policy. Another important conclusion is that the system performance is more robust to setting a relatively high than a relatively low price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0406","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing behavior and system performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2013","15","1","Amar SapraAmar Sapraamar@iimb.ernet.inIndian Institute of Management Bangalore, Bangalore 560076, IndiaSearch for more papers by this author, Peter L.

The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0409","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain market behavior and capacity pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These models predict that inventories carried by a retailer should be a function of the product variety carried by the retailer, distribution system characteristics, economies of scale, etc. A few recent empirical studies have explored the impact of some of these factors on aggregate inventories at U.S. retailers. Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U.S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels. Increased demand fluctuations are also associated with higher inventories, although the effects are less robust. The significant variables together with retailer segment identifiers explain a substantial fraction of the variance in inventory levels and can be potentially useful to managers in benchmarking their inventory levels.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0407","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To care for additional patients, hospitals without burn centers will be used to stabilize patients until burn beds become available. In this work, we develop a new system for prioritizing patients for transfer to burn beds as they become available and demonstrate its superiority over several other triage methods. Based on data from previous burn catastrophes, we study the feasibility of being able to admit 400 patients to burn beds within the critical three- to five-day time frame.

Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability.

The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers. We show that the mechanisms can be efficiently computed and highlight the impact of the improved sharing of surface water. We also study the movement of the price of water with its scarcity.

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0416","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of gray markets and distribution channels without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental\u2014the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental\u2014the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0423","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of selling strategies in supply chains without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level. The agent earns zero rent in the additive effort case but may earn a positive rent in the multiplicative effort case. Finally, our numerical analysis shows that demand censorship can have a significant negative impact on the value of contracting with the sales agent, especially when the sales margin is low and the market uncertainty is high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0424","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of salesforce contracting and demand censorship without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered load analysis looks at the amount of capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems. Given the distribution of the stochastic offered load, we often can set staffing levels to stabilize performance at target levels, even in face of a strongly time-varying arrival rate, long service times, and network structure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0428","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for staffing levels in service systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2013","15","2","J\u00e9r\u00e9mie GallienJ\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gallienjgallien@london.eduLondon Business School, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author, Alan Scheller-WolfAlan Scheller-Wolfawolf@andrew.cmu.eduTepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213Search for more papers by this author","Call for Papers\u2014Proposal for an M&SOM Special Issue on Practice-Focused Research","Co-Editors of the Special Issue:  J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gallien, London Business School,  Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom; and Alan Scheller-Wolf, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University,  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0436","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article is a call for papers focused on practice-oriented research without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns, indicating a purely technical and academic focus."],["2013","15","2","","2012 M&SOM Meritorious Service Award","Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM) depends on the volunteer work of many professionals who take the time to provide careful and constructive reviews of the manuscripts submitted to the journal.

We assume consumer-driven, dynamic, stockout-based substitution and random proportions of each type. No efficient method to obtain the optimal solution for this problem is known to our knowledge. However, if the number of customers of each type is a fixed proportion of demand, there exists an efficient algorithm for solving for the optimal assortment. We show that the fixed proportions model gives an upper bound to the optimal expected profit for the random proportions model. This bound allows us to obtain a measure of the absolute performance of heuristic solutions. We also provide a bound for the component-wise absolute difference in expected sales between the two models, which is asymptotically tight as the inventory vector is made large, while keeping the number of products fixed. This result provides us with a lower bound to the optimal expected profit and a performance guarantee for the fixed proportions solution in the random proportions model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0425","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand modeling and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We test the model on both simulated sales data and Intel's high-end desktop processor sales data. We use two alternative specifications for product strength in this market: performance and performance/price ratio. The former demonstrates better fit and forecast accuracy, likely due to the low price sensitivity of this high-end market. In addition, the parameter estimate suggests that, for the innovators in the diffusion of product adoption, brand switchings are more strongly influenced by product strength than within-brand product upgrades in this market. Our results indicate that compared with the Bass model, Norton\u2013Bass model, and Jun\u2013Park choice-based diffusion model, our approach is a better fit for strategic forecasting that occurs many months or years before the actual product launch.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0430","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for forecasting product demand without addressing any social issues, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2013","15","3","Jing-Sheng SongJing-Sheng Songjssong@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author, Paul ZipkinPaul Zipkinzipkin@duke.eduFuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708Search for more papers by this author","Supply Streams","A supply stream is a continuous version of a supply chain. It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0431","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We view products as collections of components linked together to work as an integrated whole. Previous work has established modularity (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and cyclicality (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components). We find cyclicality to be a determinant of quality that is distinct from, and no less important than, modularity. Extending this main result, we show how the cyclicality\u2013quality relationship is affected by the centrality of a component in a cycle and the distribution of a cycle across product modules.

The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firm's cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal. Moreover, we find that hedging may lead to inventory reduction in multiperiod problems. Thus the insights from the single-period studies in the literature\u2014hedging leads to inventory increase\u2014do not apply.

However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0434","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under \u03b1-contracts, a fixed fraction \u03b1 of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity. Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity. Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDM's expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection. Our analysis offers supporting rationale for the coexistence of \u03b1-contracts and reservation contracts in practice and provides insights on horizontal capacity coordination beyond the semiconductor industry.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0435","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract types and risk management in the semiconductor industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2013","15","3","Kamalini RamdasKamalini Ramdaskramdas@london.eduManagement Science and Operations, London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author, Jonathan WilliamsJonathan Williamsjonwms@uga.eduDepartment of Economics, Terry College of Business, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602Search for more papers by this author, Marc LipsonMarc Lipsonmlipson@virginia.eduDarden School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903Search for more papers by this author","Can Financial Markets Inform Operational Improvement Efforts?

First, we develop a novel problem formulation and solution method that combines the achievable region approach with mechanism design. This approach extends to menu design problems for other systems. Second, the work conserving c\u03bc priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A strategic delay policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies. Third, we identify general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal strategic delay: a price, a lead-time, and a segment-size condition. We translate these into demand and capacity parameter conditions for cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous valuations for each type.

This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firm's development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and considering the product's environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement. However, we also find that accelerated obsolescence, under some conditions, can actually make modular upgradability greener.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0396","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['environmental performance', 'green design', 'sustainability']","The article discusses environmental performance and sustainability, which are moderate indicators of woke themes, particularly in the context of operations management.

We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations. We find evidence that these factors also influence the comprehensiveness of the information suppliers share and their willingness to share the information publicly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1120.0420","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['climate change', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'sustainability', 'vulnerability']","The article addresses climate change and sustainability within supply chains, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and environmental ethics.

We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0437","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['recycling', 'sustainable', 'localization', 'operations strategy']","The article discusses sustainable operations strategies and the importance of recycling, which aligns with socially progressive themes related to environmental sustainability.

These more sustainable technologies typically require a higher up-front investment but have lower operating (fuel or energy) costs. What complicates this decision is the fact that the projected dollar savings from the more sustainable technologies fluctuate considerably due to uncertainty in fuel prices, and the total capacity may not be utilized at 100% because of fluctuations in the demand for the product. We consider the firm's capacity adjustments over time given a portfolio of technology options when the demand and the fuel costs are stochastic and possibly dependent. Our model also allows for usage-based capacity deterioration. We provide the analytical structure of the optimal policy, which assigns different control limits for investing, staying put, and disinvesting in the capacities of the competing technology choices for each realization of demand and fuel costs at each period.

We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17% from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms.

Specifically, we determine under what market and regulatory conditions an NGO should target the industry versus the regulatory body to influence firms to replace the substance. We examine how the NGO's strategy changes as the NGO's pragmatism (i.e., the extent to which the NGO incorporates firms' profits into its decision making) increases. Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry and the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGO's activism. We show that the potential for a firm to lobby can benefit consumers by motivating the NGO to exert more effort and increase the market sensitivity to a substance, thereby forcing the firm to replace.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0440","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['hazardous substance', 'NGO', 'influence', 'regulatory body', 'consumers']","The article discusses the role of NGOs in influencing firms to replace hazardous substances, reflecting a moderate focus on social responsibility and consumer safety.

Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics- and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0443","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['carbon footprinting', 'emissions', 'sustainability', 'social planner', 'carbon tax']","The article discusses carbon footprinting and its implications for greenhouse gas emissions, which aligns with sustainability themes.

Variability in those prices has implications for how much a manufacturer should invest in three fundamental types of process improvement. Input price variability reduces the value of improving input efficiency (output produced per unit input) but increases that of capacity efficiency (the rate at which a production facility can convert input into output). Output price variability increases the value of capacity efficiency, but it increases the value of input efficiency if and only if the expected margin is small. Moreover, as the expected input cost rises, the value of input efficiency decreases. A third type of process improvement is to develop flexibility in input efficiency versus capacity efficiency (the ability to respond to a rise in input cost or fall in output price by increasing input-efficiency at the expense of capacity efficiency). The value of this flexibility decreases with variability in input and output prices if and only if the expected margin is thin. Together, these results suggest that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system may reduce investment by basic material manufacturers in improving energy efficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2013.0444","","MSOM","Operations Management","4","['carbon tax', 'energy efficiency', 'process improvement']","The article discusses the implications of a carbon tax and energy efficiency, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and environmental ethics.

We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation.

Our approach advocates that the key to identifying new business models is understanding the context of decision making in existing models and the associated inefficiencies. We propose a three-step approach: First, existing business models must be audited for identifying information and incentive misalignment inefficiencies that destroy value. Next, new business models can be identified by changing the context of the decision associated with the most consequential of these inefficiencies. We conjecture that four elements of the decision context are most significant: WHAT decisions are made, WHEN they are made, WHO makes them, and WHY they are made. We provide a set of idea triggers to stimulate brainstorming of new business models by changing one of these four Ws. Finally, we advise that generated business models should be analyzed and experimented with to identify the most promising ones.

This is significant because major problems in clustering, partitioning, and imaging can be presented as the Rayleigh ratio minimization on discrete variables and an orthogonality constraint. These challenging problems are modeled as the normalized cut problem, the graph expander ratio problem, the Cheeger constant problem, or the conductance problem, all of which are NP-hard. These problems have traditionally been solved, heuristically, using the \u201cspectral technique.\u201d A unified framework is provided here whereby all these problems are formulated as a constrained minimization form of a quadratic ratio, referred to here as the Rayleigh ratio. The quadratic ratio is to be minimized on discrete variables and a single sum constraint that we call the balance or orthogonality constraint. When the discreteness constraints on the variables are disregarded, the resulting continuous relaxation is solved by the spectral method. It is shown here that the Rayleigh ratio minimization subject to the discreteness constraints requiring each variable to assume one of two values in {\u2212b,1} is solvable in strongly polynomial time, equivalent to a single minimum s,t cut algorithm on a graph of same size as the input graph, for any nonnegative value of b. This discrete form for the Rayleigh ratio problem was often assumed to be NP-hard. Not only is it shown here that the discrete Rayleigh ratio problem is polynomial time solvable, but also the algorithm is more efficient than the spectral algorithm. Furthermore, an experimental study demonstrates that the new algorithm provides in practice an improvement, often dramatic, on the quality of the results of the spectral method, both in terms of approximating the true optimum of the Rayleigh ratio problem on both the discrete variables and the balance constraint, and in terms of the subjective partition quality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1126","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm related to optimization problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Computational experiments demonstrate that our rollout policies improve upon the performance of a rolling horizon procedure and commonly employed fixed-route policies, with improvement over the latter being more substantial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1127","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical solutions to a mathematical problem in vehicle routing without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

While making different types of decisions (at operational, tactical, and strategic levels), managers are increasingly relying on information gleaned from various databases, data warehouses, and data streams feeding them. The quality of organizational decisions, therefore, often depends on the quality of the information derived from these databases and data streams, and a manager is able to make better use of the information if she also understands the quality level of that information. Previous research has examined how the quality level of a database query output can be estimated based on the quality level of the input data. In this research, we generalize this stream of research and allow a query to have general selection conditions involving multiple attributes with any combination of conjunction or disjunction of subconditions that may include functions of multiple attributes.

These dynamic routing and scheduling decisions are very difficult, because customers have different needs and servers have different skill levels. A further complication is that it is preferable that these decisions are made blindly; that is, they depend only on the system state and not on system parameter information such as call arrival rates and service speeds. This is because this information is generally not known with certainty. Ideally, a dynamic control policy for making routing and scheduling decisions balances customer and server needs by keeping customer delays low but still fairly dividing the workload amongst the various servers. In this paper, we propose a blind dynamic control policy for parallel-server systems with multiple customer classes and server pools that is based on the number of customers waiting and the number of agents idling.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1129","","OR","Multidisciplinary","4","['fairness', 'customers', 'workload']","The article discusses fairness in routing and scheduling decisions, which suggests a consideration of equitable treatment of customers and servers.

We focus on a class of MOS criteria that favors diversification, which has the potential to mitigate severe shortfalls in scenarios when any objective fails to achieve its target. Naturally, this class excludes joint success probability. We further propose the shortfall-aware MOS criterion (S-MOS), which is inspired by the probability measure and is diversification favoring. We also show how to build tractable approximations of the S-MOS criterion. Because the S-MOS criterion maximization is not a convex optimization problem, we propose improvement algorithms via solving sequences of convex optimization problems.

A recent report by the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress chaired by Senator Charles E. Schumer has estimated that the total cost to the U.S. economy because of flight delays was as much as $41 billion in 2007. The goal of this paper is to build stochastic models of airline networks and utilize publicly available data to answer the following policy questions: Which are the bottleneck airports in the U.S. air-travel infrastructure (i.e., airports that cause most delay propagation)? How would increasing airport capacity at these airports alleviate delay propagation? What are the appropriate metrics for measuring the robustness of airline schedules? How could these schedules be made more robust? Which flight in an aircraft rotation is a bottleneck flight (and, hence, deserves managerial attention)? Flight delays are typically attributed to two factors: (i) the randomness in the intrinsic travel time for a scheduled flight (which is the travel time excluding propagated delays), and (ii) the propagation of this randomness through the air-travel network and infrastructure. We model both of these factors that cause travel delays. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we develop stochastic models, using empirical data, to analyze the propagation of delays through air-transportation networks. Our stochastic models allow us to develop three important robustness measures for airline networks. Second, our analysis enables us to make policy recommendations regarding managing bottleneck resources in the air-travel infrastructure, which, if addressed, could lead to a significant improvement in air-travel reliability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1146","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling and policy recommendations related to airline delays without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A key theorem is proved according to which a facet of the k-node problem defined on the multigraph resulting from a k-partition is also facet defining for the larger problem under a mild condition. After reviewing the prior work on two-partition inequalities, we develop two classes of three-partition inequalities and a large number of inequality classes based on four-partitions. Proofs of facet-defining status for some of these are provided, while the rest are stated without proof. Computational results show that the addition of three- and four-partition inequalities results in substantial increase in the bound values compared to those possible with two-partition inequalities alone.

Maintaining the currency of discovered knowledge over evolving data sources is a fundamental challenge faced by all KDD applications. This paper addresses the challenge from the perspective of deciding the right times to refresh knowledge. We define the knowledge-refreshing problem and model it as a Markov decision process. Based on the identified properties of the Markov decision process model, we establish that the optimal knowledge-refreshing policy is monotonically increasing in the system state within every appropriate partition of the state space. We further show that the problem of searching for the optimal knowledge-refreshing policy can be reduced to the problem of finding the optimal thresholds and propose a method for computing the optimal knowledge-refreshing policy. The effectiveness and the robustness of the computed optimal knowledge-refreshing policy are examined through extensive empirical studies addressing a real-world knowledge-refreshing problem.

Linear programming (LP) has been very successful in obtaining structural insights and devising solution methods for stationary MDPs. However, an LP approach for nonstationary MDPs is currently missing. This is because the LP formulation of a nonstationary infinite-horizon MDP includes countably infinite variables and constraints, and research on such infinite-dimensional LPs has traditionally faced several hurdles. For instance, duality results may not hold; an extreme point may not be a basic feasible solution; and in the context of a simplex algorithm, a pivot operation may require infinite data and computations, and a sequence of improving extreme points need not converge in value to optimal. In this paper, we tackle these challenges and establish (1) weak and strong duality, (2) complementary slackness, (3) a basic feasible solution characterization of extreme points, (4) a one-to-one correspondence between extreme points and deterministic Markovian policies, and (5) we devise a simplex algorithm for an infinite-dimensional LP formulation of nonstationary infinite-horizon MDPs. Pivots in this simplex algorithm use finite data, perform finite computations, and generate a sequence of improving extreme points that converges in value to optimal. Moreover, this sequence of extreme points gets arbitrarily close to the set of optimal extreme points. We also prove that decisions prescribed by these extreme points are eventually exactly optimal in all states of the nonstationary infinite-horizon MDP in early periods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1121","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of linear programming and Markov decision processes without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

For example, the use of weight restrictions may also lead to zero or negative efficiency scores of some units. Removing problematic units from the data set does not necessarily remove the underlying problem caused by the weight restrictions and only makes it undetected. We prove that all such problems arise when weight restrictions induce free or unlimited production of outputs in the underlying technology.

The search  can be interpreted as the optimal method of mining known coal seams, when the time to move miners or machines is negligible compared to digging time. When the Hider distribution is unknown, we consider the zero-sum search game where the Hider picks H, the Searcher S, and the payoff is T. For trees Q, the value is V = (\u03bb(Q) + D)/2, where D is a mean distance from root to leaf nodes. If Q is 2-arc connected, V = \u03bb(Q)/2. Applications and interpretations of the expanding search paradigm are given, particularly to multiple agent search.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1134","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing search strategies within a technical framework, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The first variant assumes that there is uncertainty regarding whether a selected set can cover an item, and the objective is to determine a minimum-cost combination of sets so that each item is covered with a prespecified probability. The second variant seeks to maximize the minimum probability that a selected set can cover all items. To date, literature on this problem has focused on the special case in which uncertainties are independent. In this paper, we formulate deterministic mixed-integer programming models for distributionally robust PSC problems with correlated uncertainties. By exploiting the supermodularity of certain substructures and analyzing their polyhedral properties, we develop strong valid inequalities to strengthen the formulations. Computational results illustrate that our modeling approach can outperform formulations in which correlations are ignored and that our algorithms can significantly reduce overall computation time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1135","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in operations research without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

The explicit hitting set problem is as follows: given a set U and a family S of subsets of U, find a minimum-cardinality set that intersects (hits) every set in S. In the implicit hitting set problem (IHSP), the family of subsets S is not explicitly listed (its size is, generally, exponential in terms of the size of U); instead, it is given via a polynomial-time oracle that verifies if a given set H is a hitting set or returns a set in S that is not hit by H. Many NP-hard problems can be straightforwardly formulated as implicit hitting set problems. We show that the implicit hitting set approach is valuable in developing exact and heuristic algorithms for solving this class of combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, we provide a generic algorithmic strategy, which combines efficient heuristics and exact methods, to solve any IHSP. Given an instance of an IHSP, the proposed algorithmic strategy gives a sequence of feasible solutions and lower bounds on the optimal solution value and ultimately yields an optimal solution. We specialize this algorithmic strategy to solve the multigenome alignment problem and present computational results that illustrate the effectiveness of the implicit hitting set approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1139","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We show theoretically, through some simplified models, that incorporating gradient estimators into stochastic kriging tends to significantly improve surface prediction. To address the issue of which type of gradient estimator to use, when there is a choice, we briefly review stochastic gradient estimation techniques; we then focus on the properties of infinitesimal perturbation analysis and likelihood ratio/score function gradient estimators and make recommendations. To conclude, we use simulation experiments with no simplifying assumptions to demonstrate that the use of stochastic kriging with gradient estimators provides more reliable prediction results than stochastic kriging alone.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1143","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology in stochastic modeling without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We investigate how the set of possible 1D packings can be tightened using the overlapping information of item projections on the axes, with the goal to tighten the relaxation. We integrate the bar relaxation into an interval-graph algorithm for OPP, which operates on such overlapping relations.

When every attribute is utility independent of its complement, the utility elicitation task is significantly simplified because the functional form of the utility function requires only one conditional utility function for each attribute, and some normalizing constants. When utility independence conditions do not hold, the conditional utility function of an attribute may vary across the domain of the complement attributes, and therefore a single conditional utility assessment for each attribute may not be sufficient to capture the decision maker's preferences. This paper proposes a method to construct utility functions that have the flexibility to match the variations in the conditional utility function, across the domain of the attributes, using univariate utility assessments at the boundary values. The approach incorporates the boundary assessments into a new function, which we call the double-sided utility copula. This formulation provides a wealth of new functional forms that the analyst may use to incorporate utility dependence in multiattribute decision problems. The utility copula function also allows for the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of trade-off assessments among the attributes, while keeping the utility assessments at the boundary values fixed. It is also useful in determining the order of approximation provided by using certain independence assumptions in a multiattribute decision problem when the attributes are utility dependent.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1120.1152","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision analysis and utility functions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2013","61","2","Roberto BaldacciRoberto Baldaccir.baldacci@unibo.itDepartment of Electronics, Computer Science, and Systems, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, ItalySearch for more papers by this author, Aristide MingozziAristide Mingozzimingozzi@csr.unibo.itDepartment of Mathematics, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, ItalySearch for more papers by this author, Roberto RobertiRoberto Robertiroberto.roberti6@unibo.itDepartment of Electronics, Computer Science, and Systems, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, ItalySearch for more papers by this author, Roberto Wolfler CalvoRoberto Wolfler Calvoroberto.wolfler@lipn.univ-paris13.frLaboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord, Universit\u00e9 de Paris 13; and Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, CNRS (UMR 7538), 93430 Villetaneuse, FranceSearch for more papers by this author","An Exact Algorithm for the Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem","In the two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem (2E-CVRP), the delivery to customers from a depot uses intermediate depots, called satellites.

We consider both random attackers and strategic attackers. A random attacker chooses which node to attack according to a probability distribution known to the patroller. A strategic attacker plays a two-person zero-sum game with the patroller. For each case, we give an exact linear program to compute the optimal solution. Because the linear programs quickly become computationally intractable as the problem size grows, we develop index-based heuristics. In the random-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes, and in a suitably chosen asymptotic regime. In the strategic-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes if the attack times are deterministic taking integer values.

We do not assume any exact distributional form of the service durations, and we solve for distributionally robust schedules that minimize the expectation of the weighted sum of patients' waiting time and the doctor's overtime. We formulate this scheduling problem as a convex conic optimization problem with a tractable semidefinite relaxation. Our model can be extended to handle additional support constraints of the service durations. Using the primal\u2013dual optimality conditions, we prove several interesting structural properties of the optimal schedules. We develop an efficient semidefinite relaxation of the conic program and show that we can still obtain near-optimal solutions on benchmark instances in the existing literature. We apply our approach to develop a practical appointment schedule at an eye clinic that can significantly improve the efficiency of the appointment system in the clinic, compared to an existing schedule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1158","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to appointment scheduling in a healthcare setting, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For this reason, it is often an effective strategy to first divide the service region and impose that each vehicle is only responsible for its own subregion. This heuristic also has the practical advantage that over time, drivers become more effective at serving their territory and customers. In this paper, we assume that client locations are unknown at the time of partitioning the territory and that each of them will be drawn identically and independently according to a distribution that is actually also unknown. In practice, it might be impossible to identify precisely the distribution if, for instance, information about the demand is limited to historical data. Our approach suggests partitioning the region with respect to the worst-case distribution that satisfies first- and second-order moments information. As a side product, our analysis constructs for each subregion a closed-form expression for the worst-case density function, thus providing useful insights about what affects the completion time most heavily. The successful implementation of our approach relies on two branch-and-bound algorithms: whereas the first finds a globally optimal partition of a convex polygon into two convex subregions, the second finds a local optimum for the harder n-partitioning problem. Finally, simulations of a parcel delivery problem will demonstrate that our data-driven approach makes better use of historical data as it becomes available.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1160","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of vehicle routing and optimization without addressing any social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We begin by grouping the targets into clusters of manageable size. The heuristics are derived from a model that treats these clusters as independent. The upper bounds are given by assuming each cluster has perfect information about the results from all other clusters. The analysis relies heavily on results for bandit superprocesses, a generalization of the multiarmed bandit problem.

This cardinality constrained investment situation naturally arises due to the presence of various forms of market friction, such as transaction costs and management fees, or even due to the consideration of mental cost. Unfortunately, the combinatorial nature of such a portfolio selection problem formulation makes the exact solution process NP-hard in general. We focus in this paper on the cardinality constrained mean-variance portfolio selection problem. Instead of tailoring such a difficult problem into the general solution framework of mixed-integer programming formulation, we explore the special structures and rich geometric properties behind the mathematical formulation. Applying the Lagrangian relaxation to the primal problem results in a pure cardinality constrained portfolio selection problem, which possesses a symmetric property, and to which geometric approaches can be developed. Different from the existing literature that has primarily focused on some direct relaxations of the cardinality constraint, we consider modifying the objective function to some separable relaxations, which are immune to the hard cardinality constraint. More specifically, we develop efficient lower bounding schemes by using the circumscribed box, the circumscribed ball, and the circumscribed axis-aligned ellipsoid to approximate the objective contour of the problem. In particular, all these cardinality constrained relaxation problems can be solved analytically. Furthermore, we derive efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the corresponding dual search problems. Most promisingly, the lower bounding scheme using the circumscribed axis-aligned ellipsoid leads to a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation and offers a sharp bound and high-quality feasible solution. By integrating these lower bounding schemes into a branch-and-bound algorithm (BnB), our solution scheme outperforms CPLEX significantly in identifying the exact optimal portfolio.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1170","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In some situations, however, the assumption of homogeneity among DMUs may not apply. As an example, consider the case where the DMUs are plants in the same industry that may not all produce the same products. Evaluating efficiencies in the absence of homogeneity gives rise to the issue of how to fairly compare a DMU to other units, some of which may not be exactly in the same \u201cbusiness.\u201d A related problem, and one that has been examined extensively in the literature, is the missing data problem; a DMU produces a certain output, but its value is not known. One approach taken to address this problem is to \u201ccreate\u201d a value for the missing output (e.g., substituting zero, or by taking the average of known values), and use it to fill in the gaps. In the present setting, however, the issue isn't that the data for the output is missing for certain DMUs, but rather that the output isn't produced. We argue herein that if a DMU has chosen not to produce a certain output, or for any reason cannot produce that output, and therefore does not put the resources in place to do so, then it would be inappropriate to artificially assign that DMU a zero value or some \u201caverage\u201d value for the nonexistent factor. Specifically, the desire is to fairly evaluate a DMU for what it does, rather than penalize or credit it for what it doesn't do. In the current paper we present DEA-based models for evaluating the relative efficiencies of a set of DMUs where the requirement of homogeneity is relaxed. We then use these models to examine the efficiencies of a set of manufacturing plants.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1173","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['fairly', 'evaluate', 'nonhomogeneous']","The article discusses the importance of fairly evaluating decision-making units (DMUs) without penalizing them for factors outside their control, which hints at a consideration for equity.

Many EDs frequently report periods of overcrowding during which they are forced to divert incoming ambulances to neighboring hospitals, a phenomenon known as \u201cambulance diversion.\u201d The objective of this paper is to study the impact of key operational characteristics of the hospitals such as the number of ED beds, the number of inpatient beds, and the utilization of inpatient beds on the extent to which hospitals go on ambulance diversion. We propose a simple queueing network model to describe the patient flow between the ED and the inpatient department. We analyze this network using two different approximations\u2014diffusion and fluid\u2014to derive two separate sets of measures for inpatient occupancy and ED size. We use these sets of measures to form hypotheses and test them by estimating a sample selection model using data on a cross section of hospitals from California. We find that the measures derived from the diffusion approximation provide better explanation of the data than those derived from the fluid approximation. For this model, we find that the fraction of time that the ED spends on diversion is decreasing in the spare capacity of the inpatient department and in the size of the ED, where both are appropriately normalized for the size of the inpatient department. In addition, controlling for these hospital-specific factors, we find that the fraction of time on diversion at a hospital increases with the number of hospitals in its neighborhood. We also find that certain hospitals, owing to their location, ownership, and trauma center status, are more likely to choose ambulance diversion to mitigate overcrowding than others.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1176","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['emergency services', 'overcrowding', 'ambulance diversion']","The article primarily focuses on operational characteristics and technical aspects of hospital management without addressing social justice or ethical implications.

For dynamic portfolio control, sources of model error include the evolution of market factors and the influence of these factors on asset returns. We develop portfolio control rules that are robust to this type of uncertainty, applying a stochastic notion of robustness to uncertainty in model dynamics. In this stochastic formulation, robustness reflects uncertainty about the probability law generating market data, and not just uncertainty about model parameters. We analyze both finite- and infinite-horizon problems in a model in which returns are driven by factors that evolve stochastically. The model incorporates transaction costs and leads to simple and tractable optimal robust controls for multiple assets. We illustrate the performance of the controls on historical data.

Incorporating such multivariate preference rules into optimization models is a fairly recent research area. Existing studies focus on extending univariate stochastic dominance rules to the multivariate case. However, enforcing multivariate stochastic dominance constraints can often be overly conservative in practice. As an alternative, we focus on the widely applied risk measure conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), introduce a multivariate CVaR relation, and develop a novel optimization model with multivariate CVaR constraints based on polyhedral scalarization. To solve such problems for finite probability spaces, we develop a cut generation algorithm, where each cut is obtained by solving a mixed-integer problem. We show that a multivariate CVaR constraint reduces to finitely many univariate CVaR constraints, which proves the finite convergence of our algorithm. We also show that our results can be naturally extended to a wider class of coherent risk measures. The proposed approach provides a flexible and computationally tractable way of modeling preferences in stochastic multicriteria decision making. We conduct a computational study for a budget allocation problem to illustrate the effect of enforcing multivariate CVaR constraints and demonstrate the computational performance of the proposed solution methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1186","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization models and risk measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In general, these auctions are run as variants of second-price auctions but have been shown to be incentive incompatible. Thus, advertisers have to be strategic about bidding. Uncertainty in the decision-making environment, budget constraints, and the presence of a large portfolio of keywords makes the bid optimization problem nontrivial. We present an analytical model to compute the optimal bids for keywords in an advertiser's portfolio. To validate our approach, we estimate the parameters of the model using data from an advertiser's sponsored search campaign and use the bids proposed by the model in a field experiment. The results of the field implementation show that the proposed bidding technique is very effective in practice. We extend our model to account for interactions between keywords, in the form of positive spillovers from generic keywords into branded keywords.

To study its impact on production planning, we develop a dynamic production model, where a manufacturer produces a single product to satisfy random market demands. The manufacturer has access to both a green and a regular production technology, of which the former is more costly but yields fewer emissions. To comply with the emissions regulations, the manufacturer can buy or sell the allowances in each period via forward contracts in an outside market with stochastic trading prices while needing to keep a nonnegative allowance account balance at the end of the planning horizon. We first derive several important structural properties of the model, and based upon them, we characterize the optimal emissions trading and production policies that minimize the manufacturer's expected total discounted cost. In particular, the optimal emissions trading policy is a target interval policy with two thresholds that decrease with the starting inventory level. The optimal production policy is established by first determining the optimal technology choice and then showing the optimality of a base-stock type of production policy. We show that the optimal base-stock level is independent of the starting inventory level and the allowance level when the manufacturer trades the allowance or uses both technologies simultaneously. A numerical study using representative data from the cement industry is conducted to illustrate the analytical results and to examine the value of green technology for the manufacturer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1189","","OR","Multidisciplinary","6","['emissions trading', 'green technology', 'sustainability']","The article discusses emissions trading and the use of green technology, which are indicative of sustainability and environmental responsibility themes.

The assumption that the distribution is IGFR is thus useful and frequently held in recent pricing, revenue, and supply chain management literature. This note contributes to the IGFR literature in several ways. First, it investigates the prevalence of the IGFR property for the left and right truncations of valuation distributions. Second, we extend the IGFR notion to discrete distributions and contrast it with the continuous distribution case. The note also addresses two errors in the previous IGFR literature.

Significant technological investments have led to dramatic improvements in latency, the delay between a trading decision and the resulting trade execution. We describe a theoretical model for the quantitative valuation of latency. Our model measures the trading frictions created by the presence of latency, by considering the optimal execution problem of a representative investor. Via a dynamic programming analysis, our model provides a closed-form expression for the cost of latency in terms of well-known parameters of the underlying asset. We implement our model by estimating the latency cost incurred by trading on a human time scale. Examining NYSE common stocks from 1995 to 2005 shows that median latency cost across our sample roughly tripled during this time period. Furthermore, using the same data set, we compute a measure of implied latency and conclude that the median implied latency decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude. Empirically calibrated, our model suggests that the reduction in cost achieved by going from trading on a human time scale to a low latency time scale is comparable with other execution costs faced by the most cost efficient institutional investors, and it is consistent with the rents that are extracted by ultra-low latency agents, such as providers of automated execution services or high frequency traders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1165","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of high-frequency trading and latency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The factors of the decision are arranged in hierarchical or network structures and judgments are then made by the decision maker, or by an expert, about the dominant element for each pair with respect to a common property. From simple judgments on two elements at a time with respect to a common property, priority vectors are obtained that are combined throughout the structure to give the best outcome for a decision. The judgments may be inconsistent, and there is a mathematical way to measure inconsistency so that the outlying judgments may be revised by the decision maker in an acceptable way or a decision may be delayed until more consistent information is obtained. In practical applications using either hierarchical or network structures, decisions are often analyzed in separate parts for their benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, and the results are then combined in an appropriate way into an overall synthesis of those priorities. The mathematics has been generalized in the literature to the Neural Network Process (NNP), the continuous case for modeling how the brain synthesizes signals.

Approach proportions contain travelers' route information so that the realistic effects of physical queues can be captured in a formulation when a physical-queue traffic flow model is adopted, and so that route enumeration and path-set generation can be avoided in the solution procedure. In addition, the simple structure of the approach proportion representation allows us to decompose the constraint set for solving large-scale DUO route choice problems. This paper also discusses the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the VI problem and develops a solution algorithm based on the extragradient method to solve the proposed VI problem. This solution algorithm makes use of the decomposition property of the constraint set and is convergent if the travel time functions are pseudomonotone and Lipschitz continuous. It is not necessary to know the Lipschitz constant of the travel time functions in advance.

With the added confidence provided by this more realistic approach, Bayer's executive leadership team acted on the recommendation from the decision analysis in contrast to an earlier analysis that had not resulted in management action. The paper makes two major contributions: First, it describes the details of what is involved in conducting applied decision analysis in a real-world setting in more detail than what is typically in textbooks on decision analysis. Second, the paper illustrates the important role of economic modeling in a large-scale applied decision analysis. The approach is applicable to other product-generation transition decision making for expanding global production capacity under uncertainty in a supply-constrained environment, especially for new product introductions and new product development decisions when supply is limited.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1204","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on decision analysis and economic modeling related to production capacity and supply-demand imbalances, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Within a Bayesian formulation of this problem, the optimal fully sequential policy for allocating simulation effort is the solution to a dynamic program. When sampling is limited by probabilistic termination or sampling costs, we show that this dynamic program can be solved efficiently, providing a tractable way to compute the Bayes-optimal policy. The solution uses techniques from optimal stopping and multiarmed bandits. We then present further theoretical results characterizing this Bayes-optimal policy, compare it numerically to several approximate policies, and apply it to applications in emergency services and manufacturing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1207","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Bayesian policies and simulation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2013","61","5","Kabir RustogiKabir Rustogik.rustogi@greenwich.ac.ukSchool of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Old Royal Naval College, University of Greenwich, London SE10 9LS, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author, Vitaly A.

The focus of this study is on the impact that additional machines may have, if added to the system. We measure such a machine impact by the ratio of the value of the objective function computed with the original number of machines to the one computed with extra machines. We give tight bounds on the machine impact for the problem of minimizing the makespan, for both the preemptive and non-preemptive versions, as well as for the problem of minimizing the total flow time.

In this work, we strive to combine the ideas from these different fields into a single methodology to learn preferences and make decisions. We use robust and integer optimization in an adaptive and dynamic way to determine preferences from data that are consistent with human behavior. We use integer optimization to address human inconsistency, robust optimization and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to address loss aversion, and adaptive conjoint analysis and linear optimization to frame the questions to learn preferences. The paper makes the following methodological contributions: to the robust optimization literature by proposing a method to derive uncertainty sets from adaptive questionnaires, to the marketing literature by using the analytic center of discrete sets (as opposed to polyhedra) to capture errors and inconsistencies, and to the risk modeling literature by using efficient methods from computer science for sampling to optimize CVaR.

The operational performance of equipment is determined by joint decisions of the firm (client) and the service provider (vendor). Although some decisions are verifiable and thus directly contractible, many decisions are not. The result is a double-sided moral hazard environment in which each party has incentives to free ride on the other's effort. A performance-based contract allows the client to align the incentives of the vendor, but it also exposes the vendor to stochastic earnings and thereby creates disincentives to make first-best decisions. To capture these issues, we develop a novel principal-agent model by integrating elements of the machine repairman model and a stochastic financial distress model within the double-sided moral hazard framework. We apply our model to solve the client's problem of designing the optimal performance-based contract. We find that the client can attain the first-best profit by restricting the search space to only two classes of performance-based contract structures: linear and tiered. We show that the linear contract structure has limited ability in attaining the first-best outcome, contingent on the vendor's exogenous characteristics. In contrast, the tiered contract structure enables the client to attain the first-best outcome regardless of vendor characteristics. Our results provide normative insights on the role of contract structures in eliminating any loss due to double-sided moral hazard or to the vendor's financial concerns. These results also provide theoretical support for the extensive use of tiered contracts observed in practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1210","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract design and performance-based contracts without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Despite the desire to elicit honest forecasts, such competition induces forecasters to report strategically and nontruthfully. The question we address is whether the competitive crowd's forecast (the average of strategic forecasts) is more accurate than the truthful crowd's forecast (the average of truthful forecasts from the same forecasters). We analyze a forecasting competition in which a prize is awarded to the forecaster whose point forecast is closest to the actual outcome. Before reporting a forecast, we assume each forecaster receives two signals: one common and one private. These signals represent the forecasters' past shared and personal experiences relevant for forecasting the uncertain quantity of interest. In a set of equilibrium results, we characterize the nature of the strategic forecasts in this game. As the correlation among the forecasters' private signals increases, the forecasters switch from using a pure to a mixed strategy. In both cases, forecasters exaggerate their private information and thereby make the competitive crowd's forecast more accurate than the truthful crowd's forecast.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1213","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on forecasting accuracy in competitive environments without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this setting, patients periodically visit the healthcare delivery system, which influences their disease progression and consequently their health outcomes. We investigate how the provider can maximize community-level health outcomes through better operational decisions pertaining to capacity allocation across different patients. To do so, we develop an integrated capacity allocation model that incorporates clinical (disease progression) and operational (capacity constraint) aspects. Specifically, we model the provider's problem as a finite horizon stochastic dynamic program, where the provider decides which patients to schedule at the beginning of each period. Therapy is provided to scheduled patients, which may improve their health states. Patients that are not seen follow their natural disease progression. We derive a quantitative measure for comparison of patients' health states and use it to design an easy-to-implement myopic heuristic that is provably optimal in special cases of the problem. We employ the myopic heuristic in a more general setting and test its performance using operational and clinical data obtained from Mobile C.A.R.E. Foundation, a community-based provider of pediatric asthma care in Chicago. Our extensive computational experiments suggest that the myopic heuristic can improve the health gains at the community level by up to 15% over the current policy. The benefit is driven by the ability of our myopic heuristic to alter the duration between visits for patients with different health states depending on the tightness of the capacity and the health states of the entire patient population.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2013.1214","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['community-based', 'health outcomes', 'capacity allocation', 'patients', 'health gains']","The article emphasizes improving health outcomes at the community level and focuses on operational decisions that affect patient care, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social equity and community health.

Moreover, we also show that further variations within the policy classes, such as nested instead of partition booking limit, or certainty equivalent instead of additive bid price, are simply indistinguishable in terms of their order of revenue loss under frequent re-solvings. This negative result highlights the limitation of re-solving deterministic linear programs when the solution is interpreted as either a booking limit or a bid price.

Members of the first request a reservation ahead of service and will not patronize the firm without one. Members of the second walk in and demand service immediately. These customers have a fixed cost of reaching the firm and may behave strategically. In equilibrium, they randomize between walking in and staying home. The service provider must decide how much of a limited capacity to make available to advance customers. When the advance demand segment offers a higher per customer margin, the firm may opt to decline some reservation requests in order to bolster walk-in demand. When walk-in customers are more valuable, classical revenue management models would dictate that at least some capacity be set aside for high-value later arrivals. Here it is possible that the optimal policy saves no capacity for walk-ins. Thus, it may be better to ignore rather than pamper walk-in customers.

We consider seven different backbone network topologies for connecting the hub nodes, namely, the Steiner and minimum spanning trees, a travelling salesman tour, a star network, a capacitated vehicle routing tour, a complete bipartite graph, and a complete graph. We also perform an additional analysis on a multilevel network in which network flows move through multiple levels of transshipment before reaching the service region.

Both the random environment and the random arrival rate of each DSRP are driven by a finite state continuous time Markov chain. The scheduling policy optimizes in a greedy fashion with respect to each queue and environmental state. Since the closed-form solution for the performance of such a queuing system under the policy is difficult to obtain, we establish a reflecting diffusion with regime-switching model for its measures of performance. Furthermore, we justify its asymptotic optimality by deriving the stochastic fluid and diffusion limits for the corresponding system under heavy traffic. In addition, we identify a cost function related to the utility function, which is minimized by minimizing the workload process in the diffusion limit.

A Conceptual Examination of Workplace Crimes and Organizational Identification","Although research has shown that there may be very different types of workplace crimes, scholarly work in this area (a) is currently fragmented with very little communication between very similar streams of research and (b) tends to be incomplete and can lead to conflicting findings. We address both of these shortcomings. First, we propose a typology of different types of workplace crimes (consisting of pro-organizational, nonaligned-organizational, and anti-organizational crimes) based on the intentions of the perpetrators. Second, we link these intentions to various identification \u201cpathologies\u201d\u2014such as over-identification and over-disidentification, under-identification and ambivalent identification\u2014and argue that these pathologies are linked to propensities to commit certain types of workplace crimes. Specifically, we contend that over-identification and over-disidentification have direct effects on workplace crimes, whereas under-identification and ambivalent identification indirectly influence the propensity to engage in workplace crimes. We suggest that this research aids us in clarifying the inconsistent conclusions in previous work in the domain of workplace crimes and that it emphasizes the importance of including organizational identification as a key factor in the extant models of workplace crimes. This research also highlights policy implications regarding workplace crimes in that it suggests that different agencies may be more effective in enforcing the law and disciplining those engaged in the different types of workplace crimes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0714","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['workplace crimes', 'organizational identification', 'policy implications']","The article discusses workplace crimes and their relationship with organizational identification, suggesting a focus on ethical considerations and policy implications.

We find that corporate density enhances the growth of both types of nonprofits, as does location in the northeast United States and a long-established business community, but corporate density is especially potent for the growth of elite-oriented nonprofits\u2014but not social welfare nonprofits\u2014when local networks and cultural norms support elite mobilization.

This study argues that the concept of coevolution offers a bridge between the prescient adaptationist and ex post selectionist perspectives of organizational change to account for the increasing rates of change. The mutual causal influences in a coevolutionary relationship help explain why competing sets of firms or individual firms can capture dominant shares in product markets. Using a comparative historical method and drawing on evidence from five countries over a 60-year period, this paper inquires how precisely coevolutionary processes work in shaping the evolution of industries and important features of their environments. It identifies\u2014in the context of the synthetic dye industry\u2014three causal mechanisms (exchange of personnel, commercial ties, and lobbying) and suggests how they acted as levers on the fundamental mechanisms of evolution. Understanding the levers is important for managing change in a world that is increasingly becoming coevolutionary, requiring managers to focus more on the emergent, system-level properties of their environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0718","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'organizational change', 'co-evolution']","The article discusses organizational adaptation and coevolution but lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, which are key indicators of wokeness.

We study the pre-entry generation of founders' market choice sets by investigating their search for market opportunities in which the firm's technological resources, as embodied in a product or service, can be commercialized. Analyzing data collected through personal interviews with founders of 496 technology ventures, we find that founding teams with more diverse industry experience and more diverse external knowledge sourcing relationships identify not only a larger number of but, in particular, more varied (distant) market opportunities. However, the extent to which strategic variety of such opportunities is identified depends on the founders' technological expertise, whereas technological expertise is less relevant in identification of the number of opportunities. Furthermore, by showing that the extent and nature of the firm's pre-entry opportunity set has a significant effect on the likelihood of subsequent firm diversification, we document how initial constraints in founders' choice sets can have a lasting impact on the growth potential that the new firm exploits over time.

Results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) reveal that conventional arguments about poor performance hold for both related and unrelated firm operations in countries characterized by low growth, policy stability, and exchange rate stability. However, the results also show that there are significant differences across the divestment decisions of firms for their related and unrelated foreign operations in countries characterized by high growth, policy instability, and exchange rate volatility.

Using data on the outsourcing of patent legal services, we find empirical evidence that outsourced knowledge-based service work is concentrated in the hands of fewer suppliers when (1) it requires greater firm-specific knowledge, (2) there is a higher level of interrelatedness across outsourced projects, (3) the firm's reliance on outsourcing is high, (4) its outsourced projects are focused on a narrower (capability) domain, and (5) the technological dynamism of this domain is low.

The first two schools, respectively, view strategic differentiation as especially common among family firms and an important source of competitive advantage. By contrast, the reasoning of institutionalists would suggest that family firms will be subject to unusually powerful motivations to conform, in part because of their pursuit of socioemotional wealth objectives. Unfortunately, the relationships between conformity and family firm governance\u2014and, in fact, governance in general\u2014have not been amply studied. This analysis of Fortune 1000 firms finds considerable support for the institutional perspective: family involvement is related to greater, not lesser, conformity in many aspects of strategy.

While the importance of search for dealing with complex systems is widely acknowledged, how organizations should structure their search processes remains largely unexplored. This paper starts to address basic questions: How much of the entire system, and thus complexity, should be taken into consideration at any given time during a search process? Should a problem solver pursue an integrated search and be concerned with the whole system right from the start, or should a problem solver incrementally expand the \u201csearch domain,\u201d i.e., the subset of system elements and interdependencies that are included in the search efforts? If the latter, how \u201cchunky\u201d should these steps be? Our analysis of a simulation model yields four insights: (1) expanding the search domain in smaller steps can yield a distinct advantage in final system performance, (2) following a completely incremental expansion pattern is not necessary as long as larger chunks are added early on in the process, (3) the value of chunky search is particularly high if highly influential system elements are considered first and highly dependent elements are added later, and (4) under time pressure, chunky search can lose its performance advantage over more integrated search processes.

In this theoretical paper, I outline a model of organizational identification that aims to do three things\u2014account for the role of identity in the identification process, integrate and extend disparate approaches to organizational identification, and illuminate social comparison processes underlying members' organizational evaluations. The model proposes that members undertake two identity comparisons to assess the value of organizational membership for identification purposes. In one, they compare the organization's current identity with their own identity, allowing them to assess the organization's ability to meet their motivation for self-continuity. In the other, they compare the organization's current identity with its expected identity, allowing them to assess the organization's ability to meet their motivation for self-esteem. After introducing the identity congruence framework, I apply to it the identity orientation lens to make specific predictions about how organizational and member identity shape the nature and outcomes of the specific social comparison content drawn upon in each of the two identity comparisons. This analysis reveals how the metrics used to evaluate organizations fundamentally vary by organizational and member identity.

The conceptual framework is applied in a study of two occasions of identity reconstruction in the LEGO Group, which revealed differences in ways that the past was evoked and influenced claims for future identity. Our study suggests that (1) a longer time perspective in the use of memory enabled a longer time perspective in formulating claims for future identity, (2) a broader scope of articulated identity claims for the future was related to the combination of a broader range of memory forms, and (3) the depth of claims for future identity was related to the way in which memory forms were combined.

However, others have argued that voice can lead to unfavorable outcomes for employees. To begin resolving these competing perspectives, we examine agreement and disagreement between employees and their managers on the extent to which employees provide upward voice, proposing and demonstrating that considering either perspective alone does not fully capture how voice is related to employee outcomes. Findings from a study of 7,578 subordinates and their 335 general managers within a national restaurant chain indicate that agreement between employees and managers that employees display a high level of voice leads to favorable outcomes for employees. Our findings then extend existing research by showing that supervisor\u2013subordinate disagreement around voice also helps explain employee outcomes\u2014namely, how negative outcomes arise as a result of employees overestimating their voice relative to their managers' perspective and how positive outcomes result when employees underestimate their upward voice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0732","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['employee voice', 'managerial performance', 'outcomes', 'prosocail']","The article discusses the concept of 'employee voice,' which relates to the inclusion of employee perspectives in managerial decision-making, reflecting themes of equity and representation.

Viewing alliance withdrawal as a result of firms' pursuit of more promising alternative partners (outside options) rather than failures in collaboration, we predict that a firm is more likely to withdraw from an alliance when there is a higher density of outside options that have better match quality than the current partners. We also propose that, because matching is two-sided, outside options have a greater impact on a firm's withdrawal when they are more likely to initiate new alliances. Using data on alliances in the global liner shipping industry, we show that, controlling for internal tensions in the alliance, outside options predict alliance withdrawals. Thus, despite the alliance stickiness and stability, firms alter their alliances in response to the availability of promising outside options, even leaving alliances that appear successful.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0733","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic alliances and withdrawal decisions based on economic factors without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Drawing on Randall Collins' interaction ritual theory, we identify how mutual focus of attention develops through the presence of a task bubble that focuses attention by creating barriers to outsiders and through the effective use of task-related artifacts. Shared emotion both results from mutual focus of attention and reinforces it. Through our comparison between the two projects, we show that the group engagement process is enabled by factors at the individual (individual engagement), interaction (frequency and informality of interactions), and project (compelling direction of the overall group) levels. Our focus on group interaction episodes as the engine of the group engagement process illuminates what individuals do when they are performing the focal work of the group (i.e., solving problems related to the task at hand) and how they develop and sustain the mutual focus of attention that is required for making collective progress on the task itself. We also show the relationship between the group engagement process and effective problem solving.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0738","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['group engagement', 'shared emotion', 'mutual focus']","The article discusses group engagement and shared emotion, which touch on collaboration and interpersonal dynamics, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques typical of higher woke scores.

Although nonnative speakers shared a common attitude of resentment and distrust toward their native English-speaking coworkers, their behavioral responses\u2014assertion, inhibition, or learning\u2014to encounters with native speakers differed based on their self-perceived fluencies.

In this paper, we develop four different categories of tacit knowledge that are derived from the basic tenants of the resource-based framework. More specifically, we distinguish between the discrete and linked forms of productive tacit knowledge that is possessed by individuals and administrative tacit knowledge that is held by managers within an organization. Next, we evaluate the role of each of these four different forms of tacit knowledge by focusing on the contribution of players and managers of professional sports teams. Our analysis of a large sample of Major League Baseball teams from 1985 to 2001 provides significant support for the importance of each of these categories of tacit knowledge for the performance of an organization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0741","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['tacit knowledge', 'organizational resource', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of tacit knowledge and its impact on organizational performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We posit that cross-national variations in corporatist institutional structures (which reflect differences in underlying cooperative norms) influence the relative importance that firms place on a prospective partner's social value (evidenced from the partner's connectedness with members of its industry) and technological value (reflected in the technological complementarity and novelty of the partner's knowledge). We expect that as prospective partners' technological value increases, the probability of alliance formation increases the most for firms residing in less corporatist countries. Likewise, as prospective partners' social value increases, the probability of alliance formation increases the most for firms in more corporatist countries. We further argue that norms regarding knowledge acquisition within an alliance vary across countries, with deliberate learning approaches serving as the norm in less\u2014not more\u2014corporatist settings. We expect that such differences will lead to more immediate interpartner knowledge acquisition in less corporatist environments.

Drawing upon the team theory and modularity literature, it argues that the degree of divisionalization is predicated not only on the extent of interdependence (complexity) among tasks but also on the extent to which those interdependent relationships are decomposable. As such, the feasibility and benefits of modularization in organizational design may be overstated when the underlying tasks are not decomposable. In addition, this paper argues that organizational hierarchy serves to mitigate the tension between complexity and decomposability by facilitating a higher degree of divisionalization. These arguments are tested using data on the business activities and organization structures of U.S. equipment manufacturers in 1993\u20132003. Results show that divisionalization increases with task complexity, suggesting that complex task systems encourage more division of managerial responsibilities. However, divisionalization decreases as task systems become less decomposable. Meanwhile, organizational hierarchy increases with task complexity, and it increases as task systems become less decomposable. These findings highlight the constraints firms face in designing modular organization structures and the role of hierarchy in coordinating complex task systems that are not fully decomposable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0744","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational design and task complexity without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We study the professional form of management consulting organization, which came to dominate other alternatives. Pioneers of this organizational form seized opportunities arising from broad institutional change to discredit the status quo and legitimate their model of how to advise organizations on strategic and operational issues. Similar to institutional entrepreneurs seeking to change mature fields, those in this emerging field engaged in theorization, undertook collective action, and established affiliations with recognized authorities and elites. But unlike institutional entrepreneurs in mature fields, the actors we studied could not leverage logics, positions, or collectivities within their emerging field; instead, they drew on logics from outside their field, sought affiliations with external authorities and elites, and emphasized the benefits of their activities for society at large. Our analysis thus suggests important differences in how actors legitimate novel organizational forms in emerging versus mature fields and underscores the need for theories of institutional entrepreneurship that explicitly account for field context.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0745","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['society', 'legitimate', 'institutional change', 'collective action']","The article discusses the role of institutional entrepreneurs in legitimating new organizational forms and emphasizes the benefits of their activities for society at large, indicating a moderate focus on social impact and ethical considerations.

Yet this activity has been given scarce attention in the extant literature that widely assumes that market labels are simple, prescribed classification brackets that accurately represent firms' characteristics. By examining how and why executives use the nanotechnology label, we uncover three strategies: claiming, disassociating, and hedging. Comparing these strategies to firms' technological capabilities, we find that capabilities alone do not explain executives' label use. Instead, the data show that these strategies are driven by executives' aspiration to symbolically influence their firms' market categorization. In particular, executives' perception of the label's ambiguity, their avoidance of perceived credibility gaps, and their assessment of the label's signaling value shape their labeling strategies. In contrast to extant research, which suggests that executives should aim for coherence, we find that many executives hedge their affiliation with a nascent market label. Thus, our study shows that in ambiguous contexts, noncommitment to a market category may be a particularly prevalent strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0748","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['market labeling', 'executives', 'strategies']","The article primarily focuses on market labeling strategies used by executives in nanotechnology, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Through a study of how employees interpret themselves as growing at three organizations, we develop a theoretical account of how employees draw from contextual and personal resources to interpret their growing in ways that embed their idiosyncratic experiences within an organization. The data suggest that employees develop three different types of growing self-construals: achieving, learning, and helping. We use our data to ground theory that explains the development of growing self-construals as deeply embedded in organizations.

Such distances directly affect individual behavior and shape other features of the context that alter group processes (e.g., by forcing groups to adopt new communication tools). Prior research has examined isolated effects of various dimensions of virtuality without considering how these effects on individual behavior and group dynamics might have conceptually related underpinnings. To address this gap, we propose an extension of construal-level theory as a way to link the effects of virtuality through a common mediating mechanism. According to construal-level theory, events or objects that are physically or temporally distant are also distant psychologically and thus are likely to be described in terms of their general characteristics. In contrast, views of more proximal events or objects will be more detailed and nuanced. We develop propositions that illustrate how objective dimensions of distance create psychological distance and how that in turn affects how individuals view and interact with their teammates. We also develop propositions that show how the context of the distributed group (e.g., technology usage) affects this process over time. We compare and link this construal-based approach to alternatives based in theories of computer-mediated communication and social identity, and we thereby show that construal-level theory offers both parsimonious explanations and novel predictions about how and why distance alters perceptions of distributed group members (including oneself). Finally, we consider theoretical and practical implications of construal-level theory for future organization science research and the management of virtual teams.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0750","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['virtuality', 'group dynamics', 'communication tools']","The article discusses the effects of virtuality on group dynamics and communication, which touches on organizational behavior but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005.

Studies 1 and 2 examine the role of observers' behavioral forecasts in condemning passive victims of sexual harassment. Observers generally predicted that they would engage in greater confrontation than victims typically do. More importantly, the more confrontation participants predicted they would engage in, the more they condemned the passive victim, and the less willing they were to recommend the victim for a job and to work with her. Study 3 identifies the failure to consider important motivations likely experienced by victims\u2014and that contribute to their passivity\u2014as an important driver of behavioral forecasting errors. Having forecasters reflect on motivations normally experienced but not typically forecast produced behavioral predictions that were more consistent with the actual passive behavior of sexual harassment victims.

We study the reactions of securities analysts, as important sources of institutional pressures for firms, to the similar product/market strategies undertaken by firms from different prior industries responding to industry convergence. Our empirical setting is the convergence between the wireline telecommunications and cable television industries in the period following the advent of voice over Internet protocol technology. Controlling for firm financial performance and capabilities, we find that analysts were consistently more positive toward the cable firms than toward the wireline telecom firms. Our findings further show that this divergence in reactions arises from differences in existing investor expectations and preferences concerning how firms create value; stocks owned by investors with a greater preference for growth receive more positive reactions than those owned by investors with a greater preference for margins. However, this divergence in reactions shrinks over time as convergence unfolds and as investors shift their shareholdings in response to misalignment between their preferences and firms' strategic changes.

It is in this context that new forms of organizing, such as online groups, have emerged. However, the same factors that underlie the utopian narrative of Internet life also give rise to numerous online groups, many of which fail to attract participants or to provide significant value. This suggests that despite the potential transformative nature of modern information technology, issues of scarcity, competition, and context may remain critical to the performance and functioning of online groups. In this paper, we draw from organizational ecology theories to develop an ecological view of online groups to explain how overlapping membership among online groups causes intergroup competition for member attention and affects a group's ability to grow. Hypotheses regarding the effects of group size, age, and membership overlap on growth are proposed and tested with data from a 64-month, longitudinal sample of 240 online discussion groups. The analysis shows that sharing members with other groups reduced future growth rates, suggesting that membership overlap puts competitive pressure on online groups. Our results also suggest that, compared with smaller and younger groups, larger and older groups experience greater difficulty in growing their membership. In addition, larger groups were more vulnerable to competitive pressure than smaller groups: larger groups experienced greater difficulty in growing their membership than smaller groups as competition intensified. Overall, our findings show how an abundance of opportunities afforded by technologies can create scarcity in user time and effort, which increases competitive pressure on online groups. Our ecological view extends organizational ecology theory to new organizational forms online and highlights the importance of studying the competitive environment of online groups.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0756","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['competition', 'membership', 'growth']","The article primarily focuses on the ecological competition among online groups and does not address social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Mechanisms of Application Segregation in the Market for Managerial Workers","This paper examines differences in the jobs for which men and women apply in order to better understand gender segregation in managerial jobs. We develop and test an integrative theory of why women might apply to different jobs than men. We note that constraints based on gender role socialization may affect three determinants of job applications: how individuals evaluate the rewards provided by different jobs, whether they identify with those jobs, and whether they believe that their applications will be successful. We then develop hypotheses about the role of each of these decision factors in mediating gender differences in job applications. We test these hypotheses using the first direct comparison of how similarly qualified men and women apply to jobs, based on data on the job searches of MBA students. Our findings indicate that women are less likely than men to apply to finance and consulting jobs and are more likely to apply to general management positions. These differences are partly explained by women\u2019s preference for jobs with better anticipated work\u2013life balance, their lower identification with stereotypically masculine jobs, and their lower expectations of job offer success in such stereotypically masculine jobs. We find no evidence that women are less likely to receive job offers in any of the fields studied. These results point to some of the ways in which gender differences can become entrenched through the long-term expectations and assumptions that job candidates carry with them into the application process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['gender segregation', 'job applications', 'work-life balance', 'gender role socialization']","The article addresses gender segregation in managerial roles and explores how societal factors influence job application behaviors, indicating a strong focus on DEI themes.

Less attention has been given to the problem of how new organizations attract collective attention. Although related to legitimation, the problem of attracting attention is distinct, as attention and evaluation are distinct cognitive processes. In this study, we examine the allocation of collective attention to new organizations in a system of relationships, within which new organizations seek to attract attention through their sensegiving activities; the information properties of their sensegiving activities affect the level of attention they receive from different types of media; and media attention, in turn, increases their perceived value potential in the eyes of venture capital investors (VCs). We examine these relationships in a sample of 398 information-technology start-ups that have obtained different levels of venture capital funding. Our results show that new organizations that engage in more intense and diverse sensegiving activities attract higher levels of industry media attention and that these effects are enhanced by the human capital of their founders and leaders. Diverse sensegiving activities are also associated with higher levels of attention from the general media, but only the attention of specialized industry media is positively associated with the level of VC funding obtained. These findings extend current research on information intermediation and institutional legitimation by demonstrating that media attention early in the life of new organizations affects how they are valued by a well-informed expert audience, such as VCs. They also contribute to entrepreneurship research on the effects of new organizations\u2019 strategies on their ability to secure resources and to research on VC funding decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0759","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['diverse', 'attention', 'legitimation', 'media']","The article discusses 'diverse sensegiving activities' and their impact on media attention, which touches on themes of diversity and representation in the context of venture capital funding.

Despite its importance, and despite the many developmental critiques that have appeared over the years, performance continues to be a difficult concept to apply in a scientifically rigorous way. After surfacing three potentially viable approaches for conceptualizing performance, we find that most studies are internally inconsistent in their use of these approaches, a situation that creates substantial difficulty in effectively interpreting research. The primary source of inconsistency lies in the use of a generalized abstract conceptualization of performance in theory building (the latent multidimensional approach) coupled with the adoption of one or two narrow aspects of performance in the empirical work (the separate constructs approach). Follow-up analyses designed to determine the best path for resolving these mismatches indicate that our field\u2019s heavy use of abstract performance in theorizing is not scientifically grounded and should be replaced with more specific aspects of performance to match existing practices in empirical work. Although this change would profoundly affect the field and would be resisted by many, it offers a concrete path away from indefensible practices. We offer several explanations for current practices but emphasize forces related to institutional theory. From an institutional perspective, it appears that firm performance is treated in a general fashion in many areas of our academic lives because it has been embraced as an instrument of legitimacy rather than as a scientific tool that facilitates dialogue and the accumulation of knowledge. We recommend and begin a conversation designed to highlight the long-run dangers of focusing our attention on an abstract concept of performance and suggest a set of specific steps that could help to move all of us in a new direction as we attempt to enhance the scientific rigor of our field.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0762","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['performance', 'institutional theory', 'legitimacy']","The article critiques the abstract conceptualization of firm performance, suggesting a need for more scientifically grounded approaches.

However, two related but distinct explanations exist as to the source of such a discount. One explanation suggests that \u201cactual\u201d skills are degraded when producers attempt to engage across diverse categories. Another explanation involves perceptual fit to category representations held by an audience as the cause. These two explanations tend to be confounded in archival studies because external observers, responsible for the evaluation of market performance, are often aware of both the identity of producers and the underlying characteristics of their products. This leaves researchers unable to empirically separate effects.

We integrate two theories that have been used to explain faultline effects. The first, the approach of Lau and Murnighan [Lau DC, Murnighan JK (1998) Demographic diversity and faultlines: The compositional dynamics of organizational groups. Acad. Management Rev. 23(2):325\u2013340], suggests that in teams with strong faultlines the mechanisms of homophilous selection of interaction partners and persuasive influence cause subgroup polarization, defined as the split of the team into subgroups holding opposing opinions. The second, from sociological and anthropological traditions, emphasizes that crisscrossing actors bridge faultlines because they share demographic attributes with several subgroups. Demographically crisscrossing actors help to prevent polarization in social groups. We argue that Lau and Murnighan\u2019s theory implicitly factors in the effects of crisscrossing actors. However, we show that the authors overlooked crucial implications of their theory because they did not consider crisscrossing actors explicitly. Most importantly, we demonstrate that demographic crisscrossing implies that even teams with strong faultlines will overcome polarization in the long run, although they might suffer from it in the short term. We develop and analyze a formal computational model of the opinion and network dynamics in work teams to show the consistency of our reasoning with Lau and Murnighans\u2019 theory. The model also revealed another counterintuitive effect: strong faultlines lead to structures of interaction that make teams with strong faultlines faster in arriving at a stable consensus than teams with weak faultlines.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0767","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['demographic', 'polarization', 'faultlines', 'diversity']","The article discusses demographic faultlines and their impact on opinion polarization within teams, highlighting themes of diversity and the importance of demographic attributes in bridging divides.

We then employ detailed survey data on a sample of more than 5,000 research-active life scientists and physical scientists to examine key aspects of the framework empirically. Our results suggest that the conflicting logics view tends to overstate differences across sectors while ignoring important heterogeneity within sectors.

Based on unique data on hedge fund foundings between 1979 and 2006, this study documents that past entrepreneurial behaviors of university peers are an important driver of individual rates of entrepreneurship. Additional analyses show that social influence has a stronger effect on the transition to entrepreneurship when exerted by spatially proximate university peers and university peers who share gender with the focal individual. These findings provide evidence that the effect of university peers arises as a result of social influence rather than the institutional impact of universities.

These discontinuities, which often occur at the fringes of an industry, are usually driven by innovative and (often) venture capital-backed start-ups creating new products and transforming existing industries in ways that are difficult for incumbent managers to understand against the backdrop of their existing cognitive schemata. However, failing to appreciate and embrace successful technological discontinuities might endanger incumbents\u2019 very existence. Extending the attention-based view, we explore whether and how interorganizational relationships guide top managers\u2019 attention either to or away from technological discontinuities. We propose that homophilous relationships (e.g., alliances with industry peers) should exhibit a negative relationship with incumbents\u2019 timely attention to technological discontinuities, whereas heterophilous relationships (e.g., with venture capitalists as a result of coinvestments) should exhibit a positive relationship. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the status of the partners strengthens the effect of homophilous and heterophilous relationships with the timely attention of top managers to technological discontinuities. Based on a longitudinal study of the incumbents in four information and communications technology industry sectors, we find that heterophilous ties through corporate venture capital (CVC), coinvesting with high-status venture capital firms, exhibit a strong positive relationship with timely attention. CVC, when it connects senior management to high-status venture capitalists through coinvestments, has a special role in directing top managers\u2019 attention to technological discontinuities and ensuing business opportunities. Implications for the understanding of the role of interorganizational ties as structural determinants of top managers\u2019 attention are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0775","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['technological discontinuities', 'interorganizational relationships', 'venture capital']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of management and organizational behavior related to technological change, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This research, however, has mostly overlooked the fact that interorganizational ties are themselves embedded within larger institutional contexts that can shape the effects of networks on organizational outcomes. We address this gap in the literature by arguing that national institutions affect the extent to which specific network positions, such as brokerage, influence innovation. We explore this idea in the context of corporatism, which fosters an institutional logic of collaboration that influences the broker\u2019s ability to manage its partnerships and recombine the knowledge residing in its network as well as the extent of knowledge flows among network participants.

The expression \u201ctelling our own stories\u201d is used as a proxy for field research projects that, in their written form, explicitly rely on a scholar\u2019s personal involvement in a field. (By personal involvement in a field, I mean a scholar\u2019s engagement in a set of mental activities that connect her to a field.) The assumption is that personal involvement is antithetical to maintaining professional distance. In this paper, I argue that the taboo against telling our own stories stems in part from an epistemological misunderstanding. Learning from the field entails upholding both distance and involvement; the two dimensions should not be conceptualized as opposite ends of a continuum. Moreover, I suggest that the taboo has become too extreme and stifles our collective capacity to generate new insights. To make this argument, I start by discussing the general taboo against telling one\u2019s own stories. Second, I focus on the rationale set forth to justify not only the taboo but also its limitations. Third, I examine what distance entails and how involvement, far from lessening distance, creates opportunities for generating potentially strong theoretical insight. Fourth, I showcase several areas of theoretical development that might benefit from revisiting the taboo. I conclude by reviewing key practical implications of such a shift for our profession and by arguing that organizational scholarship could gain a great deal from relaxing the taboo.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0777","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['personal involvement', 'taboo', 'insights']","The article discusses the importance of personal involvement in scholarly work, challenging traditional norms and taboos in academic research.

We tested the theoretical model with data from 249 employees matched with data from 40 of their coworkers and 40 supervisors employed in a Fortune 500 organization. Results indicate that the relationship between achievement striving and leadership emergence is partially mediated by competitiveness, providing support for a getting-ahead path to leadership. In contrast, the relationship between duty and leadership emergence is, in part, carried forward by trust, helping role perceptions, and helping behavior, supporting a getting-along path to leadership. Consistent with the self versus other distinction theoretically posited with regard to the facets of conscientiousness, although helping behavior is a predictor of leadership emergence, achievement strivers help only when they perceive helping as being an in-role requirement, whereas dutiful individuals enlarge their helping role perceptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0781","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['leadership', 'trust', 'helping behavior']","The article discusses the social construction of leadership and emphasizes the importance of trust and helping behavior in leadership emergence, which aligns with themes of ethical organizational practices and interpersonal dynamics.

We adopt a competition-based view of technological uncertainty to identify an opposite effect in competitive settings: the firm may instead become more specialized when faced with greater technological uncertainty so as to focus on advancing its technologies against competition and influence the resolution of uncertainty in its favor over rivals. We propose that this effect is accentuated when the firm expects that it cannot easily adapt to rivals\u2019 technologies subsequently, specifically when rivals are a greater deterrent through being litigious or innovative.

We then establish that more organizational-level structure is negatively associated with both internal and external learning. We find that psychological safety mediates the positive relationship between team structure and team learning, and that task autonomy constraints mediate the negative relationship between organizational structure and team learning. Investigating the interaction effect between team and organizational structure, we find, unexpectedly, that organizational structure supports external team learning under conditions of less team structure. Specifically, when teams have less team structure, the relationship between organizational structure and external team learning is positive. This structure substitutability finding suggests that although more organizational structure, on average, hurts external team learning, there are situations in which it helps. An important implication of the study is that multiple levels of structure, and their interactions, should be taken into consideration when assessing structural effects on team learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0783","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['psychological safety', 'team learning', 'organizational structure']","The article discusses psychological safety and team learning, which are relevant to DEI themes, but the primary focus remains on structural and organizational factors without a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory."],["2013","24","4","Felipe A.

Although this explanation has been empirically confirmed, it has not been tested comparatively alongside other explanations, most notably rational choice. This lack of comparative study implies that prior research may be committing Type I errors\u2014confirming aspiration-level decision making when it is not actually occurring. This paper contributes to behavioral theory in two specific ways. First, we show that several foundational studies purporting to provide empirical support for aspiration-level decision making may actually represent maximizing behavior. To consider this potential, we simulate a sample of subjectively rational agents who choose strategies by maximizing expectations. We show that it is possible and highly probable to diagnose satisficing when agents are, in fact, maximizing. Second, we develop and implement recommendations for comparative testing to demonstrate reliability. Analysis shows that the recommendations are effective at reducing Type I and II errors for both behavioral theory and rational choice.

Relational Hazards and the Contingent Value of Repeat Exchanges in M&A Markets","I examine the problem of relational hazards between repeat exchange partners and the contingent roles of trade uncertainty and future exchange prospects in moderating the potentially conflicting effects of past exchanges on these hazards, thereby facilitating or restraining the formation of relational embeddedness. On the data of advisory relationships in U.S. mergers and acquisitions from 1981 to 2004, I find that firms that repeatedly hire the same investment banks as financial advisors tend to overpay for acquisition targets, as reflected by negative investor reactions measured in the cumulative abnormal return. In addition, the degree of overpayment increases with the frequency of prior exchanges. This adverse effect of exchange history grows if the uncertainty regarding the target firm rises. However, better prospects for future business with acquiring firms help mitigate this negative effect, although this moderating effect varies across the types of exchange experience. The findings suggest that a potentially complex and nuanced process underlies repeat exchanges, which are an oft-claimed precursor of relational embeddedness, to deliver tangible economic benefits. This study contributes to the emerging literature on the \u201cdark side\u201d of embeddedness and, more broadly, to the sociology of markets and organizations by substantiating the contingency mechanisms that shape the value of a repeat relationship in market exchanges.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0786","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mergers and acquisitions without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Furthermore, we suggest that organizations can play a role in influencing employees\u2019 discrete emotional reactions to the benefit of both employees and the organization. We describe the necessary antecedents for encouraging guilt responses without simultaneously eliciting shame. In essence, employees are more likely to experience guilt (but not shame) if they feel they had control over a specific negative event and the event resulted in a negative outcome for others. Given these necessary preconditions, we identify a set of organizational characteristics\u2014autonomy, specificity of performance feedback, and outcome interdependence\u2014that can be modified to make the experience of guilt more likely than that of shame in the workplace.

Because corporate structure vertically differentiates performance goals and problemistic search, solutions to performance problems vary across corporate and business unit levels, with divergent implications for business unit adaptation. We examine business unit adaptation empirically through new product introductions in the global mobile device industry, finding that poor performance at the business unit level leads to greater new product introductions.

In a comparison of five strategy projects, we observed that organizational participants struggled with competing interpretations of what might emerge in the future, what was currently at stake, and even what had happened in the past. We develop a model of temporal work in strategy making that articulates how actors resolved differences and linked their interpretations of the past, present, and future so as to construct a strategic account that enabled concrete strategic choice and action. We found that settling on a particular account required it to be coherent, plausible, and acceptable; otherwise, breakdowns resulted. Such breakdowns could impede progress, but they could also be generative in provoking a search for new interpretations and possibilities for action. The more intensely actors engaged in temporal work, the more likely the strategies departed from the status quo. Our model suggests that strategy cannot be understood as the product of more or less accurate forecasting without considering the multiple interpretations of present concerns and historical trajectories that help to constitute those forecasts. Projections of the future are always entangled with views of the past and present, and temporal work is the means by which actors construct and reconstruct the connections among them.

In contrast to economic models of commons, which argue that commons occur naturally and are prone to collective inaction and tragedy, we introduce a social constructionist account of commons. Specifically, we show that actor-level frame changes can eventually lead to the emergence of an overarching, hybrid \u201ccommons logic\u201d at the field level. These frame shifts enable actors with different logics to reach a working consensus and avoid \u201ctragedies of the commons.\u201d Using a longitudinal analysis of key actors\u2019 logics and frames, we tracked the evolution of the global climate change field over 40 years.

In conclusion, the emergence of a commons logic in a transnational field is a nonlinear process and involves satisfying three conditions: (1) key actors view their fates as being interconnected with respect to a problem issue, (2) these actors perceive their own behavior as contributing to the problem, and (3) they take collective action to address the problem.

To better understand how small and medium-sized enterprises achieve ambidexterity, we develop theoretical arguments that link organizational performance to strategic combinations of exploration and exploitation in both product and market domains. We test the hypotheses with a longitudinal study in a dynamic industry that combines objective measures of competition, firm size, age, and revenue performance with self-reported measures of product and market exploration and exploitation. The empirical results offer new insights with respect to several tensions at the heart of the ambidexterity challenge: (1) pure strategies that combine product exploration with market exploration or product exploitation with market exploitation have complementary interaction effects on revenue, (2) cross-functional ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration also exerts complementary interaction effects on revenue, (3) product ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for older and larger\u2014but not younger and smaller\u2014firms, and (4) market ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for larger\u2014but not smaller, younger, or older\u2014firms. Two ambidexterity paradoxes emerge: (1) larger, older firms have the resources, capabilities, and experience required to benefit from a product ambidexterity strategy, but larger, older firms are less likely to implement product ambidexterity; and (2) only larger firms have the resources and capabilities required to benefit from a market ambidexterity strategy, but developing and sustaining market ambidexterity is necessary to drive long-term growth.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0790","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['exploration', 'exploitation', 'organizational performance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of strategic ambidexterity in small and medium-sized enterprises without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Companies willing to make use of external resources can now outsource innovation-related tasks to huge \u201ccrowds\u201d outside the company. The extant literature on participation motives assumes a symbiotic relationship between the firm and external contributors in which both parties have largely complementary motives and are only interested in their own utility. In two experimental simulations, we show that this understanding has to be amended: potential contributors not only want a good deal, they also want a fair deal. Fairness expectations with regard to the distribution of value between the firm and contributors (distributive fairness) and the fairness of the procedures leading to this distribution (procedural fairness) impact the likelihood of participation beyond considerations of self-interest. Fairness expectations are formed on the basis of the terms and conditions of the crowdsourcing system and the ex ante level of identification with the firm organizing it. In turn, they impact the individuals\u2019 transaction-specific reactions and also inform their future identification with the firm. These findings contribute not only to research on open and user innovation but also to theories on organizational fairness by enhancing our understanding of the emergent field of fairness expectations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0794","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['fairness', 'distributive fairness', 'procedural fairness', 'participation', 'innovation']","The article emphasizes the importance of fairness in the context of firm innovation, highlighting both distributive and procedural fairness.

This trend is shifting the boundaries of organizations and leading to increased outsourcing. Though the consolidation of volume may lead to productivity improvement, little is known about how this shift toward outsourcing influences learning by providers of outsourced services. When producing output, the content of the knowledge gained can vary from one unit to the next. One dimension along which output can vary\u2014a dimension with particular relevance in outsourcing\u2014is the end customer for whom it is produced. The performance benefits of such customer experience remain largely unexamined. We explore this dimension of volume-based learning in a setting where doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital customers. We examine more than 2.7 million cases read by 97 radiologists for 1,431 customers and find evidence supporting the benefits of customer-specific experience accumulated by individual radiologists. Additionally, we find that variety in an individual\u2019s customer experience may increase the rate of individual learning from customer-specific experience for a focal task. Finally, we find that the level of experience with a customer for the entire outsourcing firm also yields learning and that the degree of customer depth moderates the impact of customer-specific experience at the individual level. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of learning as well as for providers and consumers of outsourced services.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0796","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['outsourcing', 'customer experience', 'learning']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of outsourcing and customer experience without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Religion and the Organizational Sciences","Religion is becoming increasingly salient in and around, but not confined to, the American workplace. The rise of openly faith-based organizations and discourse surrounding the role and importance of spirituality are just a couple of the indicators that religion, in its various guises, is playing a role in organizational life. With few exceptions, however, scholarly research has sidestepped the issue of religion, and, perhaps unwittingly, discourse surrounding spirituality seems to imply that religion is a benign and positive force. Rather than implicitly or explicitly assuming that religion is a benign, positive force in organizations, in this paper, we suggest that organizational scholars need to rigorously address the potential consequences of religion at work in a dispassionate manner that acknowledges both the benefits/adaptive outcomes and the challenges/maladaptive outcomes. Specifically, adopting primarily a psychological approach, we theorize about two fundamental tensions produced by contemplations about religion and the concept of God at work and the conditions under which benefits versus challenges may prevail. These exemplary tensions, virtuousness versus \u201cmore-virtuous-than-thou\u201d and prosociality and ethicality versus egocentrism, highlight the fact that religion has the potential to result in both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes for organizations and their members. Importantly, for each tension, we theorize about the initial conditions under which beneficial/adaptive or challenging/maladaptive outcomes will prevail. We also explore the critical role that the wider context plays in understanding these tensions and how religion affects organizational life.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0797","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['religion', 'spirituality', 'ethicality', 'prosociality', 'organizational life']","The article discusses the role of religion in organizational contexts, addressing both positive and negative outcomes, which aligns with themes of ethics and social dynamics.

Yet such benefits are often accompanied by poor quality resulting from moral hazard, which can be particularly onerous when outsourcing the monitoring and enforcement of government regulation. In this paper, we argue that the considerable moral hazard associated with private regulatory monitoring can be mitigated by understanding conflicts of interest in the monitoring organizations\u2019 product/service portfolios and by the effects of their private governance mechanisms. These organizational characteristics affect the stringency of monitoring through reputation, customer loyalty, differential impacts of government sanctions, and the standardization and internal monitoring of operations. We test our theory in the context of vehicle emissions testing in a state in which the government has outsourced these inspections to the private sector. Analyzing millions of emissions tests, we find empirical support for our hypotheses that particular product portfolios and forms of governance can mitigate moral hazard.

Integrating Theory on Intergroup Behavior","Racial slurs are prevalent in organizations; however, the social context in which racial slurs are exchanged remains poorly understood. To address this limitation, we integrate three intergroup theories (social dominance, gendered prejudice, and social identity) and complement the traditional emphasis on aggressors and targets with an emphasis on observers. In three studies, we test two primary expectations: (1) when racial slurs are exchanged, whites will act in a manner more consistent with social dominance than blacks; and (2) this difference will be greater for white and black men than for white and black women. In a survey (n = 471), we show that whites are less likely to be targets of racial slurs and are more likely to target blacks than blacks are to target them. We also show that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In an archival study that spans five years (n = 2,480), we found that white men are more likely to observe racial slurs than are black men, and that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In a behavioral study (n = 133), analyses showed that whites who observe racial slurs are more likely to remain silent than blacks who observe slurs. We also find that social dominance orientation (SDO) predicts observer silence and that racial identification enhances the effect of race on SDO for men, but not for women. Further, mediated moderation analyses show that SDO mediates the effect of the interaction between race, gender, and racial identification on observer silence.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0809","","OS","Management & Organizations","9","['racial slurs', 'social dominance', 'intergroup behavior', 'prejudice', 'observer silence']","The article focuses on the prevalence of racial slurs in the workplace and integrates theories related to social dominance and prejudice, emphasizing the social dynamics of race and gender.

This enables the core business to shift productivity gains toward itself from the segment, which could lead to various inefficiencies within the related diversified firm. Using input/output flow data and a multilevel model with the segment as the unit of analysis, I first show that a segment\u2019s productivity is lower compared with a single-business firm when it shares backward and forward complementarity (i.e., when it shares transactions with common suppliers and customers) with the core business. Correspondingly, I show that as a mirror image, the core business\u2019s productivity is enhanced when the business shares backward and forward complementarity with segments and when segments are backward integrated with it (i.e., when the core business provides outputs to segments). These shifts in productivity and the attendant inefficiencies do not seem to be destroying the entire value from related diversification.

Boundary Negotiation and Identity Formation in Postmerger Integration","This research investigates how boundaries are utilized during the postmerger integration process to influence the postmerger identity of the firm. We suggest that the boundaries that define the structures, practices, and values of firms prior to a merger become reinforced, contested, or revised in the integration process, thus shaping the firm identity that emerges. In a field study of a series of four sequential mergers, we find that the boundary negotiation process acts as an engine for identity creation in postmerger integration. Our analysis of the process through which postmerger identity is created reveals two stages of identity creation. In the first stage, boundaries are negotiated to leverage and import certain practices and values of the premerger firms; in the second stage, these boundaries are blurred as managers build on the set of imported practices and values to impose further systems that define the postintegration firm. Our research contributes to the identity literature by drawing attention to the important role of boundaries and practices that define the identities of the merging firms. We show how these boundaries get repurposed to create an organization whose identity ultimately represents a departure from the premerger firms while it preserves the aspects of identity that allow members to uphold key values. We also contribute to the literature on postmerger integration by demonstrating the steps through which identity evolves by the staged demarcation and negotiation of boundaries, thus complementing previous treatments of merging firms as a set of fixed organizational attributes in merger contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0814","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'boundaries', 'values', 'practices']","The article discusses the negotiation of boundaries and the evolution of organizational identity, which touches on themes of values and practices that can relate to diversity and inclusion in the context of mergers.

Entrepreneurs create new profit opportunities by recombining existing assets into novel combinations based on their subjective judgment under conditions of uncertainty. In doing so, they become vulnerable to ex post appropriation by owners of uniquely complementary assets, especially where ex ante uncertainty translates into ex post causal ambiguity. Firms are a means by which entrepreneurs overcome this problem, maximizing the appropriation of pure profits from their actions. The paper formalizes this insight in an integrative model of entrepreneurial governance choice, highlighting the trade-off between the risk of appropriation and the incremental cost of asset ownership. Comparative statics from this model provide predictions about the conditions under which hierarchical governance will be preferred. In particular, they suggest that firms are preferred where entrepreneurial action results in the creation of combinations of assets that are rare, valuable, and difficult to imitate (i.e., the creation of strategic capabilities). The paper thus contributes to work on the dynamics of capabilities and transaction costs, highlighting the structurally uncertain nature of capability creation and its implications for the theory of the firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0817","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational boundary choices and profit appropriation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

An inductive study of the rise of Cubism, a revolutionary paradigm that overthrew classic principles of representation in art, results in a model where not only the periphery moves toward the core through collective action, as typically asserted, but the core also moves toward the periphery, becoming more receptive to radical ideas. The fragmentation of the art market in early 20th-century Paris served as the trigger. The proliferation of market niches and growing ambiguity over evaluation standards dramatically reduced the costs of experimentation in the periphery and the ability of the core to suppress radical ideas. A multilevel analysis linking individual creativity, peer networks, and the art field reveals how market developments fostered Spanish Cubist Pablo Picasso\u2019s experiments and facilitated their diffusion in the absence of public support, a coherent movement, and even his active involvement.

Although knowledge stocks in the different loci accumulate over time in day-to-day firm activities, empirical results suggest that the individual is the primary repository of innovative capability and that experience working together in teams has a secondary influence on productivity. Contrary to prior learning curve research, accumulated firm experience has no direct effect on productivity. However, when individuals possess relevant domain knowledge and have experience working together, they benefit from knowledge spillovers within the firm. This suggests that knowledge stocks in the different loci are complementary to one another and that the comingling of these disparate bins of knowledge is an important facet of innovative capability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2013.0821","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'capability', 'teams']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of innovation and productivity without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Employing a quasi-natural experiment, I find that focal Norwegian firms are more likely to make responsible cross-border investments following the formation of the Council on Ethics in 2004 and its associated censorship announcements. Further, I find that the normative pressure for responsible investments is mediated by firms\u2019 imitation or overlap with the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund\u2019s investments. However, the mediated effect of normative pressure on responsible investments becomes weaker for government-owned firms. These findings highlight the importance of normative mechanisms through which government can influence firms\u2019 behavior, especially in contexts where regulatory authority may not hold.

We posit that different types of uncertainty differentially affect this observational learning process; in particular, we propose that certain uncertainty types attenuate (rather than foster) observational learning and subsequent imitation. We test this theory using a 29-year panel data set on the exit of private venture capital firms. Our results indicate that observational learning does influence imitation in firm exit decisions, and they also suggest that a common belief\u2014that uncertainty enhances imitation\u2014does not apply to all types of uncertainty. Specifically, we find that uncertainty fosters imitation only when it is idiosyncratic to the firm; uncertainties that are common to all firms, in contrast, actually reduce reliance on observational learning.

The two parties can engage in one of three Cournot competition games: a simultaneous game, a sequential game with the OEM as the Stackelberg leader, and a sequential game with the CM as the Stackelberg leader. On the basis of these three basic games, this study investigates the two parties' Stackelberg leadership/followership decisions. When the outsourcing quantity and wholesale price are exogenously given, either party may prefer Stackelberg leadership or followership. For example, when the wholesale price or the proportion of production outsourced to the CM is lower than a threshold value, both parties prefer Stackelberg leadership and, consequently, play a simultaneous game in the consumer market. When the outsourcing quantity and wholesale price are decision variables, the competitive CM sets a wholesale price sufficiently low to allow both parties to coexist in the market, and the OEM outsources its entire production to this CM. This study also examines the impact of the supply chain parties' bargaining power on contract outcomes by considering a wholesale price that is determined via the generalized Nash bargaining scheme, finding a Stackelberg equilibrium to be sustained when the CM's degree of bargaining power is great and the non\u2010competitive CM's wholesale price is high.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01336.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and competitive strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

With restoration capability, if disruption occurs, additional costly effort can be exerted to rebuild capacity, although its outcome is uncertain. We study how a firm (buyer) can use incentive mechanisms to motivate a supplier's investment in capacity restoration, and compare this approach with the traditional approach of diversifying part of the order to an expensive but reliable supplier. Under a Restoration Enhancement (RE) strategy, the buyer uses price and/or order quantity incentives to encourage the supplier's restoration investment decision. Two different cases are considered\u2014when the incentive is committed to ex ante (prior to disruption) and when it is committed to ex post (after disruption). In contrast, under a Supplier Diversification (SD) strategy, the buyer splits orders between a reliable supplier and an unreliable\u00a0supplier to hedge against the disruption risk. Here, the buyer does not provide any separate incentive to the unreliable supplier. Our analysis indicates that under the RE strategy, where the buyer offers incentives, both the buyer and the supplier (weakly) prefer the ex ante commitment over the ex post one. Furthermore, the RE strategy is preferred over the SD strategy when the unreliable supplier's restoration outcome is more predictable or when a high restoration outcome is more likely.

For a large network our 2PC procedure runs under 70 seconds to come within 0.02% of the CDLP value, while column generation takes around 1 hour; for an even larger network with 68 legs, column generation does not converge even in 10 hours for most of the scenarios while 2PC runs under 9 minutes. Thus we believe our approach is very promising for quickly approximating CDLP when segment consideration sets overlap and the consideration sets themselves are relatively small.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01345.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of revenue management and optimization techniques without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Successful engagement in after\u2010sales service improves customer loyalty and allows for competitive differentiation through superior service like an extended service period during which customers are guaranteed to be provided with service parts. Inventory management during this period is challenging due to the substantial uncertainty concerning demand over a long time horizon. The traditional mechanism of spare parts acquisition is to place a large final order at the end of regular production of the parent product, causing major holding costs and a high level of obsolescence risk. With an increasing length of the service period, more flexibility is needed and can be provided by adding options like extra production and remanufacturing. However, coordinating all three options yields a complicated stochastic dynamic decision problem. For that problem type, we show that a quite simple decision rule with order\u2010up\u2010to levels for extra production and remanufacturing is very effective. We propose a heuristic procedure for parameter determination which accounts for the main stochastic and dynamic interactions in decision making, but still consists of relatively simple calculations that can be applied to practical problem sizes. A numerical study reveals that the heuristic performs extremely well under a wide range of conditions, and therefore can be strongly recommended as a decision support tool for the multi\u2010option spare parts procurement problem. A comparison with decision rules adapted from practice demonstrates that our approach offers an opportunity for major cost reductions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01358.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost reduction without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In practice, most manufacturers distribute a line of products with different features and qualities and not just a single product. Consider a manufacturer who distributes a product line through competing downstream retailers. In this setting, we investigate how and why the retailers' price and inventory decisions deviate from the centrally optimal decisions. Due to substitution between different product variants, as well as between different retailers, the incentive problems associated with distributing a product line are more complicated than that of distributing a single product. We characterize retailers' incentive distortions under a residual\u2010claimancy contract, and construct contracts that achieve channel coordination. We show that retail price floors or inventory buybacks, appropriately tailored to each product variant, are among the contracts that can achieve coordination.

When the sum of the retailer orders exceeds the capacity, the supplier allocates her capacity according to a pre\u2010announced allocation mechanism. Two mechanisms are considered: proportional allocation and lexicographic allocation. An extensive study of the two allocation mechanisms shows that the lexicographic mechanism has the ability to dampen the competition at the retail level, increasing the profits for both the supplier and the supply chain.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01373.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We use externally validated quality certification and quality awards as proxies for QMS and TQM, respectively, as it is difficult to directly measure the QMS and TQM efforts of firms. We use an unbalanced panel of 220 firms and a balanced panel of 73 firms from the Indian auto component industry over the period 1993\u20132006 to study these links. Both parametric as well as non\u2010parametric approaches are used, as appropriate, to measure the rate of change in productivity and the impact of quality initiatives on productivity change during this period. We determine the proportion of productivity resulting from technical change and relative efficiency change, thus providing insights into the structure of productivity improvements. We find that TQM efforts resulted in a high rate of productivity change (11%) in the award\u2010winning firms after the award. On the other hand, pre\u2010certification productivity change due to QMS was 5% and post\u2010certification change was 3.6%. In the periods prior to certification, productivity change was driven mainly by technical change; whereas the source of productivity change after certification is mixed. However, prior to awards, productivity change was driven mainly by relative efficiency change, whereas post\u2010award productivity change was due to technical change. The results suggest that management focus on attaining certification did generate conceptual learning (linked to technical change) during the period leading to certification, but these effects were not significant after certification. The results also suggest that the TQM programs generated significant productivity gains in the long run, although setting the associated systems in place did not result in significant productivity change prior to winning awards. Thus, the study provides direct but nuanced evidence linking quality certification as well as the adoption of TQM programs to the associated conceptual and operational learning processes and their impact on the change in productivity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12000","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of quality management systems and productivity without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Use of a common base platform and modular design approach allows a firm to offer updates for improved performance and flexibility via remanufacturing when products have multiple lifecycles. However, as the product evolves through multiple lifecycles, the large pool of product variants leads to the curse of product proliferation. In practice, product proliferation causes high levels of line congestion and results in longer lead times, higher inventory levels, and lower levels of customer service. To offer insights into the product proliferation problem, the authors employ a delayed differentiation model in a multiple lifecycle context. The delayed differentiation model gives flexibility to balance trade\u2010offs between disassembly and reassembly costs by adaptively changing the push\u2010pull boundary. An adaptive, evolving push\u2010pull boundary provides flexibility for a remanufacturing firm to meet changing customer demands. The delayed differentiation model includes both a mixed\u2010integer linear program and an analytical investigation of the evolutionary nature of the push\u2010pull boundary. Both field observations and experimental results show that the nature of product proliferation and changing demand structures play significant roles in the cost and flexibility of the evolving delayed differentiation system.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01370.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product design and operational efficiency without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2013","22","3","Joseph A.

As a result, the scope of supply chain related operations have increasingly cut across organizational boundaries. To understand and capture such cross\u2010organizational activities, researchers have broadened the focus of their studies and included multiple stakeholders in their analysis (e.g., integration, sustainability, and buyer\u2010supplier relationships). However, multi\u2010stakeholder research has also increased the complexity and effort required to conduct studies across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, many studies that use multi\u2010stakeholder constructs fail to fully address their multi\u2010sided nature during both construct conceptualization and data collection. Several studies suggest that neglecting the multi\u2010sided nature of certain constructs can affect the research validity and reliability and may invalidate research inferences and results, although such concerns have not been empirically demonstrated. The current study addresses this gap by performing a series of tests using data from 105 matched pairs of buyers and their suppliers to illustrate key methodological considerations for conducting multi\u2010stakeholder research. This study also offers practical guidance regarding assumptions routinely made in single rater research and proposes when single rater data may be appropriate for multi\u2010stakeholder research.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01371.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['stakeholder', 'sustainability', 'multi\u2010stakeholder']","The article discusses multi-stakeholder research and sustainability, which indicates some awareness of broader social impacts.

In particular, we show that when the resources are limited, the firm should offer only the product that has the highest margin per unit capacity. We find that this product could be the diametrically opposite product suggested by the existing literature.

Using a newsvendor framework, we examine this problem by focusing on the operational factor: how product availability induces strategic customers to voluntarily provide advance demand information. We find that a strong Nash equilibrium exists where every customer is willing to click, and customer incentives to click are robust to noise. Hence, we demonstrate the promise of strategic customer behavior in the context of click tracking, contrary to the conventional wisdom that it is typically a peril for the firm. Notably, click tracking is typically advantageous to both the firm and its customers, compared with other strategies such as advance selling, quantity commitment, availability guarantees, and quick response.

Many retailers actively decide whether or not to encourage negotiation on the shop floor. Of course, the retailer's pricing policy influences not only the retailer's profit, but also the profits of the manufacturers who sell through the retailer. However, little is known about the forces that shape the pricing policy when two self\u2010interested parties interact in a supply chain. We consider two alternative models depending on who has the power to decide the pricing policy: the manufacturer or the retailer. We find that an increase in the wholesale price weakens the retailer's ability to price discriminate through negotiation. Therefore, the retailer prefers negotiation at lower wholesale prices and posted pricing at higher wholesale prices. We also find that whenever the retailer prefers negotiation, the manufacturer does too. Therefore, the retailer's discretion over the pricing policy causes friction only when the retailer wants to use posted pricing, while the manufacturer wishes the retailer to use negotiation. We show that such friction arises only when product availability or the cost of negotiation is moderate. In this case, we show that the manufacturer may offer a substantial discount to persuade the retailer to negotiate. Surprisingly, in this region of friction, a decrease in the supply chain's capacity or an increase in negotiation costs (both of which are typically considered as worsening the retailer's business environment) translates into higher profit for the retailer.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01412.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing policy in supply chains without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Prior to market entry, the supplier performs process design activities, which improve manufacturing yield and the chances of getting qualified for the customer's product. However, a long delay in market entry allows competitors to enter the market and pass the customer's qualification process before the supplier, reducing the supplier's share of the customer's business. After entering the market and if qualified, the supplier also needs to decide how much to produce for a finite planning horizon by considering several factors such as manufacturing yield and stochastic demand, both of which depend on the earlier time\u2010to\u2010market decision. To capture this dependency, we develop a sequential, nested, two\u2010stage decision framework to optimize the time\u2010to\u2010market and production decisions in relation to each other. We show that the supplier's optimal market entry and qualification timing decision need to be revised in real time based on the number of qualified competitors at the time of market\u2010entry decision. We establish the optimality of a threshold policy. Following this policy, at the beginning of each decision epoch, the supplier should optimally stop preparing for qualification and decide whether to enter the market if her order among qualified competitors exceeds a predetermined threshold. We also prove that the supplier's optimal production policy is a state\u2010dependent, base\u2010stock policy, which depends on the time\u2010to\u2010market and qualification decisions. The proposed framework also enables a firm to quantify how market conditions (such as price and competitor entry behavior) and operating conditions (such as the rate of learning and inventory/production\u2010related costs) affect time\u2010to\u2010market strategy and post\u2010entry production decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01413.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing production and market entry strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The manufacturers in the Stackelberg game possess a Stackelberg\u2010leader advantage in that the retailers are not entitled to make counteroffers. Our analysis suggests that whether this advantage would benefit the manufacturers depends on the contractual form. With simple contracts such as wholesale\u2010price contracts, which generally do not allow one party to fully extract the trade surplus, the Stackelberg game replicates the boundary case of the bargaining game with the manufacturers possessing all the bargaining power. In contrast, with sophisticated contracts such as two\u2010part tariffs, which enable full surplus extraction, the two games lead to distinct outcomes. We further show that the game structure being Stackelberg or bargaining critically affects firms' preferences over contract types and thus their equilibrium contract choices.

The latter group has no consumption value for the goods and is in the market with the sole objective of making a profit by reselling the purchased goods shortly after. Consumers, although homogeneous in terms of their valuations, are different with respect to their perspectives. We show that in an \u201cupward\u201d market where the expected valuation increases over time, the optimal pricing policy is an ex ante \u201cstatic\u201d one where the seller \u201cprices into the future\u201d and prices the myopic consumers out of the advance market. However, in a \u201cdownward\u201d market where the expected valuation decreases over time, the seller adopts a dynamic pricing strategy except for the case when higher initial sales can trigger more demand subsequently and when the downward trend is not too high. In this case, the seller prefers an ex ante \u201cstatic\u201d pricing strategy and deliberately prices lower initially to sell to speculators. We identify the conditions under which the seller benefits from the existence of speculators in the market.

We consider three general forms of product recovery: (i) when product recovery reuses (after reprocessing) quality inducing components or material (e.g., remanufacturing), (ii) when product recovery does not reuse quality inducing components or material but it is overall profitable (e.g., cell phone recycling), and (iii) when product recovery is costly (but mandated by legislation, e.g., recycling of small appliances in the European Union). Using a stylized economic model, we show that the form of product recovery, recovery cost structure, and the presence of product take\u2010back legislation play an important role in quality choice. Generally speaking, product recovery increases the firm's quality choice, except for some instances of recovery form (ii). In addition, we find that product take\u2010back legislation can lead to higher quality choice as opposed to voluntary take\u2010back. We further demonstrate that both the firm and the consumers benefit from recovery form (ii), while both are worse off with recovery form (iii). However, environmental implications of the three recovery modes differ from their impact on consumer surplus and firm profit. While recovery forms (i) and (iii) reduce consumption and increase environmental benefits, the same is not true with recovery form (ii), which can increase consumption, potentially resulting in higher environmental impact.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01290.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['environmental implications', 'product recovery', 'legislation']","The article discusses the environmental implications of product recovery and the role of legislation in influencing quality choices, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical considerations in operations management.

Record inaccuracies are assumed to arrive via an error process that perturbs physical inventory but is unobserved by the inventory manager. The inventory manager maintains a probability distribution around the physical inventory level that he updates based on sales observations using Bayes Theorem. The focus of this study is on understanding, approximating, and evaluating optimal forward\u2010looking replenishment in this environment. By analyzing one\u2010 and two\u2010period versions of the problem, we demonstrate several mechanisms by which the error process and associated record inaccuracy can impact optimal replenishment. Record inaccuracy generally brings an incentive for a myopic manager to increase stock to buffer the added uncertainty. On the other hand, a forward\u2010looking manager will stock less than a myopic manager, in part to improve information content for future decisions. Using an approximate partially observed dynamic programming policy and associated bound, we numerically corroborate our analytical findings and measure the effectiveness of an intelligent myopic heuristic. We find that the myopic heuristic is likely sufficiently good in practical settings targeting high service levels.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01305.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Tale of Two Price Partitioning Strategies in Online\n                        Retailing","In this article, we study the price partitioning decisions of online retailers regarding shipping and handling (S&H) fees. Specifically, we analyze two partitioning formats used by retailers in this context. In the first scenario, retailers present customers with a price that is partitioned into a product price and a separate S&H surcharge (the PS strategy); in the second, customers are offered free shipping through a non\u2010partitioned format where the product price already includes the shipping cost (the ZS strategy). We first develop a stylized game\u2010theoretic model that captures the competitive dynamics between (and within) these two formats. Analysis of the model provides insights into how both firm and product level characteristics drive a retailer's strategic choice regarding which partitioning format to adopt and, hence, determines the equilibrium market structure in terms of proportion of ZS and PS retailers. Subsequently, we conduct empirical analyses, based on product and S&H prices data for two different product categories (digital cameras and printers) collected from online retailers, to validate all the results of our theoretical model. We establish that PS retailers charge lower product prices than ZS ones, but the total price (product + S&H) charged is higher for the first group. The S&H charge for PS retailers can be significant\u2014it is, on average, 5.4% (printers) and 3.0% (digital cameras) for our two product categories. Furthermore, retailers which are popular and/or face risky cost environment are more likely to opt for the ZS strategy, while retailers whose portfolio mostly includes large or heavy products with high cost (S&H)\u2010to\u2010price ratios usually choose the PS strategy. Lastly, our empirical study also illustrates that the price adjustment behavior of retailers is affected by their shipping\u2010fee policies\u2014for example, ZS retailers change their product prices almost 1.5 times more frequently than PS ones.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2012.01391.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies in online retailing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider a two\u2010stage game where retailers first decide whether to invest in improvements in customer valuation and then engage in price competition. We computationally explore the Nash equilibria in terms of both investment and pricing.

Next, we focus on the pricing game and theoretically characterize the pricing Nash equilibrium. We find that a retailer could overcome competitive effects by improving consumer valuation beyond a certain threshold. We also find that a retailer who does not invest could benefit from competition in situations where his competitor increases consumer valuation beyond a threshold.

This misalignment results from the fragmented nature of inventory policy decision making in the retail industry and affects basic trade\u2010offs in inventory models. We specify conditions under which the BRE exists, quantify the expected amount of backroom inventory, derive an optimal short\u2010term inventory policy, and assess the impact of the BRE on the optimal inventory policy and total costs.

The retailer either salvages returned products or resells them as open\u2010box items at a discount. We develop a model in which the retailer decides on the quantity to procure, the price for new products, the refund amount, as well as the price of returned products when they are sold as open\u2010box. Our model captures important features of MBG sales including demand uncertainty, consumer valuation uncertainty, consumer returns, the sale of returned products as open\u2010box items, and consumer choice between new and returned products and possibility of exchanges when restocking is considered. We show that selling with MBGs increases retail sales and profit. Furthermore, the second\u2010sale opportunity created by restocking returned products enables the retailer to generate additional revenues. Our analysis identifies the ideal conditions under which this practice is most beneficial to the retailer. Offering an MBG without restocking increases the new product price. We show that if the retailer decides to resell the returned items as open\u2010box, the price of the new product further increases, while open\u2010box items are sold at a discount. On the other hand, customers enjoy more generous refunds along with lower restocking fees. The opportunity to resell returned products also generally decreases the initial stocking levels of the retailer.

Thus, inventory durability and transit lags cause managers to deviate from inventory decision optimality. Durability creates a large increase in order volatility because players adjust orders insufficiently to reflect current inventory and backlogs, much as they adjust orders insufficiently to reflect holding and backlog costs in newsvendor studies (e.g., Schweitzer and Cachon 2000). Transit lags exacerbate non\u2010optimal ordering by interfering with players' ability to correct prior errors. Our results suggest that non\u2010optimal inventory decisions can be driven by inventory and supply chain characteristics, even in the absence of the coordination and information sharing problems studied by Croson et\u00a0al.

In this study, we analyze the optimal decisions of a firm when a substance within its product is identified as potentially hazardous. Although the substance is not currently regulated, regulation may occur in the future. Therefore, the firm must devise a strategy for the development and implementation of a replacement substance. In an environment where replacement costs can be millions of dollars, regulation is uncertain, and both consumer and non\u2010governmental organization pressures exist, a carefully developed plan that balances costs and risks is critical for a firm. Our results demonstrate that as long as a threat of regulation exists, a firm should always dedicate resources toward developing a replacement substance. However, it is not always optimal for a firm to implement a developed replacement. Regarding competitive dynamics, we find that competition between firms can offset a low chance of a shift in consumer perception about a substance and compel firms to replace; however, competition can lead to inefficient outcomes in which firms incur avoidable costs to implement ahead of potential regulation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12021","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['environmental impact', 'hazardous', 'regulation', 'consumer pressure']","The article addresses the environmental impact of potentially hazardous substances and the pressures from consumers and NGOs, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in business operations.

We use the structure of the multinomial logit model to formulate an equivalent nonlinear program, where the number of decision variables is manageable and the objective function is separable. Exploiting separability, we solve the equivalent nonlinear program through a dynamic program with a two dimensional and continuous state variable.

Thus, retailers are both wholesale customers and retail competitors of many manufacturers. The consequences of the rapid emergence of instances of such partial forward integration by suppliers are not yet fully known. To this end, we study how partial forward integration can affect competing firms' strategic investments. We find that integration shifts the environment from being one in which firms invest to undercut retail rivals to one in which firms invest more in boosting demand, even that of their competitors. A case in point is the tendency for a manufacturer to invest broadly in brand promotion (benefiting both itself and its retail competitor), rather than heavy promotion of its own sales channel.

Unlike the dedicated server case, we find that a bottleneck may span several nodes in the network. We then identify some characteristics of desirable flexibility structures. In particular, the chosen flexibility structure should not only achieve the maximal possible capacity (corresponding to full server flexibility), but should also have the feature that the entire network is the (unique) system bottleneck. The reason is that it is then possible to shift capacity between arbitrary nodes in the network, allowing the network to cope with demand fluctuations.

For the regulator, we compare the social welfare achievable in the centralized system (which serves as an upper bound) to the highest level achievable under different classes of environmental policies. If the regulator is limited to a tax\u2010only policy, then when the regulator is moderately concerned with environmental impacts, the tax level that maximizes social welfare simultaneously motivates the choice of clean technology and closes the gap to the upper bound; however, both low and high levels of societal environmental concerns may lead to the choice of dirty technology and significant welfare losses as compared to the centralized case. Supplementing the environmental taxation with fixed cost subsidies and consumer rebates can eliminate this effect, expanding the range of parameters over which the green technology is chosen and often closing the welfare gap to the centralized solution.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12023","research article","POM","Operations Management","7","['environmental', 'green technology', 'social welfare', 'emissions control']","The article emphasizes the role of environmental taxes in promoting green technology and discusses social welfare implications, which aligns with sustainability and ethical considerations in business practices.

In this study, we attempt to further understand the strategic impact of low\u2010cost outsourcing on manufacturers' profitability by investigating the contractual form of outsourcing agreements and the industry structure of the upstream supply market. We consider a two\u2010tier supply chain system, consisting of two competing manufacturers, who have the option to produce in\u2010house or to outsource to an upstream supplier with lower cost. To reach an outsourcing agreement, each manufacturer engages in bilateral negotiation with her supplier, who may be an exclusive supplier or a common supplier serving both manufacturers. Our analysis shows that wholesale\u2010price contracts always mitigate the competition between manufacturers regardless of whether they compete with price or quantity. In contrast, two\u2010part tariffs intensify the competition when the manufacturers compete with quantity, but soften it when they compete with price. As a result, when outsourcing with two\u2010part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn lower profits than they would from in\u2010house production, although the suppliers are more cost efficient. This suggests that managers have to be wary about the downside of using coordinating contracts such as two\u2010part tariffs when pursuing low\u2010cost outsourcing strategies. Our analysis also sheds some light on the profitability of using an exclusive supplier for outsourcing. When outsourcing with wholesale\u2010price contracts, the competing manufacturers are better off outsourcing to an exclusive supplier. However, when outsourcing with two\u2010part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn higher profits by outsourcing to a common supplier than to an exclusive one when the manufacturers' bargaining power is sufficiently strong (weak) under quantity (price) competition.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12026","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract negotiation and profitability in outsourcing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

They compare performance during a period against a contracted service level and penalize outcomes exceeding some allowed deviation. SLAs have a number of design characteristics that need careful tuning to ensure that incentives are properly aligned. However, there is little theoretical research in this area. Using an example of an SLA for outsourcing inventory management, we make a number of recommendations. First it is preferable, if possible, that penalties be proportional to the underperformance rather than lump\u2010sum ones. This goes a long way towards mitigating strategic (\u201cgaming\u201d) behavior by the supplier. Second, it might be thought that giving \u201cbonuses for good performance\u201d rather than \u201cpenalties for bad performance\u201d are essentially identical apart from the former being a more positive approach to management. This turns out to be incorrect in the case of large percentage service rate targets and that penalties will normally be preferred by the buying firm. Third, in order not to incorrectly penalize underperformance resulting purely from \u201cnoise\u201d rather than supplier efforts, management might think it best to make allowed deviations from the target generous. Again intuition is not a helpful guide here: for proportional penalties, acceptable performance deviations should be close to the target.

This study explores the development of 17 ventures that cooperated with a university\u2010owner of technology and thereby identifies different cooperation patterns in which fairness perceptions influence the degree of cooperation. These perceptions also change over time, partly as a function of accumulated experience and learning. A system dynamics model integrates insights from existing literature with the empirical findings to reveal which cooperation mechanisms relate to venture development over time; the combinations of individual experience, fairness perceptions, and market circumstances lead to four different patterns. This model can explain changes in entrepreneurial cooperation as a result of changes in fairness perceptions, which depend on learning effects and entrepreneurial experience.

However, when expanding the product line carries substantial fixed costs (e.g., marketing cost, cost of additional plant, increased distribution cost), then the uncertainty in developer participation adversely impacts the firm's ability to offer multiple versions. We show that for established firms with lower uncertainty about developer participation, the choice is essentially between an expanded or minimal product line.

Building on agency theory and extant QM literature, this study addresses two research questions: (i) whether the control mechanisms of quality audits and contractual external quality failure penalties are substitutes or complements in use and (ii) whether they are substitutes or complements in their effectiveness at aligning the quality interests of customers and their CMs. Our analysis uses dyadic data gathered from brand\u2010owning firms and their CMs representing 95 contract manufacturing relationships in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010regulated industries. The results indicate that more severe external failure penalties correspond to a lower use of facility audits (i.e., they are substitutes\u2010in\u2010use). We also find that both external failure penalties and facility audits have a unique positive effect on the CM's perception of relative quality importance.

The entrepreneurship literature suggests that startups should pursue focused strategies for various reasons, including bounded rationality and budget constraints, but generally overlooks startups entering markets with complementary technologies. The advice for mature firms investing in complementary technologies is often to diversify investment across multiple complements to manage technological uncertainty. Given competing guidance, we seek to extend the entrepreneurship literature by modeling startups' entry decisions for markets in which complementary technologies exhibit strong learning effects. We find that, consistent with the extant entrepreneurship literature, startups generally achieve higher expected returns by channeling their integration investment to only one complementary technology. However, the mechanisms driving our results differ significantly by hinging on nonlinear feedback effects that occur when firms concentrate integration investment in only one complementary technology.

On the basis of operations management and entrepreneurship literature, we develop a contingency framework of operational capabilities especially appropriate at different life phases of a new venture's evolution. We expect that in the first years of a new venture's life, entrepreneurs should emphasize high inventory turnover to preserve working capital, support customer responsiveness, and aid firm adaptability. As new ventures grow, entrepreneurs should emphasize internal working capital generation via larger gross margins to support production ramp\u2010up. Later, new venture entrepreneurs should emphasize employee productivity to buttress sustainable volume production. We analyze a 6\u2010year longitudinal sample of 812 Swedish manufacturing new ventures using a gamma frailty\u2010based Cox regression. The findings show that specific operational capabilities, while always supporting new venture survival, have exceptional influence in specific new venture life phases.

While there exist several studies (and modeling applications) for work distribution and allocation for manufacturing and supply chain networks, those related to product development organizations are limited to qualitative suggestions such as offshoring of modular tasks. However, most PD efforts are characterized by significant complexity in information sharing and information dependency among PD tasks (represented by coupling in the system architecture of the firm), thus preventing the identification of modular tasks. Also, redesigning the architecture to introduce modularity has associated risks of costs and product integrity. We demonstrate a methodology to organize work distribution globally in an industrial setting, utilizing the design structure matrix to quantify the system architecture of the firm. Our optimization results show significant cost savings through a restructured PD organization. On analysis of the results, we make two significant observations: (a) while offshoring based on modularity is generally appropriate, it is not the whole answer, as there exists a trade\u2010off between the efficiency of performing specific PD tasks at the offshore location and the modularity of the task; and (b) firms should successively increase work allocation to the offshore location, benefiting from capability improvements through learning effects.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12045","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['global', 'work distribution', 'efficiency', 'offshoring']","The article primarily focuses on optimizing work distribution and cost savings in product development without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical implications.

Under q-theory, managers optimally adjust the supply of assets to changes in their market value. The first-order condition of investment then provides a valuation equation that infers asset prices from managers' costs of supplying the assets. This equation fits well the Tobin's q levels across many testing assets, including portfolios formed on q. With current investment-to-capital as the only input, the supply approach does not require cash flow forecasts or discount rate estimates, both of which are notoriously difficult to obtain in practice.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/12/3029/1588576","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for equity valuation without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

This paper rationalizes these cross-market differences in the risk-return relationship for housing, and in so doing, explains the puzzling negative relationship. The paper shows that when the current house provides a hedge against the risk associated with the future housing consumption, households are willing to accept a lower return to compensate for risk, thus weakening the positive risk-return relationship. Further, in markets with less elastic housing supply and a growing population, hedging incentives can be sufficiently strong to make the relationship negative. The empirical analysis confirms these predictions, suggesting that hedging incentives, housing supply, and urban growth are indeed central to understanding the risk-return relationship for housing.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/4/877/1599250","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of risk and return in housing markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In equilibrium, some investors trade on their own account, but others decide to delegate trading to professional fund managers. Flow-performance incentive functions describe how much capital clients provide to funds at each date as a function of past performance. Convex flow-performance relations imply that the average fund outperforms the market in recessions and underperforms in expansions. When the share of capital that is delegated is low, all funds follow the same strategy. However, when the equilibrium share of delegated capital is high, funds with identical incentives employ heterogeneous trading strategies. A group of managers borrows to take on a levered position on the stock. Thus, fund returns are dispersed in the cross-section and the outstanding amounts of borrowing and lending increase. The relation between the share of delegated capital and the Sharpe ratio typically follows an inverse U-shaped pattern.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/4/929/1599011","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the effects of delegated capital in trading strategies and equilibrium prices, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes."],["2013","26","4","Jonathan B.

Momentum profits do not appear to compensate for risk or persist as a result of trading frictions. Bond momentum is not just a manifestation of equity momentum.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/7/1649/1608115","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical financial analysis of corporate bond momentum without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice."],["2013","26","7","Francesca Carrieri\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Francesca Carrieri\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        McGill University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Ines Chaieb\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Ines Chaieb\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Geneva & Swiss Finance Institute\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Vihang Errunza\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Vihang Errunza\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        McGill University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","Do Implicit Barriers Matter for Globalization?","Market liberalization may not result in full market integration if implicit barriers are important.

We present new semiparametric evidence to confirm this U-shaped relationship between the risk-neutral and physical probability densities. The new pricing kernel substantially improves our ability to reconcile the time-series properties of stock returns with the cross-section of option prices. It provides a unified explanation for the implied volatility puzzle, the overreaction of long-term options to changes in short-term variance, and the fat tails of the risk-neutral return distribution relative to the physical distribution.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/8/1963/1589459","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2013","26","8","Cl\u00e1udia Cust\u00f3dio\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Cl\u00e1udia Cust\u00f3dio\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Department of Finance, Arizona State University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Daniel Metzger\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Daniel Metzger\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Department of Finance, Stockholm School of Economics\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","How Do CEOs Matter? The Effect of Industry Expertise on Acquisition Returns","This paper shows how chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics affect the performance of acquirers in diversifying takeovers. When the acquirer's CEO has previous experience in the target industry, the acquirer's abnormal announcement returns are between 1.2 and 2.0 percentage points larger than those generated by a CEO who is new to the target industry. This outcome is driven by the industry-expert CEO's ability to capture a larger fraction of the merger surplus. Industry-expert CEOs typically negotiate better deals and pay a lower premium for the target. This effect is stronger when information asymmetry is high and in bilateral negotiations compared to auctions. We also find that industry-expert CEOs on average select lower surplus deals. This evidence is consistent with industry-expert CEOs having superior negotiation skills.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/8/2008/1589222","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CEO characteristics and their impact on acquisition returns, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

We introduce a discrete-time no-arbitrage model with observable covariates, which allows for a closed-form solution for the value of credit default swaps (CDS). The default intensity is a quadratic function of the covariates, specified such that it is always positive. The model yields economically plausible results in terms of fit, the economic impact of the covariates, and the prices of risk. Risk premiums are large and account for a smaller percentage of spreads for firms with lower credit quality. Macroeconomic and firm-specific information can explain most of the variation in CDS spreads over time and across firms, even with a parsimonious specification. These findings resolve the existing disconnect in the literature regarding the value of observable covariates for credit risk pricing and default prediction.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/26/8/2049/1588926","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model for credit default swaps without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that cost retrenchment may have detrimental effects on firms with a relatively high Schumpeterian rent focus. On the other hand, asset retrenchment may erode the basis for future rent creation for firms with a higher Ricardian rent focus.

I argue that the locus of supplier capability deployment, i.e. whether supplier capabilities are deployed at the client (in-sourcing) or supplier (outsourcing), has implications for client firm performance. The findings show that in-sourcing leads to complementary effects between supplier IT capabilities and client operational capabilities. In contrast, clients with weaker operational capabilities benefit from outsourcing the respective activity to the supplier, and may even be able to reduce their capability disadvantage through outsourcing.

Despite extensive interest in corporate diversification in the strategy literature, the relationship between diversification and corporate social performance (CSP) remains largely unexplored. In this study, I propose that the level of diversification will be positively related to the CSP of firms.

By examining how organizational characteristics moderate establishments' responses to a prominent environmental information disclosure program, we provide among the first empirical evidence characterizing heterogeneous responses by those mandated to disclose information. We find particularly rapid improvement among establishments located close to their headquarters and among establishments with proximate siblings, especially when the proximate siblings are in the same industry. Large establishments improve more slowly than small establishments in sparse regions, but both groups perform similarly in dense regions, suggesting that density mitigates the power of large establishments to resist institutional pressures. Finally, establishments owned by private firms outperform those owned by public firms. We highlight implications for institutional theory, managers, and policymakers.

Despite such benefit, firms vary in their use of collaborative invention when drawing on their individual inventors' knowledge. In addressing this puzzle, we argue that competition from rival products building on similar knowledge compels firms to favor search depth over exploratory search and respond expeditiously, thus reducing a firm's inclination toward collaborative invention. In contrast with prior research's focus on how upstream resources influence a firm's position in downstream markets, this study shows that downstream competition drives heterogeneity across firms in their utilization of upstream resources.

We create analytical foundations for making empirical predictions about when plural sourcing is likely to be optimal and why the optimal mix of internal and external sourcing may vary across situations.

Using data on U.S. investor-owned electric utilities from 1992 to 2008, this paper finds that deregulation is associated with lower entry into the renewable generation market by incumbents compared to regulation. More capable firms using brown technologies, for example, coal-based generation, are less likely to enter the renewable generation market. Also, incumbents are responsive to actual, not latent, demand for renewable energy.

We challenge the unconditional logic of a winner-take-all (WTA) approach by empirically analyzing the dominant strategies used to build and position platform systems in the U.S. video game industry. We show that when platform firms pursue two popular WTA strategies concurrently and with equal intensity (growing the number and variety of applications while also securing a larger fraction of those applications with exclusivity agreements), it diminishes the benefits of each strategy to the point that it lowers platform performance. We also show that a differentiation strategy based on distinctive positioning improves a platform's performance only when a platform system is highly distinctive relative to its rivals. Our results suggest that platform competition is shaped by important strategic trade-offs and that the WTA approach will not be universally successful.

Using data from hospitals conducting specialist surgery, I find hospital performance improves independently through better surgical resource quality and from more use of a streamlined form of resource management in which overall patient team leadership and operating team leadership are held by the same physician. Generally the interaction of these two firm activities had no impact on performance. These results contribute to the strategy field's understanding of whether and when internal fit affects performance, clarifying an incorrect inference commonly made about resource-based theory.

The relationship between pay dispersion in R&D groups and firm innovation performance","Innovation is a critical organizational outcome for its potential to generate competitive advantage. While the contribution of knowledge workers to the generation of innovation is widely recognized, little is known about how organizational incentive mechanisms stimulate or inhibit these workers' behaviors that promote innovation. This study examines the relationship between pay dispersion in R&D groups and firm innovation using employee-level compensation data in US high-technology firms. The results show that (1) pay dispersion in R&D groups is negatively related to firm innovation and (2) this negative relationship is alleviated in firms with greater financial slack. This study contributes to the innovation literature by illuminating the implications of organizational incentive systems for successful innovation.

Organization structure influences knowledge flows and costs of knowledge creation and exchange inside the firm. Yet the question of how a firm's internal structure affects its governance choice for new activities has received scant empirical attention. We examine the role of internal structure, specifically unit autonomy and lateral coordination, in a firm's governance decision for new, knowledge-intensive activities. The findings show that internal structure is a \u2018shift parameter\u2019 that affects governance choice by moderating the relationship between task complexity and degree of integration.

On the one hand, preferential treatment resulting from government officials in exchange for bribes may promote exports by enhancing efficiency and enabling bribing firms to better compete in foreign markets. On the other hand, preferential treatment resulting from bribes may decrease exports by providing firms with more established positions within the domestic market diminishing the incentive to explore foreign markets. Adopting the three-stage least squares method, we test these competing arguments using a sample of firms operating within transition economies. We find that bribery within the home country decreases rather than increases firm exports. The implications of our findings are discussed.

Intraorganizational networks, knowledge, and firms' ability to innovate through technological recombination","A firm's innovativeness is driven by its ability to recombine existing technologies. Elaborating on this argument, we contend that there exist two distinct types of recombinant capabilities. First, firms may innovate through recombinant creation, i.e., by creating technological combinations new to the firm. Second, they may innovate through recombinant reuse; i.e., by reconfiguring combinations already known to the firm. We study what drives each type of capability by examining two factors: the degree of integration of a firm's intraorganizational network and the diversity of its knowledge base. We test our theoretical predictions using data on 126 semiconductor firms between 1984 and 2003. Our analyses indicate that factors that favor recombinant creation generally hinder recombinant reuse and vice versa; however, combining an integrated collaboration network and a diverse knowledge base may concurrently enhance both recombinant capabilities.

In this study, we empirically examine the entry timing implications of firms' intrinsic speed capabilities, which refer to the ability to execute investment projects faster than competitors. We hypothesize that firms with intrinsic speed capabilities face low preemption risks and, thus, can afford to wait longer for uncertainty resolution before deciding to enter new markets. This hypothesis is more applicable when investment is associated with higher levels of commitment and, thus, greater option value of waiting. A direct implication is that late entrants with intrinsic speed capabilities should have greater expected post-entry performance. We find support for these hypotheses in the Atlantic Basin liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry from 1996 to 2007.

Drawing from the house money effect perspective, we extend this literature by examining how positive deviation from prior outside director option grants values influences firm strategic risk. Additionally we draw from the behavioral agency model and the power literature to develop a multiagent contingency framework suggesting the effect of positive director pay deviation depends on the incentives and power of CEOs reflected in CEO stock ownership and CEO duality, respectively. Our empirical results indicate positive pay deviation has a positive effect on firm risk taking while high ownership and duality independently and jointly weaken this base relationship.

We underscore the criticality of the two key CEO-level functions: configuration and orchestration of senior executive team dynamic capabilities. We develop theory on how these functions create and sculpt the management team's absorptive capacity, which in turn shapes the team's adaptive capacity. We present theory about the distributed nature of efforts for organizational renewal where CEO's dynamic managerial capabilities in concerto with senior executive managerial capabilities will drive top management's ability to revitalize the firm's dominant logic and to achieve evolutionary fit.

We establish the microfoundations of strategic problem formulation by developing a theory that predicts a core set of impediments to formulation that arise when complex, ill-structured problems are addressed by heterogeneous teams. These impediments fundamentally constrain and narrow problem formulation, thereby limiting solution search and potential value creation. We establish these impediments as a set of design goals, which, if remedied by an appropriately constructed mechanism, can expand problem formulation to be more comprehensive. Finally, we consider how organizations can improve problem formulation by creating a structured process that satisfies the theoretically derived design goals and detail a specific example of this mechanism (collaborative structured inquiry).

We find that firms' political investments are negatively associated with market performance and cumulative political investments worsen both market and accounting performance. Firms placing former public officials on their boards experienced inferior market performance and similar accounting performance than firms without such board members. We find, however, that CPA is positively associated with market performance for firms in regulated industries.

We suggest that as a baseline outside successors enhance firm profitability because of the large-scale and rapid changes in emerging markets. However, this outsider premium is reduced in firms embedded in family and business group relationships, where family and inside successors can better access network resources. But the outsider premium is amplified in firms embedded in a mature market-based logic, such as high tech or foreign invested firms, because the perceived legitimacy of outsiders facilitates resource acquisition.

We propose to quantify the similarity of different industries' human capital or skill requirements, that is, the industries' skill relatedness, by using information on cross-industry labor flows. Labor flows among industries can be used to identify skill relatedness, because individuals changing jobs will likely remain in industries that value the skills associated with their previous work. Estimates show that firms are far more likely to diversify into industries that have ties to the firms' core activities in terms of our skill-relatedness measure than into industries without such ties or into industries that are linked by value chain linkages or by classification-based relatedness.

I draw from information economics to argue that incumbents will use price to respond ex ante to entry in situations characterized by asymmetric information. I suggest two situations in which asymmetric information can arise: when potential entrants are from outside the primary industry and when incumbent firms are members of R&D consortia. I then study pricing in the U.S. cable TV industry to show that pricing patterns of incumbent cable TV systems are consistent with limit pricing when the relationship between the incumbent and potential entrant is characterized by asymmetric information.

We use a game-theoretic model to analyze the impact of the deployment of unique resources on product market competition, and the impact of unique resources and sustainable competitive advantages on profits when the competitive implications of resource deployment are taken into account. We find that some of the core propositions of the resource-based view do not necessarily hold when the impact of resource deployment on product market competition is explicitly considered. Specifically, the accumulation and deployment of unique resources does not necessarily increase the firm's profit and the difference between its profit and competitors' profits. Furthermore, achieving a sustainable competitive advantage does not necessarily lead to higher profits.

We address this question by examining an important, demand-side barrier to licensing\u2014the buyers' cost of integrating a licensed technology. We argue that this cost can be affected by suppliers' knowledge transfer capabilities, buyers' absorptive capacity, and the cospecialization between R&D and downstream activities in the buyers' industries. Following this argument and a stylized bargaining model, we hypothesize that the supplier's knowledge transfer capability stimulates licensing.

Our analysis focuses on sponsor-based business model innovations where a firm monetizes its product through sponsors rather than setting prices to its customer base. We analyze strategic interactions between an innovative entrant and an incumbent where the incumbent may imitate the entrant's business model innovation once it is revealed. The results suggest that an entrant needs to strategically choose whether to reveal its innovation by competing through the new business model, or conceal it by adopting a traditional business model. We also show that the value of business model innovation may be so substantial that an incumbent may prefer to compete in a duopoly rather than to remain a monopolist.

Research has yet to acknowledge the possibility of limits to the financial returns of this important strategic construct. This study suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship between ACAP and financial performance. Based on data from 285 technology-based small and medium enterprises, we observe gains within three prospective, secondary measures of growth to diminish beyond lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful beyond intermediate levels. We find that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) moderates the ACAP-performance relationship, enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP. Further, with higher EO, higher ACAP can be achieved before financial returns diminish.Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2026","research notes and commentaries","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on absorptive capacity and financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Managers more distant from the locus of the shock and managers with stronger ex ante perceptions regarding organizational capabilities to address the shock paid more attention to opportunity aspects and less attention to threat aspects.

We believe that as the top management team (TMT) is responsible for coordinating product expansion, looking there can yield valuable clues. We argue that diversification entails significant additional information processing and that this strains top managerial resources. We hypothesize that task-related faultlines within the TMT may help it cope with product expansion while bio-demographic faultlines may hinder it. We find support for these hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of 2,730 expansion steps made by 61 German firms between 1985 and 2007: task related faultline strength increases performance when diversifying, while bio-demographic faultline strength decreases it.

Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence.

We test for inherited agglomeration effects in the hedge fund industry and find that hedge fund managers who previously worked in New York and London outperform their peers by about one percent per year. The results are driven by managers who worked in investment management positions previously, and are at least as large as traditional agglomeration effects that arise from being located in an industry hub contemporaneously. The evidence suggests that inherited agglomeration effects are an important, but as yet overlooked, factor influencing the performance of new firms.

We argue that the type of diversification strategy leads to greater innovation output when the appropriate technological search strategy is employed. Using a longitudinal study of the patenting activity of 258 manufacturing firms, we find that strategic fit is important for innovation output. More specifically, a related diversification strategy leads to greater innovation when firms use a narrow technological search strategy. In contrast, an unrelated diversification strategy leads to greater innovation when a broader technological search strategy is used. Implications for future research are discussed.

An integrated institutional and semiglobalization perspective on the internationalization of MNEs","Traditional research suggests a relationship between country-level institutions and the location choices of MNEs. However, more recent theory suggests MNEs also focus on regions (semiglobalization). Therefore, this study examines institutional effects in the context of semiglobalization by considering the influences of three formal institutions (i.e., regulatory control, political democracy, capital investments) of countries and geographic regions on MNEs' location choices of internationalization. We use a sample of Japanese MNEs operating in 45 countries within eight regions. The results show that their degree of internationalization into a country is influenced by both country and regional institutional environments. Additionally, a semiglobalization perspective provides better explanatory power than does the country-level perspective. These results present a new perspective on how MNEs consider institutional environments in their international strategy.

We conjecture that increases in product diversity initially undermine performance because of negative transfer effects but then improve it due to economies of scope. We further theorize that this U-shaped effect of product diversity becomes more pronounced as the firm increases the intensity of its technology investment, yet is likely to be attenuated by the firm's accumulated experience with intra-industry diversification. Data on 156 U.S.-based software firms operating from 1990 to 2001 furnish support for these conjectures.

The results show that measures of strategic actions\u2014new product introductions, strategic alliances, and acquisitions\u2014were positively associated with turnarounds. Conversely, measures of retrenchment actions\u2014layoffs, asset reductions, and product withdrawals\u2014were negatively associated with performance recovery.

Contractor property rights are also predicted to increase as environmental uncertainty increases and as more applications of the technology fall outside the client's intended fields of use. Contract-level data from 147 RD&E agreements in technology-intensive settings provide support for these predictions.

Various organizational economic approaches (transaction costs, property rights, real options, and resource-based) have distinctive focal problems and emphasize different combinations of market frictions. A wider recognition of the role of market frictions is useful for three main objectives. First, it helps identify an evolving market-frictions paradigm in strategic management. Second, it shows how two primary questions in strategy of why firms exist and why some firms outperform others and the three primary strategic goals of cost minimization, value creation, and value capture can be better joined and evaluated. Third, different combinations of market frictions can generate new research questions and advance theory development in the strategic management field.

In this paper, we shed light on this question by linking the embeddedness view of the multinational corporation to the literature on parenting advantage. We test our hypotheses on an original dataset of 124 manufacturing subsidiaries located in Europe. Our results indicate that the external embeddedness of the MNC is an antecedent to headquarters' value creation. We find that headquarters' investments into their own relationships with the subsidiaries' contexts are positively related to the value added by headquarters. Furthermore, this relationship is stronger when the subsidiary itself is strongly embedded. We discuss implications for the MNC literature, embeddedness research, and the literature on parenting and headquarters' roles.

We argue that executives can address such exchange hazards not only through their governance decisions, as prior research indicates, but also through their selection of exchange partners. Our experimental design complements prior research on firms' governance choices in three ways: (1) by incorporating multiple potential exchange partners rather than taking a single partner as given for a realized transaction; (2) by accommodating multiple potential entry modes to address interdependencies across governance structures; and (3) by providing direct evidence on executives' assessments of IJVs and acquisitions. We join together organizational governance research and decision-making research on IJV partner selection, two literatures that have largely developed separately.

We develop a simple two-period principal-agent model with moral hazard and adverse selection and test theoretical predictions using CEO compensation data from 1993\u20132006. Consistent with the predictions, we find that salary (bonus) is positively (negatively) associated with past performance for both continuing and newly hired CEOs. We also find that while current salary is positively associated with future performance, current bonus is not. As the model suggests, salary is adjusted to meet the reservation utility and information rent, and is positively correlated over time to reflect ability. Bonus serves to address moral hazard and adverse selection by separating high-ability agents into riskier contracts. Our results indicate that it is important to disaggregate cash compensation into salary and bonus components to understand the dynamic interaction between incentives and performance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/1/1/3428/The-Relation-between-CEO-Compensation-and-Past","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of CEO compensation and performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Yet, many firms have been reluctant to do so, which has made these firms more prone to financial reporting problems. We examine appointments of AFEs to the audit committees of S&P 1500 firms during the period 1999\u20132008 to explore whether concerns about the status of these experts discouraged firms from appointing them. We find that typical AFEs (CFOs and retired audit partners) have lower director status (board seats, trusteeships, social club memberships, and elite education) than other types of directors, and that this status gap is greater for higher status firms (larger, better connected, and more admired firms). Moreover, we find that higher status firms are less likely to appoint AFEs, suggesting that status-related concerns reduce the demand for accounting financial expertise on audit committees.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/1/107/3509/The-Role-of-Firm-Status-in-Appointments-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['status', 'expertise', 'audit committees']","The article discusses the status of accounting financial experts and their appointments, which touches on issues of equity in representation but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Further, firms with previous financial restatements had the largest economic gains, suggesting that a clawback policy can be effective at curtailing incentives for earnings manipulation. Analysis of the bid-ask spread provides evidence that these provisions contribute to reducing financial reporting risk for restating firms, while non-restating firms experience no change in the spread.

Using a simultaneous equations approach, we find a significant positive association between auditors' ex ante litigation risk and going concern reporting. By applying simultaneous equations, we also find a significant negative association between going concern reporting and auditor litigation, suggesting that auditors deter lawsuits by issuing going concern reports to their financially stressed clients. Our research further provides a more rigorous analysis of the relation between going concern reporting and lawsuit outcomes in the form of auditor litigation dismissals, small settlement amounts, and large settlement amounts.

However, the presence of a former audit firm partner (FAP) affiliated with the current auditor on the audit committee could undermine the audit committee's due diligence over the NAS pre-approval process. To alleviate such concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a three-year \u201ccooling-off\u201d period for appointing audit firm alumni as independent directors. Our analyses show that the presence of both affiliated and unaffiliated FAPs on audit committees does not lead to greater NAS procured from the auditor; rather, FAPs reduce NAS procured from the auditor.

An Experimental Study","Policy makers and corporations have recently emphasized a code of ethics as an effective aspect of corporate governance. The corporate governance literature in accounting, however, provides little empirical or theoretical support for this emphasis. We address this gap between public policy and the literature by studying the effectiveness of a code of ethics in an experimental setting. Using Bicchieri's (2006) model of social norm activation, we predict that a code of ethics will improve manager return behavior and investor confidence to the extent that it activates social norms that control opportunistic behavior. Further, we predict that adding a certification choice whereby the manager can publicly certify that he will adhere to the code will enhance the potential for the code of ethics to activate such norms. We find that a code of ethics only improves manager return behavior and investor confidence when the code incorporates a public certification choice by the manager. When the code is present but there is no certification choice, manager return behavior does not improve and investor confidence erodes over time because of increased expectations that are not met by managers. An analysis of individual return decisions and exit questionnaire responses supports the activation of social norms as the underlying mechanism behind our results.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/1/51/3406/Can-a-Code-of-Ethics-Improve-Manager-Behavior-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","5","['ethics', 'corporate governance', 'social norms']","The article discusses the role of a code of ethics in corporate governance, linking ethical behavior to social norms, which reflects moderate woke themes of ethics and accountability in business practices.

The displaced managers are further punished by the managerial labor market, as they are much less likely than control firm managers to be rehired at comparable positions.

Prior studies document significant negative market reactions to the issuance of going-concern opinions, indicating that such opinions convey bad news to investors. Insider sales followed by negative news are likely to attract regulators' scrutiny and investor class-action lawsuits. Therefore, we predict that, to reduce the risk of litigation, managers have incentives to avoid receiving going-concern opinions after their insider sales by pressuring auditors for clean audit opinions. We evaluate this prediction empirically and find that the probability of receiving a going-concern opinion is negatively associated with the level of insider selling. Further analysis indicates that this negative relation is more pronounced for firms that are economically significant to their auditors but less pronounced when (1) auditors have concerns about litigation exposure and reputation loss and (2) audit committees are more independent.

This study helps to fill this void in the literature by examining the economic consequences of the mandated disclosures of pension asset composition required under SFAS 132R. Under pension accounting rules, the composition of pension assets is a key determinant of the assumed expected rate of return (ERR) on pension assets. I find that when firms disclose asset composition for the first time under SFAS 132R, firms that were previously using upward-biased ERRs respond by increasing asset allocation to high-risk securities and/or reducing the ERR assumption.

IFRS Adoption and Audit Fees","This study provides evidence of a directly observable and significant cost of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption, by examining the fees incurred by firms for the statutory audit of their financial statements at the time of transition. Using a comprehensive dataset of all publicly traded Australian companies, we quantify an economy-wide increase in the mean level of audit costs of 23 percent in the year of IFRS transition. We estimate an abnormal IFRS-related increase in audit costs in excess of 8 percent, beyond the normal yearly fee increases in the pre-IFRS period. Further analysis provides evidence that small firms incur disproportionately higher IFRS-related audit fees. We then survey auditors to construct a firm-specific measure of IFRS audit complexity. Empirical findings suggest that firms with greater exposure to audit complexity exhibit greater increases in compliance costs for the transition to IFRS. Given the renewed debate about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should mandate IFRS for U.S. firms, our results are of timely importance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/2/429/3498/How-Much-Does-IFRS-Cost-IFRS-Adoption-and-Audit","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of IFRS adoption and audit fees, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We run an experiment with 117 participants who allocate investment dollars between two funds of differing risk. Drawing on mental accounting and hedonic editing (Thaler 1985; Thaler and Johnson 1990), we posit that a tax decrease (a \u201cgain\u201d) implemented gradually over several years will result in a greater increase in risky investment once the decrease is fully implemented than when the tax change is implemented all at once. In contrast, once a tax increase (a \u201closs\u201d) is fully implemented, a smaller decrease in risky investment will result when the change occurs all at once rather than gradually. Our findings support these expectations, suggesting that the manner of implementing a tax law change may impact decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/2/499/3447/The-Effect-of-the-Timing-and-Direction-of-Capital","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of tax changes and their impact on investment behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Based on behavioral theories, we predict that the social comparison process inherent in RPI induces both a motivation effect that results in increased effort as well as an effort distortion effect that results in the distortion of effort allocations across tasks away from the firm-preferred allocations. We also predict that both effects are magnified when the RPI is public compared to private. We argue that although the motivation effect will generally benefit performance, the effort distortion effect may be detrimental to performance. We design an experiment that isolates these two effects. Consistent with our predictions, we find that RPI induces both motivation and effort distortion effects and that both effects are magnified when the RPI is public rather than private. Although the motivation effect increases performance, we demonstrate that the effort distortion effect can decrease performance.

In our experiment, experienced auditors require correction of smaller errors in disaggregated numbers. Auditors also believe that greater disaggregation will increase SEC scrutiny of uncorrected financial statement errors in the disaggregated numbers. However, the effects are substantially reduced if the disaggregated numbers are presented in the notes. Furthermore, there is significant disagreement among participants on whether disaggregated numbers are relevant materiality benchmarks, and on what current auditing guidance requires. These results suggest a potential deficiency in current audit guidance, which traditionally has been aimed at promoting consensus in practice among auditors.

After the introduction of regulations that curtailed the informational advantage of analysts in the early 2000s, the investor recognition role of analysts remains important. Firms that lose all analyst coverage continue to suffer a significant deterioration in bid-ask spreads, trading volumes, and institutional presence but do not show a significant difference in subsequent performance relative to covered peers. In addition, controlling for other factors, we find that firms that lose all analyst coverage for one year are significantly more likely to delist than their covered peers.

However, standards are silent about how these amounts should be determined and methods being used in practice vary widely, lack theoretical support, and may either fail to meet the audit objective or do so at excessive cost. We develop a Bayesian group audit model that generalizes and extends the single-component audit risk model to aggregate assurance across multiple components. The model formally incorporates group auditor knowledge of group-level structure, controls, and context as well as component-level constraints imposed by statutory audit or other requirements. Application of the model yields component materiality amounts that achieve the group auditor's overall assurance objective by finding the optimal solution on an efficient materiality frontier. Numerical results suggest group-level controls and structured subgroups of components are central to efficient group audits.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/2/707/3493/Group-Audits-Group-Level-Controls-and-Component","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditing standards and methodologies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that high-quality financial reporting significantly mitigates the negative effect of dividends on investments, especially on R&D investments. Further, this mitigating role of financial reporting quality is particularly important among firms with a larger portion of firm value attributable to growth options. In addition, we show that the mitigating role of high-quality financial reporting is more pronounced among firms that have decreased dividends than among firms that have increased dividends. These results highlight the important role of financial reporting quality in mitigating the conflict between firms' investment and dividend decisions and thereby reducing the likelihood that firms forgo valuable investment projects in order to pay dividends.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/3/1007/3477/The-Role-of-Financial-Reporting-Quality-in","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['financial reporting', 'investment decisions', 'dividend policy']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of financial reporting and investment decisions without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We find that donors began to discount ratios only after 1998.

Most prior studies constrained tax price elasticities to be constant across nonprofits, primarily because the data do not provide donations by nonprofit type. Using nonprofit-level data and average marginal tax rates that vary across years and states, we estimate tax price elasticities by nonprofit type. We find an aggregate public charity elasticity of approximately \u22121.0 and a private foundation elasticity of approximately \u22122.0. These results suggest that the cost of the charitable contribution deduction is roughly proportional to its benefit for public charities, but that the deduction stimulates significant giving for private foundations. When we partition our elasticities across 24 public charity types, we find significant elasticities of \u22121.0 or larger for six types.

Using a sample of firms with pension liabilities that were disclosed under SFAS No. 87 and subsequently recognized under SFAS No. 158 from 1999 to 2007, I find that off-balance-sheet pension liabilities are more value relevant for firms with a higher level of institutional ownership or analyst following in the pre-158 period. More importantly, I find that SFAS No. 158 increases the value relevance of previously disclosed off-balance-sheet pension liabilities for firms with a low level of institutional ownership or analyst following, and that the increase in the value relevance becomes less pronounced for firms with a higher level of institutional ownership or analyst following. Overall, the results are consistent with the view that institutional ownership and analyst following affect the value relevance of disclosed information as well as the valuation difference between disclosed and recognized information. This study also highlights the importance of considering institutional ownership and analyst following in the value-relevance research.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/3/1095/3453/Does-Recognition-versus-Disclosure-Affect-Value","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pension accounting and the value relevance of financial disclosures, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We do not agree with their advice that researchers should avoid conditional conservatism estimates and inferences from research based on such estimates. Our theoretical and empirical analyses suggest the explanation is a correlated omitted variables problem that can be addressed in a straightforward fashion, including fixed-effects regression. Correlation between the expected components of earnings and returns biases estimates of how earnings incorporate the information contained in returns. Further, the correlation varies with returns, biasing asymmetric timeliness estimates. When firm-specific effects are taken into account, estimates do not exhibit the bias, are statistically and economically significant, are consistent with priors, and behave as a predictable function of book-to-market, size, and leverage.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/3/755/3530/On-Estimating-Conditional-Conservatism","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I/B/E/S states that it calculates actuals using a \u201cmajority rule,\u201d indicating that its actuals often do not represent the earnings that all individual analysts were forecasting. We introduce a method for measuring analyst inferred actuals, and we assess how often I/B/E/S actuals do not represent analyst inferred actuals. We find that I/B/E/S reported Q1 actual EPS differs from analyst inferred actual Q1 EPS by at least one penny 39 percent of the time during our sample period, 36.5 percent of the time when only one analyst follows the firm (hence, this consensus forecast is based on the \u201cmajority rule\u201d), and 50 percent of the time during the last three years of our sample period. We document two adverse consequences of this phenomenon.

We find that the spillover effect of a firm's ROA difference versus its foreign peers, but not domestic peers, on the firm's investment efficiency increases after IFRS adoption. We also find that increased disclosure by both foreign and domestic peers after IFRS adoption has a spillover effect on a firm's investment efficiency. Further, a firm's investment changes induced by its ROA difference versus foreign peers are more value-relevant after IFRS adoption, and those induced by increased disclosure by foreign peers under IFRS are value-relevant. Additional analyses reveal that our results are affected by legal enforcement strength, peer composition, and industry competition.

Earnings management contagion is stronger when the shared director has a leadership or accounting-relevant position (e.g., audit committee chair or member) on its board or the contagious firm's board. Irregularity contagion is stronger than error contagion. The board contagion effect is robust to controlling for endogenous matching of firms with directors, fixed firm/director effects, incidence of M&A, industry, and contagion via a common auditor or geographical proximity.

In this study we examine whether financial statements using fair values for financial instruments better describe banks' credit risk than less fair-value-based financial statements. Specifically, we assess the extent to which various leverage ratios, which are calculated using financial instruments measured along a fair value continuum, are associated with various measures of credit risk. Our leverage ratios include financial instruments measured at (1) fair value; (2) U.S. GAAP mixed-attribute values; and (3) Tier 1 regulatory capital values. The credit risk measures we consider are bond yield spreads and future bank failure. We find that leverage measured using the fair values of financial instruments explains significantly more variation in bond yield spreads and bank failure than the other less fair-value-based leverage ratios in both univariate and multivariate analyses. We also find that the fair value of loans and deposits appear to be the primary sources of incremental explanatory power.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/4/1143/3552/Fair-Value-Accounting-for-Financial-Instruments","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['fair value', 'credit risk', 'financial statements']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of accounting and financial metrics, with no significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We also find that the increase in illiquidity is more pronounced for firms with higher agency costs. These findings suggest that mandatory disclosure serves as a credible commitment mechanism and that losing such commitment by disclosure deregulation is costly in the absence of a loss of information. Our study suggests that while voluntary disclosure is effective in reducing information asymmetry, it cannot replace mandatory disclosure in addressing information problems.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/4/1239/3561/The-Commitment-Effect-versus-Information-Effect-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of disclosure and market illiquidity without addressing any social justice themes, ethical critiques, or diversity issues.

Results of a laboratory experiment support our predictions. Individuals assigned an easy productivity target and paid a fixed wage identify a greater number of production efficiencies than those with either challenging targets or target-based pay. However, individuals with challenging targets and/or target-based pay have higher productivity per production efficiency discovered, suggesting these control tools better motivate productive effort.

In this model, cash flow uncertainty arises from two fundamental sources relating, respectively, to economic performance and accounting measurement errors, but they combine into a single market factor for asset pricing. Accounting standards matter to real investment not only because information quality affects the required risk premiums on individual projects relative to a given market factor, but also because information quality affects the aggregate investment level and, hence, the market factor itself. I show that improving accounting standards causes both an expansion of the real economy and a shift in capital allocation across firms. While welfare increases as a result, firms in certain risk classes end up with higher costs of capital and lower values, some of which are crowded out from the economy.

Overall, our results are consistent with the media's allegation that the stock options granted to directors of many, if not all, state-controlled Red Chip firms are not genuine compensation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/5/1547/3517/Are-Stock-Option-Grants-to-Directors-of-State","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of stock option compensation and its implications for state-controlled firms without addressing any social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Building on the prior finding that the market reaction to vague forecasts is weaker than its reaction to precise forecasts, we find that for management forecasts disclosed before insider sales, more positive (negative) news forecasts are more (less) precise than other management forecasts. The opposite applies to management forecasts disclosed before insider purchases. These results are consistent with managers strategically choosing forecast precision to increase stock prices before insider sales and to decrease stock prices before insider purchases. Additional analyses indicate that the impact of managerial incentives on forecast precision is less pronounced when institutional ownership is high or when disclosure risk is high, and is more pronounced when investors have difficulty in assessing the precision of managers' information.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/5/1575/3553/Managerial-Incentives-and-Management-Forecast","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of managerial incentives and forecast precision without addressing any social justice themes, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Consistent with this prediction, we find that, following the 1997 (TRA) and the 2003 (JGTRRA) cuts in U.S. individual shareholder taxes, financially constrained firms enjoyed larger reductions in their cost of equity capital than did other firms. The results are consistent with the incidence of the tax reductions falling mostly on firms with both pressing needs for capital and disproportionate ownership by individuals, the only shareholders who benefited from the legislations. The paper provides a partial explanation for the seemingly puzzling finding that, following the unprecedented 2003 reduction in dividend tax rates, non-dividend-paying firms outperformed dividend-paying firms. The results suggest that it was not dividend status that mattered, but financial constraint, a common attribute of non-dividend-paying companies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/5/1603/3596/Does-Financial-Constraint-Affect-the-Relation","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial constraints and shareholder taxes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, to the extent that one party may renege on its contractual obligations, the other party incurring the cost of the relationship-specific investment bears additional risk and is less willing to invest such that sub-optimal investment occurs. In countries where enforceability of explicit contracts is particularly weak, parties have incentives to signal their willingness to fulfill implicit claims and maintain long-term relationships. We predict that firms engage in income smoothing to send such a signal to their suppliers. Consistent with these expectations, we find that firms that both reside in countries with weak contract enforceability and operate in industries with a greater need for relationship-specific investments tend to smooth reported income more. We further decompose income smoothing into \u201cinformational\u201d and \u201cgarbled\u201d components and find that results are driven by the informational component of income smoothing.

Tax-motivated loss shifting is reflected in both recurring and nonrecurring items and is more evident for financially constrained firms. Analysts do not generally incorporate tax-motivated loss shifting into their earnings forecasts, resulting in more negative analyst forecast errors for firms with tax-based incentives than for firms without.

Despite their use, the behavioral and performance effects of tangible rewards have received minimal research attention. Relative to cash rewards, we predict tangible rewards will have positive effects on goal commitment and performance but will lead employees to set easier goals, which will negatively affect performance. The overall performance impact of tangible rewards will depend on the relative strength of these competing effects. We conduct a quasi-experiment at five call centers of a financial services company. Employees at two locations earned cash rewards for goal attainment while employees at three locations earned points, with equivalent retail value to cash rewards, redeemable for merchandise. Results show that cash rewards lead to better performance through their effects on the difficulty of the goals employees selected. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/5/1805/3572/The-Effects-of-Reward-Type-on-Employee-Goal","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['reward', 'performance', 'goal commitment']","The article primarily focuses on the effects of reward types on performance and goal setting, lacking significant engagement with social justice or ethical themes.

For stock lenders, dividend taxation is associated with a decrease in the supply of shortable shares and an increase in equity lending fees around the dividend record date. For short sellers, potential reimbursement costs are associated with a significant decrease in short volume before the ex-dividend date followed by a significant increase after the ex-date. Prior research shows that short selling improves price efficiency and formation. Hence, because of the negative effects of taxation on shorting, market quality declines along several dimensions: equity mispricing, increased loan search frictions, loan price inefficiencies, and market microstructure breakdown. In sum, this study documents that taxation constricts the shorting market around the dividend dates, which in turn has negative implications for market quality.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/5/1833/3563/The-Effects-of-Dividend-Taxation-on-Short-Selling","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of taxation and market quality without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The probability that the comment letter results in a restatement is higher for smaller companies and for companies engaging a small audit firm. We also provide evidence that comments relating to accounting issues result in higher remediation costs, largely due to the additional time required to resolve comments relating to classification issues and fair value issues.

Using a within-CEO empirical design, we find that retiring CEOs are more likely to issue forecasts of future earnings, and that they issue such forecasts more frequently in their terminal year relative to other years during their tenure with the firm. Further, retiring CEOs' terminal-year forecasts of future earnings are more likely to convey good news and are more optimistically biased relative to pre-terminal years. Opportunistic terminal-year forecasting behavior is: (1) more pronounced in the presence of higher CEO equity incentives and when discretionary expenditures are cut in the terminal year, and (2) less pronounced in the presence of stronger monitoring mechanisms, such as higher institutional ownership.

We first examine why some firms listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSX Venture) voluntarily adopted the more stringent governance policy in 2004 that requires all audit committee members to be independent and financially literate. We develop a parsimonious analytical model that shows that both compliance costs and financing needs have an impact on firms' adoption decisions. Confirming the model's predictions, we find that TSX Venture firms with low compliance costs and greater future financing needs are more likely to adopt the new policy voluntarily. The analytical model also shows that high-quality audit committees enhance firm values by reducing the likelihood of managerial resource diversion. Consistent with the predictions of our analytical model, we find that the adoption decision has a positive impact on firm value and a negative impact on firms' cost of equity capital for both Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX Venture firms. As corroborating evidence of the economic impact of the more stringent governance policy, we also show that both TSX and TSX Venture firms have improved investment efficiency following the adoption decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/1939/3511/Voluntary-Adoption-of-More-Stringent-Governance","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['governance', 'independent', 'financially literate']","The article primarily focuses on corporate governance and financial metrics, with limited reference to social themes.

We develop a model of taxpayer and tax authority behavior inside and outside of an enhanced relationship program. Our model suggests that, despite the adversarial nature of the relationship, an enhanced relationship program is mutually beneficial in many settings. The benefits are due to lower combined government audit and taxpayer compliance costs. These costs are lower because taxpayers are less likely to claim positions with weak support and the government is less likely to challenge positions with strong support inside the program. Further, we show that an increase in the ability of the tax authority to identify uncertain tax positions makes an enhanced relationship tax-compliance program more attractive to both the taxpayer and the tax authority.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/1971/3507/When-are-Enhanced-Relationship-Tax-Compliance","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['compliance', 'mutually beneficial', 'tax authority']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of tax compliance and the relationship between taxpayers and tax authorities, with no significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

The Joint Influence of Advisor Social Bond and Advice Justifiability","Auditors frequently seek informal advice from peers to improve judgment quality, but the conditions under which advice improves auditor judgment are poorly understood. We predict and find evidence of a trust heuristic among auditors receiving advice from advisors with whom they share a social bond. This heuristic is evident among non-specialists, who weight advice according to its justifiability when it is received from a weaker social bond advisor, but fail to objectively assess the quality of advice received and weight it heavily when it comes from a stronger social bond advisor, regardless of its justifiability. Specialists, while less prone to the trust heuristic in advice weighting, show inconsistencies in advice weighting and their assessments of advice quality.

This defensiveness likely arises from an aversive social comparison process attributable to the high ego-relevance of a task within one's specialization.

Evidence from Discretionary Accruals Prior to Investment","Despite a large literature on discretionary accruals, how the use of discretionary accruals impacts corporate financial decisions is not well understood. We hypothesize that a financially constrained firm with valuable projects can use discretionary accruals to credibly signal positive prospects, enabling it to raise capital to make the investments. We examine a large panel of firms during 1987 to 2009 and find that financially constrained firms with good investment opportunities have significantly higher discretionary accruals prior to investment compared to their unconstrained counterparts. Constrained high-accrual firms have higher earnings-announcement returns than constrained low-accrual firms, obtain more equity and debt financing, and invest in projects that appear to improve performance. These results provide supporting evidence that the use of discretionary accruals can help constrained firms with valuable projects ease those constraints and increase firm value.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/2117/3478/Can-Managers-Use-Discretionary-Accruals-to-Ease","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of discretionary accruals and their impact on corporate financial decisions without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2013","88","6","Paul E.

The purpose of this study is to rigorously examine how the integration of auditors has evolved since the civil rights and quiet revolution period. The primary distinctive feature of this study is that it evaluates the auditing profession's integration by comparing it to samples of occupations similar to auditing for the purpose of isolating auditing-specific forces influencing integration. I find that the pay structure in auditing is unusually equal, consistent with \u201cequal pay for equal work.\u201d The results for women, Hispanics, and miscellaneous minorities are consistent with members of these groups responding as one might expect to equal pay in auditing: groups that are poorly paid in other occupations select into auditing at higher rates, and groups that are well paid in other occupations select out of auditing at higher rates. The results for blacks are anomalous in that their pay in auditing has been good relative to many comparable occupations, but they have nevertheless been poorly represented in auditing. There are a number of theories that could potentially explain why blacks may be anomalously underrepresented in auditing. To begin to test them, I perform an exploratory analysis of the representation of women and minorities among college freshmen, college graduates, and young auditors. The results suggest that accounting is a popular degree among black college freshmen and that a relatively high percentage of accounting graduates are black. However, although they are well represented in the pool of potential new auditors, black accounting graduates enter the auditing profession at very low rates relative to other occupations requiring levels of education similar to auditing. The results suggest that black underrepresentation in auditing is not due to a lack of awareness among, or role models for, young blacks.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/2145/3499/The-Integration-of-Women-and-Minorities-into-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","8","['integration', 'women', 'minorities', 'equal pay', 'representation']","The article focuses on the integration of women and minorities in the auditing profession, highlighting themes of equal pay and representation, which are central to social justice and equity discussions.

Specifically, CEO pay is negatively (positively) associated with peer-group performance when firms compete as strategic substitutes (complements). This finding suggests that firms provide CEO incentives in order to influence strategic interaction with peer firms. Further, the directionally opposite pay-for-peer-group-performance sensitivities, i.e., negative (positive) for substitutes (complements), cancel each other in aggregate, which may explain the lack of consistent support found in prior research for the role of RPE in filtering out common noise from the CEO's performance. I also document that the weight on both substitute and complement peer performance increases, in absolute value, with the intensity of industry competition relative to the weight on own-firm performance. Finally, taking firms' explicit RPE disclosures into account does not affect the results.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/2179/3560/Are-Relative-Performance-Measures-in-CEO-Incentive","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of CEO incentive contracts and strategic competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The premium (discount) investors apply to these glamour (value) stocks also correlates significantly with the difference in return skewness. These findings suggest that the value/glamour-stock puzzle is partially explained by investor preference for positive skewness in stock returns. Such preference for skewness, which is consistent with investors having inverse S-shaped utility functions, is observed in such consumer behaviors as lottery purchases and gambling. This paper further documents significant predictive power of accounting-based measures, such as the book rate of return, with respect to the skewness of stock returns.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/88/6/2213/3597/Book-to-Market-Ratio-and-Skewness-of-Stock-Returns","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock returns and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.
