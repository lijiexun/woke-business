The author believes academic papers are like rock and roll bands: whether an audience finds them interesting is a matter of perspective, if not taste. Subject matter is important and he finds that several kinds pique his interest in paper. The author believes that papers in graduate classes are too often celebrated for their methods but some papers are interesting because their methods are so different from the ubiquitous secondary data sets, attitude surveys, and interviews of top managers that provide most of the grist in the field. He finds methods that get close enough to behavior to show how people wittingly or unwittingly build and maintain their social worlds of particular interest.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2006.20785495","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['social worlds', 'perspective', 'methods']","The article discusses the nature of academic papers and what makes them interesting, but it lacks a strong focus on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

We argue that trust matters more to performance under behavioral uncertainty and less under environmental uncertainty. In data from 126 international alliances, the positive relationship between trust and performance is stronger under high behavioral uncertainty and weaker under high environmental uncertainty. We conclude that partners should concentrate on developing interorganizational trust where potential improvement in alliance performance justifies this effort, which in turn depends on the type of uncertainty faced.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2006.22798171","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['trust', 'performance', 'alliances']","The article discusses trust in the context of alliance performance but does not engage with social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Findings show that top managers who engage in ingratiatory behavior toward their CEO, with ingratiation comprising flattery, opinion conformity, and favor-rendering, will be more likely to receive board appointments at other firms where their CEO serves as director and at boards to which the CEO is indirectly connected in the board interlock network. Further results suggest that interpersonal influence behavior substitutes to some degree for the advantages of an elite background or demographic majority status. Our findings help explain why norms of director deference to CEOs have persisted despite increased diversity in the corporate elite and have implications for research on corporate governance, social networks in the corporate elite, and for the sociological question of whether demographic minorities and individuals who lack privileged backgrounds have equal access to positions of leadership in large U.S. companies.

We hypothesize that symbiotic and commensalistic interpopulation relations function as channels of information about entrepreneurial opportunities and that differing access to such information influences the founding rate. Empirical analyses of U.S. instruments manufacturers support this argument. The founding rate of instruments manufacturers rises with the densities of organizational populations that have symbiotic and commensalistic relationships with instruments manufacturers. These factors encourage the initial foundings of instruments manufacturers in areas where such organizations were not previously found. The dominance of organizational populations tied to instruments manufacturing by symbiotic or commensalistic relations increases the rate of foundings of instruments manufacturers, whereas the dominance of organizational populations that lack these relations decreases it. Finally, we find that interpopulation relationships that hinge on direct contact have less impact on initial foundings as geographic distance increases.

Using data at both the professional critic and consumer levels, I demonstrate the empirical validity of this principle: films targeting more genres attract larger audiences but are less appealing to those audience members. Moreover, I find that audiences' perceptions of a film's fit with targeted genres drive this trade-off, as multi-genre films are difficult for audiences to make sense of, leading to poor fit with tastes and lowered appeal.

In contrast to prior studies, which have appeared to find performance benefits to both buyers and sellers when exchange occurs embedded within existing social relations, we propose that the apparent mutual advantages of embedded exchange can also emerge from endogenous behavior that benefits one party at the expense of the other: actors offer better terms of trade and allocate more resources to transactions embedded within existing social relations, thereby contributing to the ostensible advantages of such exchange patterns. Findings show that not only do distributors exhibit a preference for carrying films involving key personnel with whom they had prior exchange relations, but also they tend to favor these films when allocating scarce resources (opening dates and promotion effort). After controlling for the effects of these decisions, films with deeper prior relations to the distributor perform worse at the box office. The results suggest that, rather than benefiting from repeated exchange, distributors overallocate scarce resources to these prior exchange partners, enacting a self-confirming dynamic.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.51.4.560","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['social relations', 'exchange', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on the dynamics of exchange relationships in the film industry without addressing themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

Our qualitative investigation of the leadership of extreme action medical teams in an emergency trauma center revealed a hierarchical, deindividualized system of shared leadership. At the heart of this system is dynamic delegation: senior leaders' rapid and repeated delegation of the active leadership role to and withdrawal of the active leadership role from more junior leaders of the team. Our findings suggest that dynamic delegation enhances extreme action teams' ability to perform reliably while also building their novice team members' skills. We highlight the contingencies that guide senior leaders' delegation and withdrawal of the active leadership role, as well as the values and structures that motivate and enable the shared, ongoing practice of dynamic delegation.

In this paper, we empirically analyze the degree to which used products cannibalize new-product sales for books\u2014one of the most prominent used-product categories sold online. To do this, we use a unique data set collected from Amazon.com\u2019s new and used book marketplaces to measure the degree to which used products cannibalize new-product sales. We then use these estimates to measure the resulting first-order changes in publisher welfare and consumer surplus. Our analysis suggests that used books are poor substitutes for new books for most of Amazon\u2019s customers. The cross-price elasticity of new-book demand with respect to used-book prices is only 0.088. As a result, only 16% of used-book sales at Amazon cannibalize new-book purchases. The remaining 84% of used-book sales apparently would not have occurred at Amazon\u2019s new-book prices. Further, our estimates suggest that this increase in book readership from Amazon\u2019s used-book marketplace increases consumer surplus by approximately $67.21 million annually. This increase in consumer surplus, together with an estimated $45.05 million loss in publisher welfare and a $65.76 million increase in Amazon\u2019s profits, leads to an increase in total welfare to society of approximately $87.92 million annually from the introduction of used-book markets at Amazon.com.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0072","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['welfare', 'consumer surplus', 'used products']","The article discusses welfare impacts and consumer surplus, indicating some concern for societal outcomes, but it primarily focuses on empirical analysis and market dynamics without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques."],["2006","17","1","Dennis F.

This experimental study examined whether delay and two other website design variables (site breadth and content familiarity) have interaction effects on user performance, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The three experimental factors (delay, familiarity, and breadth) collectively impact the cognitive costs and penalties that users incur when making choices in their search for target information. An experiment was conducted with 160 undergraduate business majors in a completely counterbalanced, fully factorial design that exposed them to two websites and asked them to browse the sites for nine pieces of information. Results showed that all three factors have strong direct impacts on performance and user attitudes, in turn affecting behavioral intentions to return to the site, as might be expected. A significant three-way interaction was found between all three factors indicating that these factors not only individually impact a user\u2019s experiences with a website, but also act in combination to either increase or decrease the costs a user incurs. Two separate analyses support an assertion that attitudes mediate the relationship of the three factors on behavioral intentions. The implications of these results for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. Additional research is needed to discover other factors that mitigate or accentuate the effects of delay, other effects of delay, and under what amounts of delay these effects occur.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0073","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of website design and user performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this study, which is set in the context of conceptual modeling, we examine the effects of both IS and application domain knowledge on different types of schema understanding tasks: syntactic and semantic comprehension tasks and schema-based problem-solving tasks. Our thesis was that while IS domain knowledge is important in solving all such tasks, the role of application domain knowledge is contingent upon the type of understanding task under investigation. We use the theory of cognitive fit to establish theoretical differences in the role of application domain knowledge among the different types of schema understanding tasks. We hypothesize that application domain knowledge does not influence the solution of syntactic and semantic comprehension tasks for which cognitive fit exists, but does influence the solution of schema-based problem-solving tasks for which cognitive fit does not exist. To assess performance on different types of conceptual schema understanding tasks, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants with high- and low-IS domain knowledge responded to two equivalent conceptual schemas that represented high and low levels of application knowledge (familiar and unfamiliar application domains). As expected, we found that IS domain knowledge is important in the solution of all types of conceptual schema understanding tasks in both familiar and unfamiliar applications domains, and that the effect of application domain knowledge is contingent on task type. Our findings for the EER model were similar to those for the ER model. Given the differential effects of application domain knowledge on different types of tasks, this study highlights the importance of considering more than one application domain in designing future studies on conceptual modeling.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0081","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information systems and cognitive fit without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using data gathered from Freshmeat.net and project home pages, the main conclusions derived from the analysis are that (1) license restrictiveness and organizational sponsorship interact to influence user perceptions of the likely utility of open source software in such a way that users are most attracted to projects that are sponsored by nonmarket organizations and that employ nonrestrictive licenses, and (2) licensing and sponsorship address complementary developer motivations such that the influence of licensing on development activity depends on what kind of organizational sponsor a project has.

Previous research has sought to explain anecdotal evidence from some industries on the recent reduction in the number of suppliers selected to do business with buyers by appealing to relationship-specific costs that suppliers may incur. In contrast, this paper emphasizes that information technology enables greater completeness of buyer-supplier contracts through more economical monitoring of additional dimensions of supplier performance. The number of terms included in the contract is an imperfect substitute for the number of suppliers. Based on this idea, alternative conditions are identified under which increased use of information technology leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers without invoking relationship-specific costs. We find that a substantial increase in contract completeness due to reduced cost of information technology could increase the cost per supplier even though the cost of coordination and the cost per term monitored decrease. Such an increase in the cost per supplier leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers with whom the buyer chooses to do business. Similarly, we find that if coordination cost is reduced when more information technology is deployed so that the number of suppliers in the buyer\u2019s pool increases substantially, the buyer might choose to make the supplier contracts less complete, instead relying on a more market-oriented approach to finding a supplier with good fit.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0083","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract completeness and buyer-supplier relationships without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using an organization integration lens that takes into account investments in complementary resources as well as an options thinking logic about the value of an ERP platform, we argue that not all ERP purchases have the same potential impact at the firm level due to ERP project decisions made at the time of purchase. Based on a sample of 116 investment announcements in United States\u2013based firms between 1997 and 2001, we find support for our hypotheses that ERP projects with greater functional scope (two or more value-chain modules) or greater physical scope (multiple sites) result in positive, higher shareholder returns. Furthermore, the highest increases in returns (3.29%) are found for ERP purchases with greater functional scope and greater physical scope; negative returns are found for projects with lesser functional scope and lesser physical scope. These findings provide empirical support for prior theory about the organizational integration benefits of ERP systems, the contribution of complementary resource investments to the business value of IT investments, and the growth options associated with IT platform investments.

This analysis revealed that over this period the management discipline had on average the highest proportion of faculty publishing in premier journals (12.7 authors per 100 management faculty), followed by finance (9.4 authors per 100 faculty), marketing (9.2 authors per 100 faculty), IS (5.5 authors per 100 faculty), and accounting (4.8 authors per 100 faculty). A further analysis examined these ratios for the different disciplines over time, finding that the ratios of authors to faculty have actually decreased for the disciplines of marketing and IS over this time period but have remained stable for the disciplines of accounting, management, and finance. Given steady growth in faculty size of all disciplines, the proportion of faculty publishing articles in premier journals in 2003 for all disciplines is lower than their 10-year averages, with IS having the lowest proportion in 2003. A sensitivity analysis reveals that without substantial changes that would allow more IS faculty to publish in the premier journals (e.g., by increasing publication cycles, number of premier outlets, and so on), IS will continue to lag far below the average of other disciplines. The implications of these findings for IS researchers, for institutions and administrators of IS programs, and for the IS academic discipline are examined.

Understanding the impact of different reputation mechanism design parameters on the resulting market efficiency has thus emerged as a question of theoretical and practical interest. Along these lines, this note studies the impact of the frequency of reputation profile updates on cooperation and efficiency. The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather only updates a trader's public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader's most recent k ratings can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted. This paper derives expressions for calculating the optimal profile updating interval k, discusses the implications of this finding for existing systems, such as eBay, and proposes alternative reputation mechanism architectures that attain higher maximum efficiency than the, currently popular, reputation mechanisms that publish summaries of a trader's recent ratings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0092","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['reputation', 'trust', 'cooperation']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of reputation mechanisms in electronic markets, emphasizing efficiency and profit margins rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

The goals of this study are (1) to investigate whether or not the provision of trust-assuring arguments on the website of an Internet store increase consumer trust in that Internet store and (2) to identify the most effective form of trust-assuring arguments to provide guidelines for their implementation. Toulmin's (1958) model of argumentation is proposed as a basis to identify the elements of an argument and to strengthen the effects of trust-assuring arguments on consumer trust in an Internet store. Based on Toulmin's (1958) model of argumentation, three elements of arguments that commonly appear in daily communication; namely, claim, data, and backing, are identified. Data refers to the grounds for a claim, while backing is used for providing reasons for why the data should be accepted. By combining these three elements, three forms of trust-assuring arguments (claim only, claim plus data, and claim plus data and backing) are developed. The effects of these three forms of trust-assuring arguments on consumer trust in an Internet store are tested by comparing them to a no trust-assuring argument condition in a laboratory experiment with 112 participants. The results indicate (1) providing trust-assuring arguments that consist of claim plus data or claim plus data and backing increases consumers' trusting belief but displaying arguments that contain claim only does not and (2) trust-assuring arguments that include claim plus data and backing lead to the highest level of trusting belief among the three forms of arguments examined in this study. Based on the results, we argue that Toulmin's (1958) model of argumentation is an effective basis for website designers to develop convincing trust-assuring arguments and to improve existing trust-assuring arguments in Internet stores.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0093","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['trust', 'arguments', 'consumer trust']","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer trust and argumentation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, resulting in a low 'woke' score.

To address this question, this study focuses on the business process level of analysis and introduces the construct of IT leveraging competence\u2014the ability to effectively use IT functionalities. This construct is conceptualized in the context of new product development (NPD). IT leveraging competence is shown to indirectly influence competitive advantage in NPD through two key mediating links: functional competencies (the ability to effectively execute operational NPD processes) and dynamic capabilities (the ability to reconfigure functional competencies to address turbulent environments). Environmental turbulence is also shown to moderate the process by which IT leveraging competence influences competitive advantage in NPD. Empirical data were collected from 180 NPD managers. Through the construct of IT leveraging competence, the study shows that the effective use of IT functionalities, even generic functionalities, by business units can help build a competitive advantage. The study also shows that the strategic effect of IT leveraging competence is more pronounced in higher levels of environmental turbulence. This effect is not direct: It is fully mediated by both dynamic capabilities and functional competencies. Taken together, these findings suggest that IS researchers should look beyond the direct effects of firm-level IT infrastructures and focus their attention on how business units can leverage IT functionalities to better reconfigure and execute business processes. In turbulent environments, focusing on these aspects is even more vital.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0094","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT and competitive advantage without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or diversity themes.

A common practice for many organizations today is to remove identity-related attributes from the customer records before releasing them to data miners or analysts. We investigate the effect of this practice and demonstrate that many records in a data set could be uniquely identified even after identity-related attributes are removed. We propose a perturbation method for categorical data that can be used by organizations to prevent or limit disclosure of confidential data for identifiable records when the data are provided to analysts for classification, a common data-mining task. The proposed method attempts to preserve the statistical properties of the data based on privacy protection parameters specified by the organization.

In this article, we present a systematic approach for reconceptualizing the system usage construct in particular nomological contexts. Comprising two stages, definition and selection, the approach enables researchers to develop clear and valid measures of system usage for a given theoretical and substantive context. The definition stage requires that researchers define system usage and explicate its underlying assumptions. In the selection stage, we suggest that system usage be conceptualized in terms of its structure and function. The structure of system usage is tripartite, comprising a user, system, and task, and researchers need to justify which elements of usage are most relevant for their study. In terms of function, researchers should choose measures for each element (i.e., user, system, and/or task) that tie closely to the other constructs in the researcher's nomological network. To provide evidence of the viability of the approach, we undertook an empirical investigation of the relationship between system usage and short-run task performance in cognitively engaging tasks. The results support the benefits of the approach and show how an inappropriate choice of usage measures can lead researchers to draw opposite conclusions in an empirical study. Together, the approach and the results of the empirical investigation suggest new directions for research into the nature of system usage, its antecedents, and its consequences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0096","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical examination of system usage in information systems research without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Critical to the success of these initiatives is the transfer of knowledge across individuals who occupy a range of roles in various organizational units involved in software production. Prior research suggests that a portfolio of different mechanisms, employed frequently, can be required for effective knowledge transfer. However, little research exists that examines under what situations differing portfolios of mechanisms are selected. Further, it is not clear how effective different portfolio designs are. In this study, we conceptualize knowledge transfer portfolios in terms of their composition (the types of mechanisms used) and their intensity (the frequency with which the mechanisms are utilized). We hypothesize the influence of organizational design decisions on the composition and intensity of knowledge transfer portfolios for SPI. We then posit how the composition and intensity of knowledge transfer portfolios affect performance improvement. Our findings indicate that a more intense portfolio of knowledge transfer mechanisms is used when the source and recipient are proximate, when they are in a hierarchical relationship, or when they work in different units. Further, a source and recipient select direction-based portfolios when they are farther apart, in a hierarchical relationship, or work in different units. In terms of performance, our results reveal that the fit between the composition and intensity of the knowledge transfer portfolio influences the recipient's performance improvement. At lower levels of intensity direction-based portfolios are more effective, while at higher levels of intensity routine-based portfolios yield the highest performance improvement. We discuss the implications of our findings for researchers and for managers who want to promote knowledge transfer to improve software processes in their organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0098","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software process improvement and knowledge transfer without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The study also proposes that two important system design factors\u2014control transparency and outcome feedback\u2014will incrementally influence PIQ. An empirical test of the model demonstrated that PIQ predicts trusting beliefs and perceived risk, which mediate the effects of PIQ on intention to use the exchange. Thus, PIQ constitutes an important indirect factor influencing exchange adoption. Furthermore, control transparency had a significant influence on PIQ, while outcome feedback had no significant incremental effect over that of control transparency. The study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the important role of PIQ in I-O systems adoption and by showing that information cues available to a user during an initial exchange session can help build trusting beliefs and mitigate perceived exchange risk. For managers of I-O exchanges, the study implies that building into the system appropriate control transparency mechanisms can increase the likelihood of exchange success.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0103","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['trust', 'transparency', 'risk']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of information quality, risk, and trust in data exchanges, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Based on data collected from 71 firms, we test our research hypotheses on the impact of CPC on product design quality, design cycle time, and development cost. We find that CPC implementation is associated with greater collaboration among product design teams. This collaboration has a significant, positive impact on product quality and reduces cycle time and product development cost. Further analyses reveal that CPC implementation is associated with substantial cost savings that can be attributed to improvements in product design quality, design turnaround time, greater design reuse, and lower product design documentation and rework costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0104","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['collaboration', 'efficiency', 'design quality']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of collaboration software and its impact on product design and development, with no significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Successful business process management depends on effective workflow modeling and analysis. One of the important aspects of workflow analysis is the data-flow perspective because, given a syntactically correct process sequence, errors can still occur during workflow execution due to incorrect data-flow specifications. However, there have been only scant treatments of the data-flow perspective in the literature and no formal methodologies are available for systematically discovering data-flow errors in a workflow model. As an indication of this research gap, existing commercial workflow management systems do not provide tools for data-flow analysis at design time. In this paper, we provide a data-flow perspective for detecting data-flow anomalies such as missing data, redundant data, and potential data conflicts. Our data-flow framework includes two basic components: data-flow specification and data-flow analysis; these components add more analytical rigor to business process management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0105","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of workflow technology and data-flow analysis without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

However, the literature has solely focused on numerical (positive and negative) feedback ratings, alas ignoring the role of feedback text comments. These text comments are proposed to convey useful reputation information about a seller\u2019s prior transactions that cannot be fully captured with crude numerical ratings. Building on the economics and trust literatures, this study examines the rich content of feedback text comments and their role in building a buyer\u2019s trust in a seller\u2019s benevolence and credibility. In turn, benevolence and credibility are proposed to differentiate among sellers by influencing the price premiums that a seller receives from buyers. This paper utilizes content analysis to quantify over 10,000 publicly available feedback text comments of 420 sellers in eBay\u2019s online auction marketplace, and to match them with primary data from 420 buyers that recently transacted with these 420 sellers. These dyadic data show that evidence of extraordinary past seller behavior contained in the sellers\u2019 feedback text comments creates price premiums for reputable sellers by engendering buyer\u2019s trust in the sellers\u2019 benevolence and credibility (controlling for the impact of numerical ratings). The addition of text comments and benevolence helps explain a greater variance in price premiums (R2 = 50%) compared to the existing literature (R2 = 20%\u201330%). By showing the economic value of feedback text comments through trust in a seller\u2019s benevolence and credibility, this study helps explain the success of online marketplaces that primarily rely on the text comments (versus crude numerical ratings) to differentiate among sellers and prevent a market of lemon sellers. By integrating the economics and trust literatures, the paper has theoretical and practical implications for better understanding the nature and role of feedback mechanisms, trust building, price premiums, and seller differentiation in online marketplaces.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1060.0106","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'benevolence', 'credibility']","The article discusses the importance of trust and seller credibility in online marketplaces, which touches on ethical considerations in seller-buyer interactions.

When internal transfers are valued at the prevailing market price, the resulting transactions are distorted by double marginalization. The imposition of intracompany discounts will always improve overall firm profits provided the supplying division is capacity constrained. Under certain conditions it is then possible to design discount rules so that the resulting prices and sales quantities are efficient from the corporate perspective. In contrast, the impact of intracompany discounts remains ambiguous when the capacity of the selling division is essentially unlimited.

We distinguish two sources of uncertainty that raise reliability concerns: inherent uncertainty and incentive uncertainty. By inherent uncertainty, we refer to uncertainty about the quality of raw information regarding future cash flows. By incentive uncertainty, we refer to uncertainty about the quality of accounting numbers conveying the raw information. We explore features of accounting that can effectively deal with these two types of uncertainties in order to aid in the debt-equity decision of the firm. To handle inherent uncertainty, preferable accounting involves flexible revenue/expense recognition rules that recognize more profit when the uncertainty level is low. To deal with incentive uncertainty, a stringent revenue/expense recognition rule may be desirable to fend off management's opportunistic reporting behavior. Inflexible accounting rules cause a firm's financing choices to deviate from what would hold with complete information. Given any accounting rule, an information environment with a lower (higher) uncertainty regarding future cash inflows leads to higher (lower) expected debt financing. This is because assessed default risk is increasing in the uncertainty of future cash inflows, holding the uncertainty of the outflows constant.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00195.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and capital structure without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We show that the drift is significantly larger when defining the earnings surprise using analysts' forecasts and actual earnings from I/B/E/S than when using a time series model based on Compustat earnings data. Neither Compustat's policy of restating earnings nor the inclusion of \u201cspecial items\u201d in reported earnings contribute significantly to the disparity in drift magnitudes. Rather, our results suggest that this disparity is attributable to differences between analyst forecasts and those of time-series models\u2014or at least to factors correlated with these differences. Further, we document that analyst forecasts lead to return patterns around future earnings announcements that differ from those observed when using time-series models, suggesting that the two types of surprises may capture somewhat different forms of mispricing.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00196.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock price movements and earnings announcements without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Second, when the audit firm has limited wealth, an additional client can actually decrease the audit quality and increase the average likelihood of audit failure relative to a single-client setting because of reporting externalities.

Timely recognition requires accruals when it precedes complete realization of the gains and losses in cash. We show that nonlinear accruals models incorporating the asymmetry in gain and loss recognition (timelier loss recognition, or conditional conservatism) offer a substantial specification improvement, explaining substantially more variation in accruals than equivalent linear specifications. Conversely, conventional linear accruals models, by omitting the loss recognition asymmetry, exhibit substantial attenuation bias and offer a comparatively poor specification of the accounting accrual process. Linear specifications also understate the ability of current earnings to predict future cash flows. These findings have implications for our understanding of accrual accounting and conservatism, as well as for researchers estimating discretionary accruals, earnings management, and earnings quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00198.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accrual accounting and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

This study documents the importance of performing robustness tests when testing economic or behavioral explanations for apparent accounting-related security mispricing. We find that performing robustness tests that exclude a small number of firm-year observations (approximately 200 firm-year observations or about 1% of the entire sample) reveals an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and total accruals. An inverted U-shaped relation is inconsistent with the functional fixation (earnings fixation) hypothesis. We conduct similar robustness tests for the abnormal accrual anomaly and the net operating assets anomaly proposed by other investigators, and also find an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and abnormal accruals and net operating assets. These findings are inconsistent with the explanations put forth by those investigators. Such evidence leads us to conclude that the accrual-related anomalies are unlikely to be due to investors' inability to process accounting information, as suggested by the functional fixation hypotheses tested.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00202.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Our results also suggest that management discloses good news in cash flow to mitigate the negative impact of bad news in earnings, to lend credibility to good news in earnings, and to signal economic viability when the firm is young. Our finding that management cash flow forecasts primarily convey good news is in contrast to the generally negative nature of management earnings guidance and suggests that different incentives drive firms' disclosure of different financial information.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00206.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cash flow forecasting and management practices without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When a principal must rely on subjective information to create incentives for a group of agents, discretionary bonus pools are shown to be optimal mechanisms. Despite their optimality, however, discretionary bonus pools entail an additional agency cost relative to the benchmark of optimal contracts based on objective and verifiable information. Our analysis identifies circumstances under which this additional agency cost is small, for example, the subjective information signals are precise, or the number of agents participating in the bonus pool increases. When incentive schemes can be based on both objective and subjective performance indicators, the relative weights to be placed on alternative signals are shown to differ from the ones predicted by models with objective signals only.

Based on this expression, we predict that the cost of equity is increasing in leverage, and that corporate taxes mitigate this leverage-related risk premium, while the personal tax disadvantage of debt increases this premium. We empirically test these predictions using implied cost of equity estimates and proxies for the firm's corporate tax rate and the personal tax disadvantage of debt. Our results suggest that the equity risk premium associated with leverage is decreasing in the corporate tax benefit from debt.

That is, the redaction of proprietary information from material contracts should be associated with: a larger adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread, reductions in market depth, and lower market turnover. In addition, we conjecture that the decision to redact depends on whether the firm plans on raising capital, the competitiveness of the firm's industry, and the performance of the firm. Overall the results of our analysis generally support our predictions. We find that when firms redact information, contemporaneous measures of the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread rise, and market depth and share turnover deteriorate; this suggests an increase in adverse selection.

Accounting transparency can help alleviate the agency conflict between minority investors and controlling shareholders, which is evident in the extent of ownership concentration, since the expropriation of corporate resources hinges on these private benefits remaining hidden. After controlling for other country-level and firm-level determinants, we find weak (no) evidence that extensive disclosure standards (auditor choice) reduce ownership concentration. In contrast, we report strong, robust evidence that ownership concentration is lower in countries with securities laws that specify a lower burden of proof in civil and criminal litigation against auditors, consistent with Ball's [2001] predictions. Collectively, our research implies that minority investors worldwide value legal institutions that discipline auditors in the event of financial reporting failure over both the presence of a Big 5 auditor and better disclosure standards. Re-estimating our regressions on a broad sample of western European public firms provides similar evidence on all of our predictions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00219.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['disclosure standards', 'auditor choice', 'minority investors']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting and auditing practices without a significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

The first hypothesis predicts that there will be a greater increase in audit effort and audit fees for Malaysian firms with political connections, as a result of the Asian financial crisis, than for non-politically connected firms because these firms have a higher risk of financial misstatements. The second hypothesis predicts that the audit fees of politically connected firms will decline when capital controls are introduced by the government as a ploy to financially assist politically connected firms to rebound from the crisis, and thus reduces the risk of financial misstatements. The results show that there is a greater increase in audit fees for firms with political connections than for non-politically connected firms as a result of the Asian financial crisis. However, there is a decline in audit fees for politically connected firms after the capital controls are implemented.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00220.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","4","['political connections', 'cronyism', 'financial misstatements']","The article discusses the implications of political connections and cronyism in the context of auditing and financial reporting, which touches on ethical concerns in business practices.

Analysts who issue initial optimistic earnings forecasts followed by pessimistic earnings forecasts before the earnings announcement produce more accurate earnings forecasts and are less likely to be fired by their employers. The effect of such biased earnings forecasts on forecast accuracy and firing is stronger for analysts who follow firms with heavy insider selling and hard-to-predict earnings.

Accounting for endogeneity between disclosures and trading, we find that when managers plan to purchase shares, they increase the number of bad news forecasts to reduce the purchase price. In addition, this relation is stronger for trades initiated by chief executive officers than for those initiated by other executives. Confirming this strategic behavior, we find that managers successfully time their trades around bad news forecasts, buying fewer shares beforehand and more afterwards. We do not find that managers adjust their forecasting activity when they are selling shares, consistent with higher litigation concerns associated with insider sales. Overall, our evidence suggests that insiders do exploit voluntary disclosure opportunities for personal gain, but only selectively, when litigation risk is sufficiently low.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00222.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on insider trading and voluntary disclosures with an emphasis on maximizing profits and strategic behavior, showing no evidence of socially progressive themes or ethical critiques."],["2006","44","5","JEFFREY T.

By defining the surprise relative to an analyst forecast rather than a time-series model of expected earnings, we document returns subsequent to earnings announcements that are much larger, persist for much longer, and are more heavily concentrated in the long portion of the hedge portfolio than shown in previous studies. We show that our results hold after controlling for risk and previously documented anomalies, and are positive for every quarter between 1988 and 2000. Finally, we explore the financial results and information environment of firms with extreme earnings surprises and find that they tend to be \u201cneglected\u201d stocks with relatively high book-to-market ratios, low analyst coverage, and high analyst forecast dispersion. In the three subsequent years, firms with extreme positive earnings surprises tend to have persistent earnings surprises in the same direction, strong growth in cash flows and earnings, and large increases in analyst coverage, relative to firms with extreme negative earnings surprises. We also show that the returns to the earnings surprise strategy are highest in the quartile of firms where transaction costs are highest and institutional investor interest is lowest, consistent with the idea that market inefficiencies are more prevalent when frictions make it difficult for large, sophisticated investors to exploit the inefficiencies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00223.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of stock returns and earnings surprises without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Articles based on original analysis provide new information to the markets while those that rebroadcast allegations from other intermediaries do not. Consistent with a dual role for the press, I find that business-oriented press is more likely to undertake original analysis while nonbusiness periodicals focus primarily on rebroadcasting. I also investigate the determinates of press coverage, finding systematic biases in the types of firms and frauds for which articles are published.

Capital expenditures decline with mandatory contributions to DB pension plans, even when controlling for correlations between the pension funding status itself and the firm's unobserved investment opportunities. The effect is particularly evident among firms that face financing constraints based on observable variables such as credit ratings. Investment also displays strong negative correlations with the part of mandatory contributions resulting solely from unexpected asset market movements.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00829.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate finance and investment constraints without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Evidence on Strategic Cross-Fund Subsidization","We investigate whether mutual fund families strategically transfer performance across member funds to favor those more likely to increase overall family profits. We find that \u201chigh family value\u201d funds (i.e., high fees or high past performers) overperform at the expense of \u201clow value\u201d funds. Such a performance gap is above the one existing between similar funds not affiliated with the same family. Better allocations of underpriced initial public offering deals and opposite trades across member funds partly explain why high value funds overperform. Our findings highlight how the family organization prevalent in the mutual fund industry generates distortions in delegated asset management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00830.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and strategic management without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper investigates the role of information uncertainty in price continuation anomalies and cross-sectional variations in stock returns. If short-term price continuation is due to investor behavioral biases, we should observe greater price drift when there is greater information uncertainty. As a result, greater information uncertainty should produce relatively higher expected returns following good news and relatively lower expected returns following bad news. My evidence supports this hypothesis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00831.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock price behavior and investor biases without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2006","61","1","ILAN COOPER,\u00a0\n                     ILAN COOPER\n                     Ilan Cooper is with the Department of Financial Economics, Norwegian School of Management.

If real investment is largely irreversible, the book value of assets of a distressed firm is high relative to its market value because it has idle physical capital. The firm's excess installed capital capacity enables it to fully benefit from positive aggregate shocks without undertaking costly investment. Thus, returns to equity holders of a high book-to-market firm are sensitive to aggregate conditions and its systematic risk is high. Simulations indicate that the model goes a long way toward accounting for the observed value premium.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00832.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model related to investment and asset pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Since his work, survival and price impact have been assumed to be the same. In this paper, we demonstrate that survival and price impact are two independent concepts. The price impact of irrational traders does not rely on their long-run survival, and they can have a significant impact on asset prices even when their wealth becomes negligible. We also show that irrational traders' portfolio policies can deviate from their limits long after the price process approaches its long-run limit.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00834.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of finance, specifically the behavior of irrational traders and their impact on asset prices, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2006","61","1","MARK LOEWENSTEIN,\u00a0\n                     MARK LOEWENSTEINSearch for more papers by this authorGREGORY A.

Storage allows aggregate consumption risk to differ from exogenous fundamental risk, but using aggregate consumption as a factor for asset returns can make noise trader risk superfluous. Using (i) limited asset liability and limited storage withdrawals, or (ii) an endogenous locally riskless interest rate eliminates violations of the Law of One Price.

Consistent with theory, we find that stocks with high sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average returns. Stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993, Journal of Financial Economics 25, 2349) model have abysmally low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00836.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of financial theory and stock returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2006","61","1","ALEXANDER LJUNGQVIST,\u00a0\n                     ALEXANDER LJUNGQVISTSearch for more papers by this authorFELICIA MARSTON,\u00a0\n                     FELICIA MARSTONSearch for more papers by this authorWILLIAM J.

We control for the strength of the issuer's investment banking relationships with potential competitors for the mandate, prior lending relationships, and the endogeneity of analyst behavior and the bank's decision to provide analyst coverage. Although analyst behavior was influenced by economic incentives, we find no evidence that aggressive analyst behavior increased their bank's probability of winning an underwriting mandate. The main determinant of the lead-bank choice is the strength of prior underwriting and lending relationships.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00837.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of banking relationships and analyst behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that the quadratic term structure models have serious difficulties in hedging caps and cap straddles, even though they capture bond yields well. Furthermore, at-the-money straddle hedging errors are highly correlated with cap-implied volatilities and can explain a large fraction of hedging errors of all caps and straddles across moneyness and maturities. Our results strongly suggest the existence of systematic unspanned factors related to stochastic volatility in interest rate derivatives markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00838.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling and hedging without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2006","61","1","BO BECKER,\u00a0\n                     BO BECKER\n                     Bo Becker is at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Since high wealth (excluding own-firm holdings) implies low absolute risk aversion, this is consistent with a risk aversion explanation. To examine whether wealth is likely to proxy for power, I use lagged wealth (typically measured before the CEO was hired), and the results remain for one of two incentive measures. Also, the wealth\u2013incentive result is not stronger for CEOs likely to face limited owner oversight.

We find the primary motivation for going public is to facilitate acquisitions. CFOs base IPO timing on overall market conditions, are well informed regarding expected underpricing, and feel underpricing compensates investors for taking risk. The most important positive signal is past historical earnings, followed by underwriter certification. CFOs have divergent opinions about the IPO process depending on firm-specific characteristics. Finally, we find the main reason for remaining private is to preserve decision-making control and ownership.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00840.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of initial public offerings without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Cross-sectional tests support the tax-motivated trading hypothesis. Additional tests, using trade size and pension ownership as proxies for institutional trades, yield similar results.

The number of funds used, typically between three and four, is not sensitive to the number of funds offered by the plans, which ranges from 4 to 59. A participant's propensity to allocate contributions to equity funds is not very sensitive to the fraction of equity funds among offered funds. The paper also comments on limitations on inferences from experiments and aggregate-level data analysis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00854.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of 401(k) plans and participant behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The manager needs decision-making autonomy to optimally manage the firm and thus trades off an endogenized control preference against the higher cost of capital accompanying greater managerial autonomy. Investors need liquid ownership stakes. Public capital markets provide liquidity, but stipulate corporate governance that imposes generic exogenous controls, so the manager may not attain the desired trade-off between autonomy and the cost of capital. In contrast, private ownership provides the desired trade-off through precisely calibrated contracting, but creates illiquid ownership. Exploring this tension generates new predictions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00855.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of ownership structures and decision-making autonomy without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations."],["2006","61","2","J.

We show that investors are compensated 7\u00a2 in unrealized gains for each dollar of realized capital gains, that is, $1 of realized capital gains is equivalent to 93\u00a2 of unrealized gains.

Deposit inflows provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow declines in market liquidity. Consequently, banks can insure firms against systematic declines in liquidity at lower cost than other institutions. We provide evidence that when liquidity dries up and commercial paper spreads widen, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from commercial paper backup lines without running down their holdings of liquid assets.

To test this hypothesis, we collect detailed information on the extent of hedging and on the valuation of oil and gas reserves.

These companies earn lower stock returns than firms with healthier pension plans for at least 5 years after the first emergence of the underfunding. The low returns are not explained by risk, price momentum, earnings momentum, or accruals. Further, the evidence suggests that investors do not anticipate the impact of the pension liability on future earnings, and they are surprised when the negative implications of underfunding ultimately materialize. Finally, underfunded firms have poor operating performance, and they earn low returns, although they are value companies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00859.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial performance and market efficiency related to pension plan funding without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By separating emerging market stocks into two categories, namely, those that are eligible for purchase by foreigners (accessible) and those that are not (inaccessible), we estimate and compare the degree to which accessible and inaccessible stock index returns co-move with crisis country index returns. Our results show greater co-movement during high volatility periods, especially for accessible stock index returns, suggesting that crises spread through the asset holdings of international investors rather than through changes in fundamentals.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00860.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical evidence related to stock market crises and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

When SEOs finance investment in a real options framework, expected returns decrease endogenously because growth options are converted into assets in place. Regardless of their risk, the new assets are less risky than the options they replace. Although both size and book-to-market effects are present, standard matching procedures fail to fully capture the dynamics of risk and expected return. We calibrate the model and show that it closely matches the primary features of SEO return dynamics.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00865.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a rational theory of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) and their impact on asset prices without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We extract this expectation by obtaining residual analyst coverage from a model of initial analyst following. We document that in the three subsequent years, initial public offerings with high residual coverage have significantly better returns and operating performance than those with low residual coverage.

We use prices from the grey market (the when-issued market that precedes European IPOs) to proxy for small investors' valuations. High grey market prices (indicating overoptimism) are a very good predictor of first-day aftermarket prices, while low grey market prices (indicating excessive pessimism) are not. Moreover, we find long-run price reversal only following high grey market prices. This asymmetry occurs because larger (institutional) investors can choose between keeping the shares they are allocated in the IPO, and reselling them when small investors are overoptimistic.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00870.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on investor behavior and market dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Bankruptcy costs are very heterogeneous and sensitive to the measurement method used. We find that Chapter 7 liquidations appear to be no faster or cheaper (in terms of direct expense) than Chapter 11 reorganizations.

Evidence on Dividend Preferences of Retail Investors","We study stock holdings and trading behavior of more than 60,000 households and find evidence consistent with dividend clienteles. Retail investor stock holdings indicate a preference for dividend yield that increases with age and decreases with income, consistent with age and tax clienteles, respectively. Trading patterns reinforce this evidence: Older, low-income investors disproportionally purchase stocks before the ex-dividend day. Furthermore, among small stocks, the ex-day price drop decreases with age and increases with income, consistent with clientele effects. Finally, consistent with the behavioral \u201cattention\u201d hypothesis, we document that older and low-income investors purchase stocks following dividend announcements.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00873.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dividend preferences among retail investors without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Municipal bond transaction costs decrease with trade size and do not depend significantly on trade frequency. Also, municipal bond trades are substantially more expensive than similar-sized equity trades. We attribute these results to the lack of bond market price transparency.

Moreover, tax-related underselling impacts stock prices during large earnings surprises for stocks held primarily by tax-sensitive investors. The corresponding price reactions are less negative (more positive) with higher cumulative capital gains.

Greater distance also makes them less likely to bilaterally renegotiate, and less successful at recovering defaults.

Contrary to Baker, Taliaferro, and Wurgler (2006), we show that the presence of structural breaks can lead to nonsense regressions, whether or not there is any small sample bias.

A significant inverse relation exists between bidder returns and the likelihood of CEO turnover. This relation is not associated with governance structure. It also is not significantly different in stock versus cash acquisitions, which appears to be inconsistent with Shleifer and Vishny's theory of \u201cstock market driven\u201d acquisitions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00889.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CEO turnover and bidder returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Oyer (2004, Journal of Finance 59, 1619\u20131649) posits that an absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO's reservation wages from outside employment opportunities vary with the economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer's (2004) theory.

The board's career concerns cause it to distort its investment recommendation procyclically, whereas the CEO's career concerns cause her to sometimes reduce the precision of the board's information.

This paper finds that the volatility of industrial output is lower in countries with more bank credit. Most of the reduction in volatility is idiosyncratic, which follows from the ability of banks to pool and diversify shocks. Systematic volatility is reduced less strongly. Volatility dampening is achieved via countercyclical borrowing: At the firm level, short-term borrowing is less (or more negatively) correlated with sales and inventories in countries with high levels of bank credit.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00892.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial mechanisms and their impact on industrial volatility without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2006","61","4","KEWEI HOU,\u00a0\n                     KEWEI HOUSearch for more papers by this authorDAVID T.

I use data on mutual fund holdings to construct a new measure of reference purchasing prices for individual stocks, and I show that post-announcement price drift is most severe whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The magnitude of the drift depends on the capital gains (losses) experienced by the stock holders on the event date. An event-driven strategy based on this effect yields monthly alphas of over 200 basis points.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00896.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investor behavior and market predictability without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Instead of assuming that agents are endowed with rational expectations, we model their behavior as the product of adaptive learning.

The evolutionary dominant security design calls for issuing securities that engender large losses with a small but positive probability, but that otherwise produce stable payoffs, almost the exact opposite of the pure state claims that are optimal in the rational expectations framework.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.01052.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial market behavior and security design without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, thus scoring a 1 for lack of woke content."],["2006","61","5","ROMAN INDERST,\u00a0\n                     ROMAN INDERSTSearch for more papers by this authorHOLGER M.

The largest reversals and the potential contrarian trading strategy profits occur in high turnover, low liquidity stocks, as the price pressures caused by non-informational demands for immediacy are accommodated. However, the contrarian trading strategy profits are smaller than the likely transactions costs. This lack of profitability and the fact that the overall findings are consistent with rational equilibrium paradigms suggest that the violation of the efficient market hypothesis due to short-term reversals is not so egregious after all.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.01060.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the relationship between stock liquidity and autocorrelations, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2006","61","5","MICHAEL J.

Politically connected firms are significantly more likely to be bailed out than similar nonconnected firms. Additionally, politically connected firms are disproportionately more likely to be bailed out when the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank provides financial assistance to the firm's home government. Further, among bailed-out firms, those that are politically connected exhibit significantly worse financial performance than their nonconnected peers at the time of and following the bailout. This evidence suggests that, at least in some countries, political connections influence the allocation of capital through the mechanism of financial assistance when connected companies confront economic distress.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.01000.x","articles","JF","Finance","3","['politically connected', 'bailouts', 'financial performance']","The article discusses the influence of political connections on corporate bailouts, which touches on issues of equity in financial assistance.

Because of financial market imperfections engendered by imperfect investor protection, conglomerates that engage in winner-picking (Stein, 1997 [Internal capital markets and the competition for corporate resources.

This bias for internal capital allocation can decrease allocative efficiency even when conglomerates have efficient internal capital markets, because a substantial presence of conglomerates might make it harder for other firms in the economy to raise capital. We also argue that the negative externality associated with conglomeration is particularly costly for countries that are at intermediary levels of financial development. In such countries, a high degree of conglomeration, generated, for example, by the control of the corporate sector by family business groups, could decrease the efficiency of the capital market. Our theory generates novel empirical predictions that cannot be derived in models that ignore the equilibrium effects of conglomerates.

Increases in incentive compensation tend to reduce the level of tax sheltering, in a manner consistent with a complementary relationship between diversion and sheltering. In addition, this negative effect is driven primarily by firms with relatively weak governance arrangements, confirming a central prediction of the model.

We find support for these predictions in our empirical analysis. Significant underperformers (outperformers) face higher (lower) employment risk and are more likely to issue bolder forecasts.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X05001728","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of forecasting behavior in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There are a number of reasons to suspect that it might not. Chief among them is the opaque set of accounting rules used to report pension assets, liabilities, and expenses. Pension plan assets and liabilities are off-balance sheet and are often viewed as segregated from the rest of the firm, with its own trustees. Pension accounting rules are complicated. Furthermore, the role of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation clouds the real relation between pension plan risk and firm equity risk. The empirical findings in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that equity risk does reflect the risk of the firm's pension plan despite arcane accounting rules for pensions. This finding is consistent with informational efficiency of the capital markets. It also has implications for corporate finance practice in the determination of the cost of capital for capital budgeting. Standard procedure uses de-leveraged equity return betas to infer the cost of capital for operating assets. But the de-leveraged betas are not adjusted for the risk of the pension assets and liabilities. Failure to make this adjustment typically biases upward estimates of the discount rate for capital budgeting. The magnitude of the bias is shown here to be large for a number of well-known US companies. This bias can result in positive net present value projects being rejected.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X05002370","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the relationship between equity risk and pension plan risk, without addressing social issues, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Recently, it has been argued that such indexation is not observed in the data because executives can set pay in their own interests; that is, they can enjoy \u201cpay for luck\u201d as well as \u201cpay for performance.\u201d We first show that this argument is incomplete. The positive expected return on stock markets reflects compensation for bearing systematic risk. If executives\u2019 pay is tied to market movements, they can only expect to receive the market-determined return for risk-bearing. This argument, however, assumes that executive pay is tied to bad luck as well as to good luck. If executives can truly influence the setting of their pay, they will seek to have their performance benchmarked only when it is in their interest, namely, when the benchmark has fallen. Using industry benchmarks, we find significantly less pay for luck when luck is down (in which case, pay for luck would reduce compensation) than when it is up. These empirical results are robust to a variety of alternative hypotheses and robustness checks, and they suggest that the average executive loses 25\u201345% less pay from bad luck than is gained from good luck.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X06000675","research article","JFE","Finance","2","['executive pay', 'compensation', 'market performance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of executive compensation without addressing broader social issues such as equity or ethics.

In this paper, we examine the sources behind the global diversification shareholder value loss in a contingent claims framework. This postulates that the risk-reduction effects of global diversification should decrease the value of shareholder equity (call option), whereas they should increase bondholder value. Consequently, near-all equity globally diversified firms should not experience a shareholder value loss. Consistent with the risk-reduction effects of global diversification, using cross-border acquisitions data we find three major results. First, shareholder value loss to global diversification is directly related to firms' leverage. Second, near-all equity firms do not trade at a discount. Third, the use of book value debt in estimating excess value produces a downward bias in globally diversified firms. Our findings confirm that increased foreign involvement increases bondholder value while it decreases shareholder value. This is consistent with the contingent claims view predicting that global diversification has a positive impact on bondholders' wealth while it has a negative influence on shareholder value (i.e., global diversification discount). Overall, our results reveal that global diversification does not destroy firm value.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400203","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of global diversification without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our results support the hypothesis of a significant unconditional exchange risk premium in emerging stock markets, differently from most unconditional tests for major developed markets. However, there is indication that at the aggregate market level the significance of the exchange risk factor is subsumed by local market risk. With firm-level data, although the importance of local market is confirmed for most countries, some measure of exchange rate risk remains significant for most countries. This suggests that a careful model specification is necessary for EMs when testing for the pricing of exchange risk in order to avoid a potential spurious significance of such factor because of a missing local risk or vice versa.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400204","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of exchange risk in emerging markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We discuss four conceptual channels through which history matters, illustrating each with a major example. First, historical variation is at least a worthy complement to contemporary cross-sectional variation in illuminating conceptual issues. As an example, we show that conclusions reached by the literature on contemporary emerging market business groups are remarkably similar to independently reached conclusions about a very similar organizational form that was ubiquitous in the age of empire. Second, historical evidence avoids spurious labeling of some phenomena as \u2018new\u2019, and by so doing may challenge current explanations of their determinants. Whereas some firm types today were also present earlier, some types have disappeared, some have appeared, and some have disappeared and reappeared later. Third, history can allow us to move beyond the oft-recognized importance of issues of path dependence to explore the roots of Penrosian resources. We argue that the choices made by Jardine's and Swire's in Asia today, for example, are an outgrowth of strategic choices first in evidence more than a century ago. These would remain obscured absent an historical analysis. Fourth, there are certain issues that are unaddressable, except in the really long (that is, historical) run. Exploring the causal relationship (if any) between foreign direct investment, a staple of the international business literature, and long-run economic development provides one important example. Throughout, we advocate embracing rigorous methods for analyzing small-sample and qualitative data when conventional regression techniques do not apply. That is, we suggest that re-embracing history in the mainstream is not tantamount to sacrificing methodological rigor.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400198","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['history', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'strategic choices']","The article discusses the importance of historical context in international business, which touches on broader themes of understanding past injustices and their implications today.

Both Chinese and American executives felt tension during the negotiations. For the Chinese, greater levels of tension led to an increased likelihood of agreement, but also led to lower levels of interpersonal attraction and in turn lower trust for their American counterparts. For the Americans, tension felt decreased marginally the likelihood of an agreement, did not affect interpersonal attraction, but did have a direct negative effect on trust.

We argue that when perceived corruption in the business segment increases, an MNE's propensity to cooperate and be assertive with the government decreases, its focus on ethics heightens, and its philanthropic contribution diminishes. As to the three-way interactions, when perceived corruption in the business segment increases, MNEs that focus more on ethics have a greater propensity to use arm's length bargaining to deal with the government, whereas those focusing less on ethics have a greater propensity to use social connections to deal with the government.

The empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically, the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), is significantly related to market value of equity. Yet news about ACSI results does not move share prices. This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested, and the second is an actual case.

When a pioneer starts a new market with a really new product, it can be a major challenge just to survive. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, market pioneer survival risks are much lower. Notably, early followers have the same survival risk across both types of markets.

The relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is of central interest to research in organizational psychology. However, empirical research in that area finds that the link between these constructs is weak at best. A negative effect of effort on job satisfaction is consistent with agency theory, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this assumption. Moreover, some studies have found a positive effect of effort on job satisfaction. Using a model that incorporates the main constructs from agency theory and organizational psychology, the current study finds a negative, direct effect of effort and a positive, direct effect of job performance on job satisfaction. The authors show that conflicting findings in the literature are the result of inconsistency in both the measurement and the definition of constructs across studies that do not fully account for all the relationships between constructs. The current findings emphasize the need to distinguish clearly between factors that represent employees' inputs in a work relationship (i.e., effort) and those that represent their outputs (i.e., job performance).

Thus, the authors simultaneously model the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the product's value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design in a new product category.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.70.2.001","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product design emergence and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Rather, the authors find that the driving force behind escalation behavior is improper use of initial positive beliefs in the face of negative new information. This insight has implications for the groundwork necessary for organizations to design systems, policies, and procedures to help them avoid the trap of escalation bias that is often associated with major strategic decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.70.2.108","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['escalation bias', 'commitment', 'decision involvement']","The article focuses primarily on decision-making processes and biases in management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

These approaches use CLV to develop a rank order of customers and recommend devoting more resources to customers with higher ranks. However, it has been discussed in the literature that a simple net present value analysis may not reflect the value of the flexibility to make such decisions. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of a real-options analysis in certain situations. Building on this stream of research and using the case of the option to abandon unprofitable customers, this article proposes an approach that combines real-options analysis and CLV; this approach explicitly values the seller's flexibility to abandon unprofitable customers. Using a combination of examples, empirical analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, the authors provide evidence that the divergence between CLV that includes and CLV that excludes option value can be substantial and may not be the same for all customers. Therefore, the authors conclude that a distribution of customers based on CLV can change when option value is included. Thus, using CLV as a basis for marketing decisions but not including the value of the option to make such decisions a priori when calculating CLV can lead to an overall biased result.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.70.3.005","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer lifetime value and decision-making in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with theory in environmental psychology, the author predicts that such ambient scents can elicit emotional responses that can influence subsequent judgments, but only when specific conditions are met. Three factors are hypothesized to moderate the effects of pleasant ambient scents on evaluations: (1) the congruence of the scent with the product, (2) the salience of the scent, and (3) consumers\u2019 motivation to correct for extraneous influences. The findings of three experiments suggest that as long as ambient scents are congruent with the product, they continue to affect consumers\u2019 evaluations, even when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated to correct for extraneous influences. In addition, as long as the scent is not completely incongruent with the product, noncongruent scents are corrected for only when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated.

This research suggests that adoption is rarely a neutral process and that consumers can experience strong emotions in the initial use of innovations. However, given such emotions, two opposing arguments can be made as to whether the inclusion of emotional responses increases the predictive power of traditional models of diffusion. On the one hand, experienced emotion may simply be a function of gained benefits and, as such, may already be captured in extant models through cognitive assessments of net benefits. On the other hand, and as data from two empirical and longitudinal studies demonstrate, the learning process is potentially emotion generating (independent of net benefits), and this emotion colors product evaluations.

The authors posit that activation can have several different outcomes, including reinforcement of an existing dominant role or actual switching to a new one. Theoretically, the conceptual framework allows for integration of different perspectives on interfirm relationships, some of which have provided seemingly inconsistent accounts of firm behavior. From a managerial perspective, the framework identifies specific matches between particular relationship roles on the one hand and firms\u2019 governance strategies on the other hand. In general, the framework suggests that an in-depth understanding of roles is a prerequisite for the deployment of relationship management initiatives toward resellers, customers, and suppliers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.70.3.090","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['relationship roles', 'governance strategies', 'decision logics']","The article discusses relationship roles and governance strategies in marketing, which touches on ethical considerations in business interactions.

A prominent example of dual distribution includes business format franchising, in which firms (i.e., the franchisors) license the operation of some of their units to franchisees while owning and operating some units themselves. Despite the widespread prevalence of dual distribution, there are few insights into its performance implications. In this article, the author examines the relationship between a firm's dual distribution strategy and its intangible value. Franchising in restaurant chains serves as the empirical context for the study. It is proposed that a firm's dual distribution strategy affects its intangible value both independently and jointly with a set of firm characteristics. The author considers the firm's age, scope of vertical integration, advertising, financial leverage, and financial liquidity as firm characteristics that influence the relationship between dual distribution strategy and intangible value. The author measures the firm's dual distribution strategy by the proportion of its franchised units to its total units and intangible value by its Tobin's q. The author estimates the proposed model using panel data on 55 publicly listed U.S. restaurant chains for the period 1992\u20132002. Unobserved firm heterogeneity is accommodated using latent class regression analysis. The results support a four-segment model.

Contrary to the assumptions of practitioners and academic modelers, these inventory estimates, not actual inventory levels, drive subsequent purchase incidence. Simulation results further show that biased estimates increase overstocking and spoilage among stockout-averse consumers but increase stockouts and unmet demand among overstocking-averse consumers.

The findings yield three insights for reference price advertising. First, reference pricing results in favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions only when consumers are shopping for a product. Second, when consumers are shopping for a product, reference pricing paired with limited-time availability results in more favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions than the use of either technique alone.

It is proposed that regulatory fit changes the significance of consumers' reactions to something, including the perceived monetary value of a choice they have made or the persuasiveness of a message they have received. When there is a fit, people engage more strongly in and \u201cfeel right\u201d about what they are doing, and subsequent evaluative reactions (positive or negative) can be intensified by this fit experience. The fit experience is shown to influence the strength of value experiences independent of hedonic experiences.

In the first two studies, the author finds evidence of more relational behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) and higher motivation levels regarding purchase (Study 2) among self-determined (versus firm-determined) customers. This article also examines how customers' self-determination interacts with two types of relational marketing programs: reminder coupons, which consumers view as relatively more controlling, and relational rewards, which they view as relatively more informative of their value to the firm. The results reveal that sending a stylized reminder coupon to encourage repeat purchase has negative effects (Study 3) and that automatic enrollment in a relational rewards program has positive effects on relational behaviors of self-determined customers (Study 4). Firm-determined customers are less influenced by rewards in both cases. These findings question the effectiveness of aggressive acquisition and reminder marketing programs in cultivating customer relationships, provide a straightforward way to identify attractive relational candidates in consumer settings, and suggest methods by which to (and how not to) market to self-determined consumers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.109","research article","JMR","Marketing","4","['self-determination', 'relational marketing', 'consumer behavior']","The article discusses self-determination in the context of consumer behavior, which touches on themes of autonomy and empowerment, relevant to DEI.

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have followed since 1968.

Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real caf\u00e9 reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting \u201cbonus\u201d stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a \u201cregular\u201d 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program.

Instead, information is available only for each set separately along with some other set of common variables. The standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without including the common variables. This is the object required for marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete variables is required. The authors develop a method for relaxing the assumption of conditional independence for this case.

The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables and advertising/individual browsing variables.

However, there is no empirical research on this issue because of the difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all new products that were offered to one retailer for a period of nine months, the authors empirically investigate support for the alternative rationales for slotting allowances. The analysis indicates that, in general, there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the anticompetitive theories. The authors find that slotting allowances (1) efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space, (2) help balance the risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers, (3) help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of new products, and (4) widen retail distribution for manufacturers by mitigating retail competition.

The authors show that when the service differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.156","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on price-matching guarantees and competitive strategies among retailers without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article examines how standards competition affects consumer behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements\u2014negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion\u2014disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3). This research takes a step toward a better understanding of these important but underexplored issues and provides managerial insights for firms that launch new products in markets with competing standards.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.224","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of standards competition and consumer behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in the literature) to drive recall and persuasion are effective at driving perceptions of similarity. This is of practical importance because managers want their advertisements not only to be liked and remembered but also (possibly) to be perceived as similar (or dissimilar) to those for other products.

Marketing models are usually applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing. Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium, allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and for psychologists who prize realism.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.307","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['behavioral economics', 'consumer behavior', 'social preferences']","The article discusses behavioral economics and its implications for understanding consumer behavior, which touches on social preferences.

The author raises two general questions about such models. The first question is whether behavioral economics is, in reality, a new form of theoretical psychology, competing with existing psychological models and theories and subject to the same vulnerability to evidence as applies to psychological theory. The author argues that behavioral economists are ambivalent about this point, sometimes claiming psychological realism or plausibility as a necessary modeling requirement and other times introducing assumptions for modeling convenience. The second question is whether the impact of behavioral economics on marketing will be experienced more strongly through the development of new quantitative models or through the exploration of qualitative lessons stimulated by behavioral violations of rationality.

However, in more complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that result in selective attention to a subset of the information available, continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different respondents.

Brands in categories that are characterized by high price differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find significant effects for the cumulative elasticity. The immediate effect of a regular price change is often close to zero. The long-term effect of such a regular price decrease usually amounts to an increase in sales.

Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the planning horizon of the predominant interaction does not typically coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5) periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within a category. The authors conclude by discussing several practical marketing applications for which marketing decisions across frequencies have relevance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.477","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and empirical analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this research, the authors study the ability of firms to convert ideas into products, that is, their conversion ability. Specifically, they address the question, Why are some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between 1960 and 2001 from a cross-national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate for a moderate length of time on promising ideas.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.494","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product development and conversion ability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit impact. Deep, featured promotions on high \u201cconsumer-pull\u201d brands generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact. Therefore, the retailer must make some difficult trade-offs between revenue and profit objectives in promotion decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.518","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on quantifying promotional impacts on profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

On an aggregate level, a major assortment reduction can lead to substantive short-term category sales losses but only a weak negative long-term category sales effect. Short-term category sales losses are caused mainly by fewer category purchases by former buyers of delisted detergent items. However, the results also show that the assortment reduction attracts new category buyers. These new buyers partially offset the sales losses among former buyers of the delisted items.

The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning system.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.564","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of marketing and sales coordination to improve revenue and profit, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To enhance understanding of this issue, the authors examine the role of buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships using data collected in the context of actual new product selection by retail buyers at two large grocery retailers in the United States. The findings indicate that buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships have a greater influence on new product acceptance when a new product's attractiveness is modest than when the new product is very unattractive or very attractive.

In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related \u201chard-part\u201d product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cBetter,\u201d \u201cBest\u201d); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter to previous grocery retailing-based findings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.588","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and profit optimization in the automotive retail sector without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2006","43","4","Brian Wansink Wansink@Cornell.edu and Pierre Chandon pierre.chandon@insead.edu","Can \u201cLow-Fat\u201d Nutrition Labels Lead to Obesity?","In this era of increasing obesity and increasing threats of legislation and regulation of food marketing practices, regulatory agencies have pointedly asked how \u201clow-fat\u201d nutrition claims may influence food consumption.

The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals, particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals, leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn, this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic goals.

Additional studies show that screening encourages decision makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and 4).

Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages.

In this paper we compare the performances of four different efficient implementations of algorithms for MCF under cost reoptimization in the context of decomposition algorithms for the multicommodity min-cost flow (MMCF) problem, showing that for some classes of instances the relative performances of the codes doing \u201cfrom-scratch\u201d optimization do not accurately predict the relative performances when reoptimization is used.

The first model is a relaxation of the layout problem and is intended to find good starting points for the iterative algorithm used to solve the second model. The second model is an exact formulation of the facility-layout problem as a nonconvex mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Aspect ratio constraints, which are frequently used in facility-layout methods to restrict the occurrence of overly long and narrow departments in the computed layouts, are easily incorporated into this new framework. Finally, we present computational results showing that the complete framework can be solved efficiently using widely available optimization software, and the resulting layouts improve on those obtained using previous approaches in the literature. Moreover, the framework can be used to find different competitive layouts with relatively little computational effort, which is advantageous for a user who wishes to consider several competitive layouts rather than simply using a mathematically optimal layout.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0103","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical framework for solving a mathematical problem related to facility layout design, with no mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The problem we address is that of minimizing the makespan of n tasks on m identical machines (or processors), where tasks are nonpreemptive and follow a precedence order. The proposed approach exploits the observation that a nongreedy search heuristic often finds better solutions than do their greedy counterparts. We hypothesize that combinations of nongreedy and greedy heuristics when integrated with an augmented neural-network approach can lead to better solutions than can either one alone. We show the formulation of such integration and provide empirical results on over a thousand problems. This approach is found to be very robust in that the results were not very sensitive to the type of greedy heuristic chosen. The new approach is able to find solutions, on average, within 1.8% to 2.8% of the lower bound compared to 2.0% to 8.3% for the greedy-only AugNN approach. This improvement is obtained without any increase in computational complexity. In fact the number of iterations used to find the solution decreased.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0108","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to task scheduling using neural networks without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Some instances of these problems involve millions of constraints and tens of millions of variables. Classical formulations focus on modeling the physical problem alone. In this paper, we focus on modeling the organization of information and decisions, producing a natural decomposition based on how decisions are actually made. Restricting the size of a subproblem to the sizes of problems actually solved by real decision makers, we avoid the computational demands posed by large problems. The algorithmic challenge is producing high quality solutions that reflect the interaction between subproblems. Linear approximations have been a widely used tool for decomposition, but these can produce unstable solutions of only moderate quality. We introduce the concept of using nonlinear approximations, which creates special technical problems but also produces solutions of very high quality. The strategy is simulated on two problem classes (fleet management and supply chains) and compared against standard modeling strategies. Synchronous and asynchronous strategies are also compared.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0111","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While this lowers inventory costs, the negative effect of increased stockouts is to reduce net demand for the product. We analyze the effect of offering a lower price during stockout to compensate for a customer\u2019s waiting time, using an EOQ-type inventory-modeling framework but solving simultaneously for both the optimal prices and the lengths of the in-stock and stockout periods. The lower price recaptures some lost demand and has an important synergistic effect: the increased sales rate leads to lower unit costs for inventory holding and product ordering. Stockout compensation improves market efficiency and increases the retailer\u2019s sales and profit. The optimal stockout-compensation policy is to choose period lengths and prices such that the two periods have equal effective prices (i.e., the optimal stockout compensation equals the average waiting cost for a customer). Compared with the pure wait-free and stockless-operation policies, stockout compensation not only yields greater profits, but also greater revenues, lower unit costs, and increased consumer surplus and market coverage. Compared with a backorder policy without compensation, the stockout compensation policy improves profits and social welfare but at the expense of consumer surplus. Allowing for strategic consumer behavior under knowledge of future prices, the equal-effective-prices solution defines a rational-expectations equilibrium.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0091","","JOC","Information Systems","2","['social welfare', 'consumer surplus', 'market efficiency']","The article focuses primarily on inventory management and pricing strategies within e-commerce, with only a minor mention of social welfare and consumer surplus.

Unfortunately, OO technologies, though they add tremendous functionality and flexibility to applications, require significant computational power, which greatly affects the performance and scalability of the applications. Caching objects in memory is a popular way to solve this problem, but the available memory in systems is limited and not sufficient to store each instance of every enterprise application object. Deciding which instances of which objects should be cached is a two-stage process. The first stage is selecting the objects, and the second stage is selecting the object instances. The second stage, typically referred to as a replacement policy, occurs at run-time and has been widely studied. The focus of this paper is the first stage: selecting objects whose instances are candidates for caching at run-time. In current systems, this critical step is performed in an ad hoc manner.

Due to the sheer complexity of the problem, optimizing the connectivity between transistors is very difficult. The circuit interconnection is the single most important factor in performance criteria such as signal delay, power dissipation, circuit size, and cost. These factors dictate that interconnections, i.e., wires, be made as short as possible. The wire-minimization problem is generally formulated as a sequence of discrete optimization subproblems that are known to be NP-hard. Hence, they can only be solved approximately using meta-heuristics. These methods are computationally expensive and the quality of the solution depends to a great extent on an appropriate choice of starting configuration and modeling techniques. In this paper, new modeling techniques are used to solve the routing problem formulated as an integer programming problem. The main contribution of this paper is a proposed global routing heuristic that combines the wire length, channel congestion, and number of pins in routes to find the best wiring layout of a circuit. By adding information such as channel congestion and the number of pins in each route as well as the wire length, the quality of the solution is improved. In addition, the solutions of the large relaxed linear programming problems are skewed towards a zero-one solution, resulting in faster convergence. The developed LP models in this paper are useful when solving the global routing problem for two reasons; first, the new interior-point algorithms to solve the LP problem are polynomial in time. Second, \u201cnear optimal wiring\u201d is obtained in polynomial time without performing randomized rounding.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0127","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of circuit design and optimization, with no mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Performance (e.g., client-perceived latency) of these systems becomes a major concern. Previous research has explored techniques for scaling up the number of storage servers involved to enhance the performance of network storage systems. However, adding servers to improve system performance is an expensive solution. Moreover, for a WAN-based network storage system, the bottleneck for its performance improvement typically is not caused by the load of storage servers, but by the network traffic between clients and storage servers.

The proposed algorithm is based on circuit-reduction techniques obtained through nonlinear-projection approaches. The main idea in the proposed sensitivity-computation algorithm is based on projecting the adjoint system of equations onto a subspace of smaller dimension.

Objects are represented as vertices and the relationships between them are represented as nets (edges that connect two or more vertices) in the form of a hypergraph. We seek a placement of vertices that groups like objects and separates unlike objects. This involves separating related objects into a few, possibly disjoint, blocks. These hypergraph-partitioning problems are NP-hard so cannot be solved exactly, except for very small instances. We develop and use a numerical technique based on eigenvector decomposition of the connectivity matrix associated with the circuit netlist to partition hypergraphs emanating from circuit netlists. The eigenvector components of the circuit connectivity matrix are then used to determine vertex coordinates in one dimension that are then rounded in some fashion to determine block assignments. The inherent difficulty with eigenvector techniques is that the eigenvector components tend to cluster, making it difficult to determine correct block assignments. Our technique uses weights on nets, vertices, and fixed vertices to obtain a more \u201cdiscrete\u201d placement of vertices, making it easier to determine correct block assignments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0154","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to circuit partitioning using mathematical techniques without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The ESPPRC often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). As the ESPPRC problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC), which can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes impractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving ESPPRC and SPPRC is to forbid cycles of small length. In the SPPRC with k-cycle elimination (SPPRC-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k + 1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i \u2212 j \u2212 i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k \u2265 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard VRPTW instances from Solomon\u2019s benchmark show that k-cycle elimination with k \u2265 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints. The new algorithm has proven to be a key ingredient for getting exact integer solutions for well-known hard problems from the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0117","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in optimization related to vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An exact branch and cut algorithm is presented based on the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem. In the preprocessing stage, lower bounds on the distance between each pair of precedence-constrained activities are derived. These bounds are used to reduce the number of variables in the model and to generate cuts that tighten the linear programming relaxation. The solution process is accelerated by an adaptive branching scheme in conjunction with a bound-tightening scheme that is called iteratively after branching. To find good feasible solutions in the early stages of the computations, a high-level neighborhood search strategy known as local branching is included. Here, a neighborhood of a feasible solution is defined by the linear inequalities in the ILP model and is searched first. As implemented, the full algorithm is exact rather than heuristic in nature. Numerical results are reported for 20- and 30-activity benchmark problems. These are the largest instances available and are generally viewed to be notoriously difficult. Up until now, there were no confirmed optimal solutions for any of the 552 30-activity instances.

This investigation presents a net-revenue maximization model that can help a network planner with the selection of tower sites and the calculation of service capacity. The integer programming model takes as input a set of candidate tower locations with corresponding costs, a number of customer locations with corresponding demand for traffic, and the revenue potential for each unit of capacity allocated to each demand point. Based on these data, the model can be used to determine the selection of radio towers and the service capacity of the resulting radio network. The basic model is a large integer program and requires a special algorithm for practical solution. Our algorithm uses a priority branching scheme, an optimization-gap tolerance between 1% and 10%, and two sets of global valid inequalities that tighten the upper bounds obtained from the linear programming relaxation. The algorithm has been implemented in software for the AMPL/CPLEX system and an empirical investigation has been conducted. Using over 300 problem instances with up to 40 towers and 250 service locations, various combinations of algorithm settings have been evaluated. Using the recommended setting results in a design tool that generally runs in under 20 minutes on a 667 MHz AlphaStation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0129","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network design and optimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Most existing research considers caching to occur independently at the browser and the proxy server. When the browser and the proxy-server cache independently, documents may get duplicated across the two levels. This paper analyzes the impact of document duplication on the performance of several browser-proxy caching policies. We first derive an exact expression and an accurate approximation for the delay under a joint browser-proxy caching policy in which no duplication is permitted. This policy is compared to a base or benchmark policy in which caching occurs independently at the two levels, and hence, duplication of documents is freely permitted. We next propose a more general caching policy in which a controlled amount of duplication is permitted. This policy is analyzed and an exact expression and an approximate expression for performance are derived. Finally, a simulation study is performed to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical results and extend these results for situations that are difficult to analyze mathematically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0118","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of browser and proxy caching without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the CVRP, the demands of a set of customers have to be met at minimum total travel cost using vehicles of identical capacity based at a single depot. The potential of maximally violated mod-p cutting-planes (Caprara et al. 2000) for the CVRP is investigated via a computational study. The foundation of the assessment is formed by classes of problem-specific constraints taken from the literature. In several separation algorithms for the CVRP, it is advantageous to shrink inclusionwise maximal minimum-weight cuts in support graphs as preprocessing. It is mentioned how a partition of the set of customers into such mincuts can be computed in a fast and elegant way using the mincut algorithm of Hao and Orlin (1994). Interestingly, maximally violated mod-p cuts, which are general-purpose cuts of Chv\u00e1tal-Gomory type, stand comparison with problem-specific cuts for the CVRP and they are clearly useful on top of such cuts. The first-time proven optimal solution of the CVRP instance B-n68-k9 is reported. The computation used a branching strategy with far lookahead and relied on maximally violated mod-p cuts. This paper on maximally violated cuts belongs to a set of papers originating from Applegate et al.

Given a Laplace transform \\hat{f} of a complex-valued function of a nonnegative real-variable, f, the function f is approximated by a finite linear combination of the transform values; i.e., we use the inversion formula f(t) \\approx f_n (t) \\equiv \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{k = 0}^{n}\\omega_{k}\\hat{f}\\biggl(\\frac{\\alpha_{k}}{t}\\biggr),\\quad 0 < t < \\infty, where the weights \u03c9k and nodes \u03b1k are complex numbers, which depend on n, but do not depend on the transform \\hat{f} or the time argument t. Many different algorithms can be put into this framework, because it remains to specify the weights and nodes. We examine three one-dimensional inversion routines in this framework: the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, a version of the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, and a version of the Talbot algorithm, which is based on deforming the contour in the Bromwich inversion integral. We show that these three building blocks can be combined to produce different algorithms for numerically inverting two-dimensional Laplace transforms, again all depending on the single parameter n. We show that it can be advantageous to use different one-dimensional algorithms in the inner and outer loops.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0137","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for numerical algorithms without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Under stochastic demand modeled using scenarios, we maximize the expected demand coverage subject to a budget constraint on hub installation, and technological constraints on demand coverage by installed hubs. There are multiple hub types, differing in costs and capacities. We present a practical greedy heuristic based on the budgeted maximum-coverage problem and analyze its worst-case performance. For special cases with a single hub type or a single demand scenario, we show that a guarantee of 1 \u2212 1/e or 63.2% applies to our greedy heuristic. For the general case we develop a data-dependent performance guarantee. Through computational experiments, we show that the greedy heuristic\u2019s empirical performance is, on average, within 2% of the optimal expected demand coverage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0143","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses purely on a quantitative model for telecommunications without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on a particular kind of search constraint, the k-discrepancy constraint appearing in discrepancy-based search. The property that a node has an associated discrepancy k can be modeled (and enforced) through a linear constraint. Our key result is the exploitation of the k-discrepancy constraint to improve the bound given by any relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem through the additive bounding technique (Fischetti and Toth 1989). We show how this simple idea can be effectively exploited to tighten relaxations in CP solvers and speed up the proof of optimality by performing a large variety of computational experiments on test problems involving the AllDifferent constraint. In this view, the additive bounding technique represents a non-trivial link between search and bound. Moreover, such a technique is general because it does not depend on either the AllDifferent constraint or the discrepancy search technique.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0168","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of search constraints and optimization techniques without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Contextual, configurational, and levels-of-analysis issues","Are lean production jobs intrinsically motivating? More than 20 years after the arrival of lean production, this question remains unresolved. Generally accepted models of job design such as the Job Characteristics Model (JCM, (Hackman, J.R., Oldham, G.R. 1976. Motivation through the design of work: test of a theory. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance 16, 250\u2013279.)) cannot explain the occurrence of worker intrinsic motivation in the context of lean production. In this paper, we extend the JCM to the lean production context to explain the theoretical relationship between job characteristics and motivational outcomes in lean production. We suggest that a configuration of lean production practices is more important for worker intrinsic motivation than are independent main effects, and that motivation may be limited by excessive leanness. We conclude that lean production job design may engender worker intrinsic motivation; however, there are likely to be substantial differences in intrinsic motivation under differing lean production configurations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['motivation', 'job design', 'lean production']","The article focuses primarily on job design and motivation within lean production, lacking significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This industry has been growing for the past 5 years at greater than 25% per year while the overall market for foodstuffs has been largely stagnant. The research utilizes data from surveys of over 2100 customers of five different home delivery grocers. The analysis utilizes two group variables (customer experience level and order picking method) and five primary constructs (service quality, product quality, product freshness, time-savings and behavioral intentions). The results indicate that customer perceptions of the primary constructs generally improve as they gain experience with this new method of ordering and receiving groceries. Furthermore, the operational choice of picking method is also shown to have a large impact on customer perceptions\u2014in particular, more experienced customers generally rate the primary constructs higher for distribution center (DC)-based picking than for store-based picking. The study provides support for the hypothesis that direct to customer foodstuffs can be of better freshness and quality when picked from a DC because of the ability to shorten the supply chain than from a store. The data suggest that a DC-based picking strategy is viable if grocers can re-shape customer perceptions and master the numerous intricacies of the supply chain.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.04.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer behavior and operational efficiency in online grocery shopping, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The implications of overlooking fundamental assumptions of SEM and ignoring serious methodological issues are presented along with guidelines for improving future applications of SEM in OM research.

While the beneficial impact of supply chain agility is generally acknowledged, very little research exists to date addressing how an organization can achieve supply chain agility. This study first presents a framework of an organization's supply chain process flexibilities as an important antecedent of its supply chain agility, and then establishes the key factors that determine the flexibility attributes of the three critical processes of the supply chain\u2014procurement/sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution/logistics. Using empirical data, we develop flexibility and agility scales related to our supply chain agility model, and then test the model. Findings reveal that supply chain agility of a firm is directly and positively impacted by the degree of flexibility present in the manufacturing and procurement/sourcing processes of the supply chain; while it is indirectly impacted by the level of flexibility within its distribution/logistics process. The results also support our view that a firm's supply chain agility is impacted by the synergy among the three process flexibilities in its internal supply chain.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.05.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain agility and flexibility without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or DEI themes.

Is focus\u2014or unfocus\u2014a strategic choice, best practice or perhaps a reflection of an environmental constraint? In his pioneering work, Skinner [W. Skinner, 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113\u2013121] prescribes companies to ensure that the manufacturing task of their manufacturing units is simple and focused, for instance, by assigning a narrow product mix for each factory or concentrating on a narrow mix of production technologies. Especially in the absence of compelling empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the focused factory approach, we argue that we still do not understand why some plants may remain unfocused.\n            \n            We observe that in the international process industry case examined in this paper, some factories are unfocused and their manufacturing tasks are all but simple. Yet, some of them appear to be high performers. This presents an opportunity to seek empirical insight on the questions raised above. Specifically, we examine why manufacturing companies in the process industries may or may not follow the focused factory strategy. Our results suggest that in certain operating environments and with certain competitive strategies, choosing not to focus the manufacturing task should be viewed as a viable alternative manufacturing strategy, perhaps even a constraint imposed by the operating environment. We develop four contingency propositions to explain why focused manufacturing strategy may not be desirable or even possible.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.011","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational strategies within manufacturing without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This exploratory study investigates re-use issues and practices related to process industry firms\u2014from the producer's perspective\u2014with the objective of identifying important issues that need further research in the field. Site visits were conducted to identify and clarify re-use issues unique to process industry firms for the purpose of developing a mail survey instrument. The mail survey provided detailed information about the sources of returned product and materials and the subsequent re-use decisions made by 141 different manufacturing facilities in a wide variety of process industries including chemicals, food, rubber, and plastics. Results indicate that process industry firms are quite diverse, that some common beliefs about re-use in process industry firms do not apply to all process types in these industries, and that research efforts are needed in the areas of network design and product acquisition; inventory; production planning and control; and scheduling. The paper concludes by identifying specific research questions important to re-use in process industry environments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.012","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['re-use', 'waste disposal', 'sustainability', 'environment']","The article discusses re-use issues and waste disposal in process industries, indicating a focus on sustainability and environmental concerns.

The problem considered is that of finding the best bottling alternative for produced batches when these have to undergo several lengthy quality tests related to the foregoing production processes. Produced batches can be bottled directly after production when the results of these test are completely unknown, after some positive (intermediate) test results are known, or after all test have been completed with positive results. When waiting in order to be bottled, a batch has to stay in the production tank. Alternatives that start the bottling process quickly after production have the advantages of a relatively low tank capacity requirement and of a relatively small flow time if all test results are positive. However, a produced batch can only be reworked as long as it has not been bottled. So fast bottling reduces the possibilities for rework and therefore reduces the production yield. We present performance measures for comparing the different alternatives and derive closed form expressions for them. We also present the results obtained for the considered case.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bottling alternatives in pharmaceutical production without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2006","24","3","David L.

When setting up a production schedule, planners must consider the effects of off-grade production and production rate penalties, which are typically sequence-dependent as products are transitioned from one to another, as well as inventory holding costs and capacity constraints. We call this the continuous economic lot sizing and scheduling problem (CELSP) to distinguish it from closely related problems found in discrete part production industries. We present a formulation that addresses the particular aspects of the CELSP and apply the proposed mathematical modeling approach to several plants of a chemical processing company. This company was concerned with ensuring the plants were carrying proper amounts of inventory and with evaluating the number of products produced at each plant. Our results show actual overall inventory levels were close to the levels suggested by our model and therefore company plans for further inventory reductions would not be appropriate. However, the company should carefully consider the addition of new products to current plant product slates. Due to the effects of product transitions and inventory levels, even adding products with significant contribution margins may negatively affect the financial performance of the plant.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.009","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory management and production scheduling in the chemical process industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose a planning framework that can help to analyze the flexibility of the planning.

In recent years, however, the introduction of internet-based, online library catalog systems has allowed users to search the library's catalog, select and reserve a book or a video and have it delivered to the branch of their choice. Consequently, the demand for delivery services is increasing at rapid rate in large urban public libraries systems.\n            \n            Having experienced a similar growth in the demand for delivered items, the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) commissioned a study to improve its delivery operations. Using operations management concepts, such as pre-sorting of material to avoid double handling, cross docking to reduce cycle time of delivery, and workload balancing among delivery routes to effectively increase delivery capacity, the delivery operations were restructured. We developed optimization models for library delivery operations that specifically accounted for pre-sorting, cross docking and route balancing. We also developed heuristics for solving these models and implemented them to redesign the delivery operations at SFPL.\n            \n            The redesigned delivery operations will reduce the cycle time and the cost of delivery by almost half. Furthermore, through balanced utilization of existing truck capacities, the delivery operations will be able to handle significantly larger delivery volume and thereby accommodate future delivery service growth without additional investments. The operations management concepts and techniques illustrated in this paper through the example of SFPL should prove to be useful to other urban, multi-branch library systems as they deal with their delivery challenges.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.017","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical improvements in delivery operations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely operational and profit-oriented approach."],["2006","24","4","David M.

Two decision-making roles are studied: executives, those with the authority to start or cancel a project, and project managers, those who direct the day-to-day operations of the project. Our exploratory survey research, an initial step in this topic, suggests that different roles cluster critical termination factors uniquely and use different decision weighting levels on these factors. On a second construct, information gathering actions, such as scanning and interpretation, show an indication of bias, particularly sunk cost bias, and this bias is experienced differently by executives and project managers. Interestingly, the scale of a project, in terms of labor-hours, calendar time, or budget, does not appear to be related to perception of \u2018failure\u2019. The implications for the management of government safety projects are that care must be taken to understand the differing viewpoints of the two types of decision-makers and that the initial presentation of information concerning a project may influence the perception of a project's outcome. While there are several implications for operations management research, the most critical is that care must be given when surveying \u201cmanagers\u201d concerning subjective measures of \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019 as there can be radical perceptual differences by role.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.12.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['bias', 'decision-making', 'perception']","The article discusses decision-making roles and biases in project termination, hinting at ethical considerations in management practices.

In not-for-profit, public, and government services, it is common for labor to include unpaid volunteers. This article demonstrates how the volunteer labor assignment (VLA) problem is markedly different from traditional labor assignment (TLA) problems such as labor scheduling. One core difference pertains to the cost structure of labor, where TLA problems seek to minimize labor costs, yet labor costs for volunteers are usually trivial. Another difference is the assumed size of the labor pool: TLA typically assumes sufficient labor to cover task requirements, whereas the VLA labor pool is limited by the number of volunteers that can be recruited. These and other distinctions coming from the volunteerism literature are described and confirmed with empirical data. One important finding is that volunteers who were not utilized had a reduced propensity to volunteer in the future. These VLA distinctions are incorporated into an integer goal program. Empirical data are used to demonstrate how VLA assumptions produce solutions that are significantly different from solutions coming from TLA assumptions. Sensitivity analysis is described, as are applications in other VLA contexts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.05.005","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['volunteer', 'labor', 'not-for-profit']","The article discusses volunteer labor in not-for-profit contexts, which touches on themes of social contribution and community service.

To demonstrate this contention, we employ an adaptation of the Goldstein et al. [Goldstein, S.M., Johnston, R., Duffy, J., Rao, J., 2002. The service concept: the missing link in service design research? Journal of Operations Management 20 (2), 121\u2013134] service planning design framework, taking issue with some interpretative aspects of their strategic model. The modified planning framework was applied to an initiative in South Carolina state government to improve operations and technology deployment at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The detailed and ongoing case study illustrates the utility of a broad service-based, IT-enabled approach to designing a government service, while simultaneously demonstrating that operational service alignment is the key to avoiding results that have long been labeled a dilemma in the public sector.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.06.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['public sector', 'service design', 'efficiency', 'technology']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and the application of technology in public sector operations, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Prior research on multistage services has analyzed each process stage independently or in an additive manner. Increased emphasis on Six Sigma initiatives in services has rekindled interest in the use of control charts to monitor and control service processes. This study examines the cause selecting control chart as a methodology to monitor and identify potential problem areas in an actual cascade service process and compares the diagnostic capability of the cause selecting chart to that of a traditional Shewhart chart. A grocery store whose parent company was implementing efficient consumer response (ECR) serves as the research context. This study models the grocery store as a two-stage cascade process and uses operating data from the store to construct a cause selecting chart and a traditional Shewhart chart for the front-end operation. Analysis of the two charts reveals that the cause selecting chart outperforms the traditional control chart as tool for signaling unusual variation in performance at the front-end stage. The analysis demonstrates that service managers can receive misleading or erroneous information from traditional control charts if the service process being monitored is a cascade process.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.04.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for performance measurement in service operations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Organizations seeking to implement these changes should have an internal environment that emphasizes knowledge assimilation and sharing and creates continuous learning capability, i.e., absorptive capacity. This study reviews the construct of absorptive capacity, develops a valid and reliable instrument to measure it, and examines its impact on the organization's ability to assimilate innovative manufacturing technology and management practice. To illustrate the links, this study tests the relationships among absorptive capacity, time-based manufacturing practices, and value to customer. Structural equation modeling, applied to a relatively large sample (n = 303), indicates strong, positive, and direct relationships between absorptive capacity and time-based manufacturing practices, and between time-based manufacturing practices and value to customer. The managerial implications of these empirical findings are also discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.05.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing practices and organizational capabilities without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Of course, technology is not a cure-all; rather, it is a tool that can be used by skilled nurse professionals in transforming sick patients into well patients with reasonable efficiency. The causal relationships between technology, nurse management decisions and performance established in this study are an important addition to the healthcare services literature.

The buying company, referred to as the focal company, manages the suppliers in the supply base through contracts and purchasing of parts, materials, and services. To facilitate better management of a supply base, we observe \u201ccomplexity\u201d as a key area of managerial consideration and apply the literature on complexity to the supply base. Supply base complexity is conceptualized in three dimensions: (1) the number of suppliers in the supply base, (2) the degree of differentiation among these suppliers, and (3) the level of inter-relationships among the suppliers. Four propositions have been formulated in terms of four major areas of research within supply chain management\u2014transaction costs, supply risk, supplier responsiveness, and supplier innovation. Corollary propositions are also stated. Although a reduction in complexity may lead to lower transaction costs and increased supplier responsiveness, in certain circumstances it may also increase supply risk and reduce supplier innovation. Therefore, reducing supply base complexity in general may be a cost-efficient approach, but blindly reducing it may potentially decrease the buying company's overall competitiveness.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.07.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on supply base management and complexity without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

It is believed that the implementation of these concepts enhances inter-firm relationships. Furthermore, as firms move towards closer and more integrated supply chains it is argued that socialization is an increasingly important mechanism in facilitating and enhancing the supply integration process. This paper has taken these activities and embedded them in the theory of \u2018socialization\u2019 and supply chain integration. The authors propose and test a model on how buyers can use the concepts of supply chain integration and socialization to achieve improved supplier communication and operational performance, and therefore, to improve the buyer's perceived level of the supplier's contractual conformance. The findings reveal that socialization is essential for the development of any significant business relationship and the enhancement of a supply integration strategy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['socialization', 'supply chain', 'integration']","The article discusses socialization and integration in supply chain management, which touches on relationship-building but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Some countries have adopted both the MBNQA criteria and weights, while others have adapted the criteria categories or weights somewhat. The relevance of this conceptual framework across national cultures has yet to be established, despite its use as the foundation for numerous national quality awards. This study uses Hofstede's dimensions of national culture to examine whether the theoretical constructs underlying the Baldrige criteria are relevant across national cultures. Correlation analysis, stepwise regression and analysis of variance are used to analyze hypotheses in manufacturing plants in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Italy and England. There were many interactions between dimensions of national culture and the Baldrige constructs advanced in this study. The findings indicate that national culture plays a strong role in the effectiveness of the Baldrige constructs, with the exception of customer and market focus. The findings are interpreted in light of the need for countries to develop awards and quality initiatives tailored to their national cultures.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.002","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['national culture', 'quality awards', \"Hofstede's dimensions\"]","The article discusses the relevance of quality constructs across different national cultures, indicating a recognition of cultural diversity.

We operationalize supplier integration as a bundle of practices that include a set of \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d practices. We hypothesize that such practices in specific configurations can be as important a source of performance differentials as the adoption of individual practices themselves. We theorize the existence of a level of integration that results in optimal performance. The paper uses data from a cross-section of more than 300 US manufacturing companies to test the notion of an optimal level of supplier integration, and examine the conditions surrounding its development. The results provide empirical support for the concept of an optimal set of supplier integration practices. We show that deviations from the optimal profile are associated with performance deterioration, and that indiscriminate and continued investments in integration may not yield commensurate improvements in performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier integration and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Data from 137 completed NPD projects are analyzed for evidence pointing to tradeoffs in performance patterns manifested in the data. In addition, we investigate hypothesized relationships between certain NPD practices and a holistic, efficiency based measure of NPD performance. We demonstrate a new approach to the operationalization of holistic new product development (NPD) project performance, employing a sequential data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology that simultaneously incorporates multiple factors including new product development cost, product cost, product quality, and project lead time.\n            \n            The results of the data analysis support our hypothesis that tradeoffs among NPD performance outcomes are manifested more strongly in highly efficient projects when compared to inefficient projects. The presence of three distinct subgroups in highly efficient projects is suggestive of several modes of efficiency which appear to achieve equally effective market success. The absence of such patterns in less efficient projects supports a theory of performance frontiers that may impose the need for tradeoffs more strongly as NPD projects achieve higher levels of efficiency. The findings also point to the importance of project management experience, balanced management commitment, and cross-functional integration in achieving high levels of NPD project efficiency. We discuss the implications of the findings for practice and for future research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of new product development efficiency and performance tradeoffs without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations."],["2006","24","5","Chong Leng Tan,\u00a0\n                     Chong Leng Tan\n                     Department of Business, University of Idaho, USASearch for more papers by this authorMark A.

In this environment, the performance of the product development process and the impact of product design on costs are critical factors for organizational success. To respond, firms are adding resources such as computer-aided design (CAD) to enhance product development efforts. The use of CAD technology is expected to enhance product development performance (development time, product quality, and design productivity) and to reduce product and manufacturing costs. To investigate these relationships, data were collected from 175 manufacturing firms regarding CAD usage, product development performance, and cost performance. From these data, valid and reliable instruments were developed to measure CAD usage. Structural model tests indicated that CAD usage has a positive impact on product development performance and cost performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.007","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and performance metrics without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It has also been shown that flexibility can be utilized proactively to create a competitive advantage for a company. Despite the recognition that it serves a dual purpose, little work has been done to synthesize these competing uses of flexibility. This study proposes a model that not only articulates an effective use of flexibility concurrently for both proactive and reactive purposes, it also allows a simultaneous view of the opportunities and uncertainties along the value-chain. By embracing the entire value-chain, this model considers the implications of the inter-relating feedback loops within the supply-chain, which to-date has been overlooked in the flexibility literature. Such an approach provides managers with a tool that allows them to consider more options in configuring flexibility between its two competing uses. Within the model, eleven dimensions of flexibility are identified and then classified into three levels comprising a transformation process. This model is grounded in observations from a field study of 10 printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication companies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.008","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['flexibility', 'value-chain', 'competitive advantage']","The article primarily focuses on operational flexibility and competitive advantage without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Building on the resource-based view, strategic choice theory, and configurational research, we suggest that the relative fit among strategy and eight knowledge elements is a key to achieving superior supply chain performance. Using data from 913 entities in supply chains, we conducted a profile deviation analysis by using ideal \u201cknowledge profiles\u201d for five strategy types as the benchmarks. Separate analyses were conducted based on the ideal profiles derived from qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical inputs. Overall, the results indicate that the strategy-knowledge fit is associated with chain performance. Our findings lend support to the notion that capitalizing on knowledge can create superior performance in supply chains, but only if the relative emphasis on various knowledge elements matches strategy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.009","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of supply chain performance and knowledge management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2006","24","5","N.C.

A review of the literature addressing such systems indicates that existing research is almost exclusively focused on higher level planning issues such as facility location and resource allocation. In contrast, this study addresses the operational level of such a system, an existing fire department's response to residential structure fire. Such a response exhibits many of the elements of traditional project management, such as distinctly defined tasks and significant predecessor relationships. However, the defining characteristic of these projects is not simply expediency, but the fact that the structure of the project can change if the preceding project structure does not complete some aspect of its task sequence within an interval of time dictated by some external pacing function. What emerges is a unique and intriguing class of project, dubbed the hyper-project in this study. The concept of the hyper-project is discussed both in its general form and with respect to the aforementioned case study example. Readily transferable to non-emergency applications, the hyper-project typifies and unites a heretofore unrecognized family of operations, highlighting the opportunities for future research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.010","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational aspects of emergency service systems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Lean manufacturing and agile manufacturing paradigms have also received considerable attention in operations management literature. However, paradoxically, the extant literature is lacking in clarity and fails to delineate with sufficient precision how and why leanness and agility differ. Given the resource constraints within which most manufacturing firms have to operate today, it is useful, if not critical, to develop a good understanding of how these paradigms differ and what their constituent dimensions are. Such an understanding is also essential for developing and testing theories relating to leanness and agility.\n            \n            Through a literature review we discuss leanness and agility in two ways: (1) as manufacturing paradigms and (2) as performance capabilities. Our empirical study attempts to determine whether lean and agile forms occur with any degree of regularity in manufacturing plants. The results confirm the existence of homogeneous groups that resemble lean and agile performing plants, and they identify important differences pertaining to their constituent performance dimensions. The results indicate that while the pursuit of agility might presume leanness, pursuit of leanness might not presume agility. While the performance capability differences across the empirically derived groups accord well with expected differences across plants that excel in leanness and agility, the practice differences across the groups are not as clearly distinguished. We discuss the implications of our findings for further research and theory development.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.011","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing paradigms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These groups vary with respect to the degrees of \u201crationality\u201d and \u201cadaptability\u201d of planning. In addition, the strategic manufacturing planning history and level of planning maturity differs between these groups, providing evidence that the planning process changes and evolves over time from \u201cnon-rational adaptive\u201d mode towards a more \u201crational adaptive\u201d approach. Firms between these polar extremes appear to take different paths in their movement toward a \u201crational adaptive\u201d mode, with some \u201cfocusing on rationality\u201d first and others \u201cfocusing on adaptability\u201d first. We also show that irrespective of the firm's environment, a greater degree of \u201crational adaptivity\u201d is correlated with better planning outcomes and business performance. As such, it represents a \u201cbest practice\u201d approach to strategic manufacturing planning. Insights created by this work not only make an important contribution to the manufacturing strategy literature, but can also be used by senior manufacturing managers to facilitate their progress towards more effective planning.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.012","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of strategic manufacturing planning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While the creation of relational capital within an organization is a relatively well identified concept in organizational research, comparatively little research exists on the inter-organizational socialization processes that create relational value in supply chains. In our research, we extend theoretical models of group social conduits into this context, and develop a model that posits the impact of formal and informal socialization processes on the creation of relational capital between buyers and suppliers. Results from our study of 111 manufacturing organizations in the United Kingdom suggest that informal socialization processes are important in the creation of relational capital, which in turn can lead to improved supplier relationship outcomes. Formal bridging socialization conduits appear to play a lesser role in deriving these benefits.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.08.007","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['social ties', 'relational capital', 'socialization processes']","The article discusses the importance of social ties and relational capital in supply chains, which hints at collaborative and inclusive practices.

To do so we posit a theoretical framework that integrates the heretofore distinct operational make\u2013buy literature and the behavioral decision-making literature. Within the framework three factors influencing the make\u2013buy decision are brought into account: the decision-maker's perception of supply risk or \u201cstrategic vulnerability\u201d, the degree of core competency represented by the product component under consideration and the formality of the information about supply alternatives. The results of a controlled experimental survey show that: strategic vulnerability and core competency do influence the make\u2013buy decision, strategic vulnerability has greater influence than core competency and information formality moderates the make\u2013buy decision when the strategic vulnerability and core competency conditions are mixed. The practical implications of these results include the notion that management can ensure a more rational make\u2013buy decision if they understand the biases that influence the decision and point these biases out to the decision maker.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['decision-making', 'supply risk', 'core competency']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of decision-making in supply management without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

There is relatively poor understanding what the implications are of increased task complexity in planning and scheduling operations. Previous work in the behavioral sciences have investigated the concept of cognitive load, addressing both task complexity and task workload or stress, and have concluded that decision makers tend to resort to routine action and reduce the variety in their actions with increasing complexity and workload. Alternatively, control theory suggests that a higher variety of actions is needed to deal with more complex problems. In this paper, we investigate the effects of task complexity in a chemical plant on the variety of actions deployed by the planners. The single work center resource structure and the availability of actual planning data from an MRP-application database allows us to both use field data and study a situation which is simple enough to measure the main effect. Our results suggest that increased task complexity without time pressure does indeed lead to increased action variety deployed by the planners.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.09.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive load and task complexity in planning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Replication is an important technique for researchers to embrace in order to achieve this goal. In this study, we test one of the frameworks of technology outsourcing developed in the West, by changing the cultural context. Following Kodak's historic outsourcing decision, technology outsourcing has assumed significant importance among researchers and practitioners. Most of the research in relation to technology outsourcing has been conducted in the Western culture (including the USA and the UK), so our goal in this study is to extend the understanding of technology outsourcing research conducted in the West to another culture-that of Korea, through replication.\n            \n            We focused on information systems (IS) outsourcing decision making as a case in point and found both similarities and dissimilarities in relation to the current understanding of the same. These similarities and differences in turn, reveal the distinctions between the Western and the Korean approaches toward achieving outsourcing success. The similarities are the partial preference for short-term contracts and contracting out to external vendors. However, the two cultures differed in their decision making in the way they pursue contractual completeness, whether in-house departments competes or not, design of contract to include partnership measures, criticality of tasks outsourced, familiarity with the outsourced task, postponing a few outsourcing decisions, and withholding a piece of a contract as bait. We also found \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201ctask partitioning to gain advantage of varied expertise\u201d to be important for achieving outsourcing success in the Korean organization. In addition, we observed that outsourcing success is achieved by maximizing reliability and relationship in the Korean context rather than by maximizing flexibility and control, as was observed in the Western context.

This model defines four internal processes that result in external moral behavior:  recognition, judgment, intention, and behavior.  We test our model with a sample of Information Systems students in Hong Kong who provided measures of self-reported behavior regarding levels of buying and using pirated software.  Using partial least squares, we investigated the causal pathways of the model and the effects of age and gender.  We find that use is determined by buying, buying is determined by intention, and intention is determined by judgment.  Although respondents recognized software piracy as an infringement of intellectual property rights, this fact did not affect their judgment of the morality of the act.  Significant differences are also found in the ethical decision-making process based on age but only limited differences based on gender.

Software agents combine and integrate capabilities of several information technology classes in a novel manner that enables supply chain management and decision making in modes not supported previously by IT and not reported previously in the information systems literature.  Indeed, federations and swarms of software agents today are moving the boundaries of computer-aided decision making more generally.  Such moving boundaries highlight promising new opportunities for competitive advantage in business, in addition to novel theoretical insights.  But they also call for shifting research thrusts in information systems.   The stream of research associated with this article is taking some first steps to address such issues by examining experimentally the capabilities, limitations, and boundaries of agent technology for computer-based decision support and automation in the procurement domain.  Procurement represents an area of particular potential for agent-based process innovation, as well as reflecting some of the greatest technological advances in terms of agents emerging from the laboratory.  Procurement is imbued with considerable ambiguity in its task environment, ambiguity that presents a fundamental limitation to IT-based automation of decision making and knowledge work.  By investigating the comparative performance of human and software agents across varying levels of ambiguity in the procurement domain, the experimentation described in this article helps to elucidate some new boundaries of computer-based decision making quite broadly.  We seek in particular to learn from this domain and to help inform computer-based decision making, agent technological design, and IS research more generally.","https://misq.umn.edu/incorporating-software-agents-into-supply-chains-experimental-investigation-with-a-procurement-task.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of software agents in supply chain management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The fundamental principles of good IT management are also applicable in many industries.  Thus, firms whose business units operate in different industries have an opportunity to exploit cross-unit IT synergies by applying their IT resources and management processes across multiple units.  This study examines sources of cross-unit IT synergy and the conditions under which cross-unit IT synergies improve the performance of multibusiness firms.  Building on the resource-based view of diversification and the economic theory of complementarities, the study identifies the relatedness and complementarity of IT resources as two major sources of cross-unit IT synergy.  It argues that IT relatedness\u2014the use of common IT infrastructure technologies and common IT management processes across business units\u2014creates sub-additive cost synergies, whereas complementarities among IT infrastructure technologies and IT management processes create super-additive value synergies.  In a sample of 356 multibusiness Fortune 1000 firms, the study finds that sub-additive cost synergies arising from the use of related IT resources or management processes do not have any effects on corporate performance, whereas the super-additive value synergies arising from the use of a complementary set of IT resources and management processes have significant effects on corporate performance.  The diversification level of the firm moderates the relationship between IT synergies and corporate performance.  As the diversification level increases, the performance effects of IT synergies remain positive, but they become weaker.  The IT governance mode of the firm (centralized, decentralized, hybrid) does not make a difference in the performance effects of IT synergies.","https://misq.umn.edu/performance-effects-in-information-technology-synergies-in-multibusiness-firms.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information technology management and performance in multibusiness firms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is a question that is regularly addressed by members of promotion and tenure committees and those called upon to write external letters.  While there are many elements to this question, one major element is the quality and quantity of an individual\u2019s research publications.  An informal survey of senior Information Systems faculty members at 49 leading U.S. and Canadian universities found 86 percent to expect three or more articles in elite journals.  In contrast, an analysis of publication performance of Ph.D. graduates between the years of 1992 and 2004 found that approximately three individuals in each graduating year of Ph.D.s (about 2 percent) published 3 or more articles in a set of 20 elite journals within 6 years of graduation.  Only 15 individuals from each graduating year (11 percent) published one or more articles.  As a discipline, we publish elite journal articles at a lower rate than Accounting, yet our promotion and tenure standards are higher, similar to those of Management, Marketing, and Finance.  Thus, there is a growing divergence between research performance and research standards within the Information Systems discipline.  As such, unless we make major changes, these differences will perpetuate a vicious cycle of increasing faculty turnover, declining influence on university affairs, and lower research productivity.

Research on explanation provision and the impact on KBS users has shown that the domain expertise affects the type of explanations selected by the user and the basis for seeking such explanations.  The prior literature has been limited, however, by the use of simulated KBS that generally provide only feedback explanations (i.e., ex post to the recommendation of the KBS being presented to the user).  The purpose of this study is to examine the way users with varying levels of expertise use alternative types of KBS explanations and the impact of that use on decision making.  A total of 64 partner/ manager-level and 82 senior/staff-level insolvency professionals participated in an experiment involving the use of a fully functioning KBS to complete a complex judgment task.  In addition to feedback explanations, the KBS also provided feedforward explanations (i.e., general explanations during user input about the relationships between information cues in the KBS) and included definition type explanations (i.e., declarative-level knowledge).  The results show that users were more likely to adhere to recommendations of the KBS when an explanation facility was available.  Choice patterns in using explanations indicated that novices used feedforward explanations more than experts did, while experts were more likely than novices to use feedback explanations.  Novices also used more declarative knowledge and initial problem solving type explanations, while experts used more procedural knowledge explanations.  Finally, use of feedback explanations led to greater adherence to the KBS recommendation by experts\u2014a condition that was even more prevalent as the use of feedback explanations increased.

We examine the relationship between information technology features, specifically information transparency features, and consumer willingness to share information for online personalization.  Based on a survey  of over 400 online consumers, we examine the question of whether customer perceived information transparency is associated with consumer willingness to be profiled online.  Our results indicate that customers who desire greater information transparency are less willing to be profiled.  This result poses a dilemma for firms, as the consumers that value information transparency features most are also the consumers who are less willing to be profiled online.  In order to manage this dilemma, we suggest that firms adopt a strategy of providing features that address the needs of consumers who are more willing to partake in personalization, therefore accepting that the privacy sensitive minority of consumers are unwilling to participate in personalization, despite additional privacy features.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-personalization-privacy-paradox-an-empirical-evaluation-of-information-transparency-and-the-willingness-to-be-profiled-online-for-personalization.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['information transparency', 'privacy', 'consumer', 'profiling']","The article discusses themes of information transparency and consumer privacy, which align with ethical considerations in Information Systems.

Prior work is predicated on the belief that higher levels of software comprehension are associated with higher levels of performance on modification tasks.  This study provides a more complete understanding of the relationship between software comprehension and modification.  We conceptualize software maintenance as interlinking comprehension and modification, and argue that the relationship between the two is moderated by cognitive fit.  Specifically, cognitive fit exists when the software maintainer\u2019s dominant mental representation of the software and their mental representation of the modification task emphasize the same type of knowledge.  We hypothesize that when cognitive fit exists, greater improvements in comprehension are associated with higher levels of performance on a modification task.  When cognitive fit does not exist, however, the software maintainer\u2019s mental representations of the software and of the modification task do not emphasize the same type of knowledge, which may mean that attention is devoted to comprehension at the expense of modification, resulting in lower performance on the modification task.  In these circumstances, comprehension and modification tasks may interfere with each other, an effect known as dual-task interference.  We therefore hypothesize that performance on a modification task is moderated by the fit between the mental representation of the software and that of the modification task.\n\nWe tested our theory by varying cognitive fit to create matched and mismatched conditions in a single experiment that used IT professionals as subjects.  Our findings support our theory:  cognitive fit moderates the relationship between comprehension and modification.  Specifically, changes in software comprehension and modification performance are positively related when cognitive fit exists and negatively related when cognitive fit does not exist.  Our findings demonstrate the need to examine more complex relationships among the numerous types of tasks involved in software development rather than examining software comprehension alone.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-role-of-cognitive-fit-in-the-relationship-between-software-comprehension-and-modification.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on cognitive fit and its impact on software comprehension and modification without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The process is captured through two online consumer behaviors:  (1) getting information and (2) purchasing a product from a Web vendor.  First, we simultaneously model the association between these two contingent online behaviors and their respective intentions by appealing to consumer behavior theories and the theory of  implementation intentions, respectively.  Second, following TPB, we derive for each behavior its intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC).  Third, we elicit and test a comprehensive set of salient beliefs for each behavior. \n\nA longitudinal study with online consumers supports the proposed e-commerce adoption model, validating the predictive power of TPB and the proposed conceptualization of PBC as a higher-order factor formed by self-efficacy and controllability. Our findings stress the importance of trust and technology adoption variables (perceived usefulness and ease of use) as salient beliefs for predicting e-commerce adoption, justifying the integration of trust and technology adoption variables within the TPB framework.  In addition, technological characteristics (download delay, Website navigability, and information protection), consumer skills, time and monetary resources, and product characteristics (product diagnosticity and product value) add to the explanatory and predictive power of our model.

KC is a process wherein an individual is affected by the experiences of another.  The outcomes of KC\u2014transferred and transformed knowledge\u2014hinge on the development of understanding.  The KC process is enabled via various communicative and noncommunicative media.  Because the KC process occurs over time, it possesses a temporal fabric or structure.  We explore the practical realities of KC as a dynamic, time- and experience-dependent process.  We consider how the  temporal fabric of KC creates an evolving reciprocal relationship among perceived media utility, selection, and use of media, as well as switching and/or combining media.  We propose and discuss two key factors as determinants of perceived media utility use in the KC process:  (1) the temporal behavior of individuals engaged in the KC process and (2) individual and joint experience-based factors.  We also discuss the role of contextual factors as antecedents.  Finally, we offer and illustrate two primary temporal structures for KC media selection and use:  (1) monophasic, wherein KC participants use a single medium at a time, and (2) polyphasic, wherein KC participants deploy multiple media simultaneously.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the design of KC-enabling systems and directions for future research.","https://misq.umn.edu/unraveling-the-temporal-fabric-of-knowledge-conversion-a-model-of-media-selection-and-use.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of knowledge conversion without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Recently the term analytical eCRM has been used to refer to the use of such methods in the online world.  A characteristic of most of the current approaches in eCRM is that they use data collected about users\u2019 activities at a single site only and, as we argue in this paper, this can present an incomplete picture of user activity.  However, it is possible to obtain a complete picture of user activity from across-site data on users.  Such data is expensive, but can be obtained by firms directly from their users or from market data vendors.  A critical question is whether such data is worth obtaining, an issue that little prior research has addressed.  In this paper, using a data mining approach, we present an empirical analysis of the modeling benefits that can be obtained by having complete information.  Our results suggest that the magnitudes of gains that can be obtained from complete data range from a few percentage points to 50 percent, depending on the problem for which it is used and the performance metrics considered.  Qualitatively we find that variables related to customer loyalty and browsing intensity are particularly important and these variables are difficult to derive from data collected at a single site.  More importantly, we find that a firm has to collect a reasonably large amount of complete data before any benefits can be reaped and caution against acquiring too little data.","https://misq.umn.edu/an-empirical-analysis-of-the-value-of-complete-information-for-ecrm-models.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data collection and analysis in eCRM without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

A research model is developed to investigate the hierarchy of IT-related capabilities and their impact on firm performance.  Data were collected from 110 supply chain and logistics managers in manufacturing and retail organizations.  Our results suggest that integrated IT infrastructures enable firms to develop the higher-order capability of supply chain process integration.  This capability enables firms to unbundle information flows from physical flows, and to share information with their supply chain partners to create information-based approaches for superior demand planning, for the staging and movement of physical products, and for streamlining voluminous and complex financial work processes.  Furthermore, IT-enabled supply chain integration capability results in significant and sustained firm performance gains, especially in operational excellence and revenue growth.

Culture also plays a role in managerial processes that may directly, or indirectly, influence IT.  Culture is a challenging variable to research, in part because of the multiple divergent definitions and measures of culture.  Notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on the relationship of IT and culture.  This paper  sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the linkages between IT and culture. We begin by conceptualizing culture and laying the groundwork for a values-based approach to the examination of IT and culture. Using this approach, we then provide a comprehensive review of the organizational and cross-cultural IT literature that conceptually links these two traditionally separate streams of research. From our analysis, we develop six themes of IT-culture research emphasizing culture\u2019s impact on IT, IT\u2019s impact on culture, and IT culture. Building upon these themes, we then develop a theory of IT, values, and conflict.  Based upon the theory, we develop propositions concerning three types of cultural conflict and the results of these conflicts.  Ultimately, the theory suggests that the reconciliation of these conflicts results in a reorientation of values.

The model is based on the idea that the tenets of the OSS ideology motivate behaviors that enhance cognitive trust and communication quality and encourage identification with the project team, which enhances affective trust.  Trust and communication in turn impact OSS team effectiveness.

Web site administrators may, therefore, deem academic data collection inappropriate.  Is there a process to make research access more open and acceptable to web site owners and administrators?  These are significant issues.  This article clarifies the problems and suggests possible approaches to handle the issues with sensitivity and openness.\n\nResearch access to commercial web sites may be manual (using a standard web browser) or automated (using automated data collection agents).  These approaches have different effects on web sites.  Researchers using manual access tend to make a limited number of page requests because manual access is costly to perform.  Researchers using automated access methods can request large numbers of pages at a low cost.  Therefore, web site administrators tend to view manual access and automated access very differently.\n\nBecause of the number of accesses and the nonbusiness purpose, automated research requests for data are sometimes blocked by site administration using a variety of means (both technological and legal).

Results of empirical studies have been mixed, with several studies showing that product prices have not decreased and others showing that prices have increased in some cases.  One explanation is that sellers prefer not to join EMPs with high price transparency, leading highly price transparent EMPs to fail.  Therefore, in order to be successful, EMPs might be expected to avoid high price transparency.  But that strategy creates a catch-22 for EMPs on the buy side:  Why would buyers want to join EMPs in the absence of price transparency and the benefit of lower prices?  We argue that successful EMPs must provide compensatory benefits for sellers in the case of high price transparency and for buyers in the case of low price transparency.\n\nTo understand how EMPs could succeed, regardless of price transparency, we examined the relationships among EMP strategy, price transparency, and performance by analyzing all 19 EMPs that compete by selling a broad range of standard electronics components.  We found that all EMPs pursuing a low cost strategy had high price transparency and performed poorly.  All EMPs that performed well pursued strategies of differentiation, but, interestingly, not all successful EMPs avoided price transparency:  Some EMPs succeeded despite enabling high price transparency.

Recent research on electronic markets has revealed that IT has increased market transparency due to increased accessibility and availability of market information.  However, what online sellers do in terms of strategic pricing decisions, in particular price adjustment behavior over time, has not been fully investigated.  Due to the ease of making price changes, electronic sellers can execute a number of different pricing strategies, including setting the frequency and amount of price changes.  We investigate the \u201copaque\u201d side of electronic markets by exploring online sellers\u2019 price adjustment patterns over time.

Interestingly, small price increases occur more frequently than decreases, while the frequency of price adjustment is significantly associated with a product\u2019s price dispersion.

The institutional contexts contrasted are professional versus political contexts.  In a survey of 214 city governments in the United States, we substantiate the existence of these two institutional contexts, a distinction that has been noted to extend into the private sector as well.\n\nSubsequent analyses of the moderating effects of institutional context on the application of the TCE heuristic to the outsourcing decision revealed the following:  The institutional context moderated the impacts of \u201chuman frailty\u201d conditions\u2014of opportunism and bounded rationality\u2014and of transaction frequency on outsourcing decisions.

This study breaks new ground by examining how firms align their software processes, products, and strategies in Internet application development.  Drawing upon the literatures in strategy, operations management, and information systems, we identify four dimensions that influence alignment:  the business unit strategy, the level of product customization, the level of process customization, and the volume of customers.  To examine how these dimensions are synchronized, we conducted detailed case studies of Internet application development in nine varied firms including both start-ups and established \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d companies.  Our analyses reveal that the firms in our study do use differing processes for Internet application development, and that many of the firms match their software process choices to product characteristics, customer volume, and business unit strategies.  We develop concept maps for the firms that are in alignment to illustrate how managers configure specific product and process dimensions.  We also offer potential explanations for why some firms are misaligned, such as attempting to execute incompatible strategies, the lack of coordination between marketing and production strategies, the too rapid expansion of process scope, and inflexible barriers to rapid adaptation of process.

This study tests empirically whether these mappings are observed in practice.  The research site is a large Irish financial services organization with well established IT risk management practices not tied to any real options framework.  Our analysis of the risk management plans developed for a broad portfolio of 50 IT investments finds ample empirical support for OBRiM\u2019s risk-option mappings.  This shows that IT managers follow the logic of option-based risk management, although purely based on intuition.  Unfortunately, reliance on this logic based on intuition alone could lead to suboptimal or counterproductive risk management practices.

This study focuses on further conceptual development of this important belief in technology acceptance.  Unlike much prior research that has focused on only a limited aspect of compatibility, we provide a more comprehensive conceptual definition that disaggregates the content of compatibility into four distinct and separable constructs:  compatibility with preferred work style, compatibility with existing work practices, compatibility with prior experience, and compatibility with values.  We suggest that the form of the multidimensional compatibility construct is best modeled as a multivariate structural model.  Based on their conceptual definitions, we develop operational measures for the four compatibility variables.  We assess the nomological validity of our conceptualization by situating it within the technology acceptance model.  In contrast to prior research, which has regarded beliefs of compatibility as an independent antecedent of technology acceptance outcomes, we posit causal linkages not only among the four compatibility beliefs, but also between compatibility beliefs and usefulness, and ease of use.  We test our theoretical model with a field sample of 278 users of a customer relationship management system in the context of a large bank.  Scale validation indicates that the operational measures of compatibility developed in this study have acceptable psychometric properties, which support the existence of four distinct constructs.

This study takes a trust-centered, cognitive and emotional balanced perspective to study RA adoption.  Grounded on the theory of reasoned action, the IT adoption literature, and the trust literature, this study theoretically articulates and empirically examines the effects of perceived personalization and familiarity on cognitive trust and emotional trust in an RA, and the impact of cognitive trust and emotional trust on the intention to adopt the RA either as a decision aid or as a delegated agent.\n\nAn experiment was conducted using two commercial RAs.

Perceived personalization significantly increases customers\u2019 intention to adopt by increasing cognitive trust and emotional trust.  Emotional trust plays an important role beyond cognitive trust in determining customers\u2019 intention to adopt.

Past literature provides many instructive but mostly unrelated answers.  Frequent findings are startup problems, penguin effects, and tendencies toward monopoly.  But substantial problems in applying the models to concrete standardization problems reveal that the dynamics are probably more complex.  Not all networks are ultimately conquered by a single standard once it has attracted a certain number of users.  And not all diffusion results are either complete or no standardization.\n\nWe address the question of the conditions of particular diffusion behaviors by developing a formal standardization model that captures all fragmented phenomena in a unified approach.  Drawing from findings of other research, we incorporate the structure of the underlying user network as an important determinant for diffusion behaviors.  The approach allows us to disclose varying conditions that generate frequently observed standardization behaviors as special parameter constellations of the model.  Using equilibrium analysis and computer simulations we identify a standardization gap that reveals the magnitude of available standardization gains for individuals and the network as a whole.  The analysis shows that network topology and density have a strong impact on standard diffusion and that the renowned tendency toward monopoly is far less common.  We also report how the model can be used to solve corporate standardization problems.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-unified-economic-model-of-standard-diffusion-the-impact-of-standardization-cost-network-effects-and-network-topology.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of standard diffusion and network effects without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Through an intensive case analysis of VIS standardization in the U.S. residential mortgage industry, VIS standardization success is shown to be as problematic as IT product standardization success, but for different reasons.\n\nVIS standardization involves two linked collective action dilemmas\u2014standards development and standards diffusion\u2014 with different characteristics, such that a solution to the first may fail to resolve the second. Whereas prior theoretical and empirical research shows that IT product standardization efforts tend to splinter into rival factions that compete through standards wars in the marketplace, successful VIS standards consortia must encompass heterogeneous groups of user organizations and IT vendors without fragmenting. Some tactics successfully used to solve the collective action dilemma of VIS standardization (e.g., governance mechanisms and policies about intellectual property protection) are also used by IT product standardization efforts, but some are different, and successful VIS standardization requires a package of solutions tailored to fit and jointly resolve the specific dilemmas of particular VIS standards initiatives.","https://misq.umn.edu/industry-wide-information-systems-standardization-as-collective-action-the-case-of-the-u-s-residential-mortgage-industry.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['collective action', 'heterogeneous groups', 'standards']","The article discusses collective action and the involvement of heterogeneous groups, which hints at a recognition of diversity in stakeholder engagement.

To better understand the process of standards diffusion, we investigate firms\u2019 migration from proprietary or less-open IOS (i.e., electronic data interchange or EDI) to open-standard IOS (i.e., the Internet).  Theoretical work in economics suggests that network effects are a determinant of network adoption, yet the extant literature falls short of empirical testing of the theory. We develop a conceptual model that features network effects, expected benefits, and adoption costs as prominent antecedents.  We examine the model on a large dataset of 1,394 firms.  The empirical results demonstrate the significant impacts of network effects on open-standard IOS adoption. We find that adoption costs are a significant barrier to open-standard IOS adoption, but EDI users and nonusers treat this very differently:  EDI users are much more sensitive to the costs of switching to the new standard.  This finding illustrates that experience with older standards may create switching costs and make it difficult to shift to open and potentially better standards, a phenomenon called \u201cexcess inertia\u201d in technology change.  Further testing the underlying factors that contribute to network effects and adoption costs, we find that trading community influence is a key driver of network effects, while managerial complexity, as opposed to financial costs, is a key determinant of adoption costs.

We develop a model of a decision maker who sequentially learns about the true product profitability from observed product sales. Based on the current information, the decision maker decides whether to scrap the product. Central to this decision problem are sequential information gathering, and the option value of scrapping the product at any point in time. The model predicts the optimal demand for information (e.g., in the form of test marketing), and it predicts how the launch or exit policy depends on the firm\u2019s demand uncertainty. Furthermore, it predicts what fraction of newly developed products should be launched on average, and what fraction of these products will \u201cfail,\u201d i.e., exit. The model is solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. We present an application of the model to the case of the U.S. ready-to-eat breakfast cereal industry.

This result is shown in the context of durable goods manufacturing. The quandary of durable goods production is that once demand for a certain time frame is met, there is a subsequent temptation to flood the market with additional goods. As such, consumers are reluctant to buy immediately, instead opting to wait for discounted prices. This problem can be alleviated by a degree of channel discord: High wholesale prices ensure future sales will slow to a trickle.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0143","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product distribution and market dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This paper provides an empirical study on the impact of shipping and handling charges on consumer-purchasing behavior. Using a database from an online retailer that has experimented with a wide variety of shipping-fee schedules, we investigate the impact of shipping charges on order incidence and order size. We use an ordered probability model that is generalized to account for the effects of nonlinear and discontinuous shipping fees on purchasing decisions, and to accommodate heterogeneity in response parameters. Results show that consumers are very sensitive to shipping charges and that shipping fees influence order incidence and basket size. Promotions such as free shipping and free shipping for orders that exceed some size threshold are found to be very effective in generating additional sales. However, the lost revenues from shipping and the lack of response by several segments are substantial enough to render such promotions unprofitable to the retailer. Heterogeneity across consumers also suggests interesting opportunities for the retailer to customize the shipping and other marketing-mix promotion offerings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0150","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of shipping fees and consumer purchasing behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a multicategory brand-choice model with a factor-analytic structure on the covariance matrix of the coefficients. The methodology allows us to elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands, while controlling for other causes such as price sensitivity. The model is applied to a set of ten food and nonfood product categories. We find strong evidence of correlations in household preferences for store brands across categories. Using a two-dimensional factor structure, we find that one of the factors explains a substantial amount of variation in store-brand preference, while the other factor explains price sensitivity\u2014consistently across categories. The presence of these factors in all categories indicates that there are unobservable household-level traits that are non-category specific, i.e., stable across product categories.

Consumers become more rational as we are better able to predict their behavior or other important outcomes influenced by their behavior.

However, some experimental consumer behavior articles find the opposite. The difference between experimental and statistical controls explains the divergence in conclusions. Experimental controls test rationality based on whether previously absent variables exhibit significant explanatory power holding known explanatory variables constant. Statistical controls test rationality based on the incremental explanatory power of previously absent variables after accounting for known explanatory variables.

We offer and provide empirical support for a new theory of asymmetric pricing in wholesale prices. Wholesale prices may adjust asymmetrically in the small but symmetrically in the large, when retailers face cost of price adjustment. Such retailers will not adjust prices for small changes in their costs. Manufacturers then see a region of inelastic demand where small wholesale price changes do not translate into commensurate retail price changes. The implication is asymmetric\u2014a small wholesale price increase is more profitable because manufacturers will not lose customers from higher retail prices; yet, a small decrease is less profitable, because it will not lower retail prices; hence, there is no extra revenue from greater sales. For larger changes, this asymmetry in the behavior of wholesale price vanishes as the price adjustment cost is compensated by the increase in retailers\u2019 revenue resulting from correspondingly large retail price changes. We present a formal economic model of a channel with forward-looking retailers and cost of price adjustment, test the derived propositions on the behavior of manufacturer prices using a large supermarket scanner data set, and find that the results are consistent with the predictions of our theory. We then discuss the implications for asymmetric pricing, channels, and cost of price adjustment literatures, as well as public policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0138","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By answering this we can also answer the question, do results of extant research on single-product marketing that using such information intensifies competition and lowers profits, generalize to multiproduct marketing by supermarkets that carry several products, and whose patrons purchase multiple items? We derive equilibrium data-based intelligent pricing strategies that also produce increased supermarket profits. What is more interesting is our result that data analysis is profitable whether or not a competitor undertakes data analysis. If not too costly, implementing data analysis is a dominant strategy. Moreover, with comprehensive data analysis connecting basket information and household data, stores can increase profits further by targeting rewards at individual households, thereby segmenting the market more completely.

This paper analyzes the effects of consumption flexibility on competing firms\u2019 marketing mix decisions, in a model in which future preference uncertainty exists and consumers differ in their preferred product location on a horizontal attribute. The analysis shows that the nature of price competition in such markets is dependent upon whether consumer multiple buying (and thus primary demand) is endogenously induced. When preference uncertainty is important, the firms are involved in a \u201cflexibility trap\u201d in which primary demand is expanded but profits decrease with the spread of consumer heterogeneity. This counter-intuitive result is caused by the firms being induced to over-cut prices to increase primary demand when consumption flexibility is important. In response to this, the firms may configure their products to alleviate the adverse effect of consumer heterogeneity. For example, if preference uncertainty is important, the firms may choose to minimize differentiation on the horizontal attribute, or extend the current product line, to deal with the \u201cflexibility trap.\u201d The implications of allowing for positive salvage value, uncertainty heterogeneity, preference correlation, and state-dependent preference configuration are also investigated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0169","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing competition and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

More importantly, the traditional case method of teaching often ignores important research findings. Consequently, it helps destroy the link between academic research and classroom learning. Students lose the benefit of important research findings while leaving the classroom with false confidence about what they know. Researchers lose an incentive to do research relevant to their students. Eventually, there is less research worth teaching, and fewer students value the knowledge learned through painstaking research.

It integrates research on customer satisfaction and social influence to develop hypotheses about how an individual\u2019s satisfaction is influenced by discrepancies between her expectations about the satisfaction of other group members and their actual opinions as revealed in group discussion. It also considers how this effect is moderated by the individual\u2019s susceptibility to social influence and perceptions of group cohesiveness. Two empirical studies demonstrate significant social influence effects on satisfaction judgments in groups. Study One analyzes group satisfaction data collected over time using a mixed-effects regression. It shows that an individual\u2019s perceived discrepancy between others\u2019 satisfaction judgments and expected group satisfaction has an important influence on her postdiscussion satisfaction judgments. Moreover, individuals discount the prediscussion satisfaction judgments of other group members in favor of perceived satisfaction and its discrepancy with expectations. Group cohesiveness accentuates the perceived discrepancy with expected group satisfaction. Study Two analyzes survey data from dyads drawn from a cross-sectional sample of organizational buyers who purchase from the same supplier. It models the decision maker\u2019s satisfaction with a service supplier as a function of end-user satisfaction. It shows that social influence effects exist in purchasing groups within organizations. Both studies demonstrate that individual-level postdiscussion satisfaction judgments tend to become more extreme, a phenomenon we call satisfaction escalation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0182","","MKS","Marketing","3","['satisfaction', 'social influence', 'group cohesiveness']","The article primarily focuses on customer satisfaction and social dynamics within groups, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Preference interdependence among family members is likely to be significant because of cohabitation and strong emotional ties. To estimate the preference interdependence, we specify a simultaneous equation model and propose a Bayesian estimation approach. Unlike existing models that use a spatial autoregressive structure to capture the interdependence of consumer preferences, we are able to estimate the potential asymmetry in the preference interdependence among family members in a more flexible way. In a simulation study, we show that models that ignore interdependence of preferences yield biased estimates of consumers\u2019 sensitivity to observed attribute preferences. In an empirical application, we estimate the interdependence of the viewership of television programs between husbands and wives in 481 households. We find that wives\u2019 viewing behavior depends more strongly on their husbands\u2019 viewing behavior than husbands\u2019 viewing behavior depends on their wives\u2019 viewing behavior. There exist significant differences in parameter estimates of dependence across categories of television programs.

This paper describes how firms in the current industry structure choose their agents. A theoretical section specifies the firm's decision process in obtaining the creative and media components. Conditions under which one or both could be effectively produced internally are identified. In the prevalent case when these components are outsourced, we evaluate whether they can be more efficiently produced by a bundled full-service agency or by unbundling to separate agents. An empirical section tests the theory implications with cross-sectional data on U.S. firm choices of advertising agents. The bundled full-service agency is still widely used. Firms with large advertising budgets unbundle to take advantage of media discounts obtained by market-making media shops. Internal agencies are used when firms have internal creative abilities, or have low-level requirements in both creative and media.

Using a unique frequent-shopper database that records transactions for over 10,000 customers, we study the impact of Wal-Mart\u2019s entry on consumer purchase behavior. We develop a joint model of interpurchase time and basket size to study the impact of competitor entry on two key household decisions: store visits and in-store expenditures. The model also allows for consumer heterogeneity due to observed and unobserved factors. Results show that the incumbent supermarket lost 17% volume\u2014amounting to a quarter million dollars in monthly revenue\u2014following Wal-Mart\u2019s entry. Decomposing the lost sales into components attributed to store visits and in-store expenditures, we find that the majority of these losses were due to fewer store visits with a much smaller impact attributed to basket size. We also find that Wal-Mart lures some of the incumbent\u2019s best customers, and that retention of a small number of households can significantly reduce losses at the focal store. Finally, certain observed household characteristics such as distance to store, shopping behavior, and product purchase behavior are found to be useful in profiling the defectors to Wal-Mart.

To account for the potential correlation in the preferences of models offered by a particular brand, we use a nested logit model with the brand (e.g., Sony) at the upper level and its various models (e.g., Mavica, FD, DSC, etc.) at the lower level of the nest. Relative model preferences are captured via their attributes and prices. We allow for heterogeneity across consumers in their preferences for these attributes and in their price sensitivities in addition to heterogeneity in consumers\u2019 intrinsic brand preferences. Together with the nested logit assumption, this allows for a flexible substitution pattern across models at the aggregate level. The attractiveness of a brand\u2019s product line changes over time with entry and exit of new models and with changes in attribute and price levels. To allow for time-varying intrinsic brand preferences, we use a state-space model based on the Kalman filter, which captures the influence of marketing actions such as brand-level advertising on the dynamics of intrinsic brand preferences. Hence, the proposed model accounts for the effects of brand preferences, model attributes and marketing mix variables on consumer choice. First, we carry out a simulation study to ensure that our estimation procedure is able to recover the true parameters generating the data. Then, we estimate our model parameters on data for the U.S. digital camera market. Overall, we find that the effect of dynamics in the intrinsic brand preference is greater than the corresponding effect of the dynamics in the brand\u2019s product line attractiveness. Assuming plausible profit margins, we evaluate the effect of increasing the advertising expenditures for the largest and the smallest brands in this category and find that these brands can increase their profitability by increasing their advertising expenditures. We also analyze the impact of modifying a camera model\u2019s attributes on its profits. Such an analysis could potentially be used to evaluate if product development efforts would be profitable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0188","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing and consumer preferences without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Surprisingly, we find that when firms offer customized products they are able to not only expand demand, but can also increase the prices of their standard products relative to when they do not. Second, we find that when a firm offers customized products it is a dominant strategy for it to also offer its standard product. This result highlights the role of standard products and the importance of retaining them when firms offer customized products. Third, we identify market conditions under which ex ante symmetric firms will adopt symmetric or asymmetric customization strategies.

In this study, we develop and test a conceptual model that links customer-specific relationship marketing investments to short-term, customer-specific financial outcomes. Data from a matched set of 313 business customers covered by 143 salespeople of 34 selling firms indicate that investments in social relationship marketing pay off handsomely, financial relationship marketing investments do not, and structural relationship marketing investments are economically viable for customers serviced frequently. We conceptualize relationship marketing in a context involving nested participants (customers, salespeople, selling firms) and employ a hierarchical linear modeling approach to account for observations that are not independent. Across the three hierarchical levels, the impact of the financial, social, and structural components of relationship marketing investments and the potential moderating factors offer valuable insights into contextual factors and managerial strategies for leveraging relationship marketing investments. In an attempt to suggest normative guidelines to managers, we extend our analysis to a simple resource allocation model that describes the optimal mix of relationship marketing resources based on firm strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0209","","MKS","Marketing","2","['relationship marketing', 'financial outcomes', 'social relationship']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of relationship marketing without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Behavioral and economic models of choice processes are difficult to estimate when using stated and revealed preferences because the underlying process is latent. This paper introduces Bayesian methods for estimating two behavioral models that eliminate alternatives using specific attribute levels. The elimination by aspects theory postulates a sequential elimination of alternatives by attribute levels until a single one, the chosen alternative, remains. In the economic screening rule model, respondents screen out alternatives with certain attribute levels and then choose from the remaining alternatives, using a compensatory function of all the attributes. The economic screening rule model gives an economic justification as to why certain attributes are used to screen alternatives. A commercial conjoint study is used to illustrate the methods and assess their performance. In this data set, the economic screening rule model outperforms the EBA and other standard choice models and provides comparable results to an equivalent conjunctive screening rule model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0211","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer choice modeling without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article summarizes existing work in this area and identifies promising topics for future research. Models of service and relationships can help managers manage service more efficiently, customize service more effectively, manage customer satisfaction and relationships, and model the financial impact of those customer relationships. Models for managing service have often emphasized analytical approaches to pricing, but emerging issues such as the trade-off between privacy and customization are attracting increasing attention. The trade-offs between productivity and customization have also been addressed by both analytical and empirical models, but future research in the area of service customization will likely place increased emphasis on e-service and truly personalized interactions. Relationship models will focus less on models of customer expectations and length of relationship, and more on modeling the effects of dynamic marketing interventions with individual customers. The nature of service relationships increasingly leads to financial impact being assessed within customer and across product, rather than the traditional reverse, suggesting the increasing importance of analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) and managing the firm\u2019s customer equity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0139","","MKS","Marketing","3","['privacy', 'customization', 'customer satisfaction']","The article discusses the trade-off between privacy and customization, which hints at ethical considerations in marketing practices.

Two notable areas are multiattribute utility models (LINMAP) and production frontiers (data envelopment analysis (DEA)). Both LINMAP and DEA have theoretical and managerial advantages. For example, LINMAP treats ordinal-scaled preference data as such in uncovering individual-level attribute weights, while regression treats these preferences as interval scaled. DEA produces easy-to-understand efficiency measures, which allow for improved productivity benchmarking. However, acceptance of these techniques is hindered by the lack of statistical significance tests for their parameter estimates. In this paper, we propose and evaluate such parameter significance tests. Two types of tests are forwarded. The first examines whether a model\u2019s fit is significantly reduced when an explanatory variable is deleted. The second is based on generating a standard deviation or distribution for the parameter estimate using nonparametric jackknife or bootstrap techniques. We demonstrate through simulations that both types of tests reliably identify both significant and insignificant parameters. The availability of these tests, especially the relatively simple and easy-to-use tests of the first type, should enhance the utilization of linear programming\u2013based estimation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0444","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of linear programming and statistical significance without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

These conflicting predictions primarily hinge on whether decision makers perceive negative performance as a repairable gap or as a threat to firm survival. This study examines a boundary condition of these conflicting predictions. We argue that a firm\u2019s resource endowment affects decision makers\u2019 risk tolerance: Managers in firms with large stocks of resources are buffered from the threat of failure and conform to the prediction of greater risk taking in response to performance decreases; managers in firms with limited resources view low performance as a step closer to failure and decrease risk taking in response to performance decreases. Using data on the risky decision of factory expansion in shipbuilding firms and firm size as an indicator of the stock of tangible resources, we find that performance below the aspiration level reduces risk taking in small firms, but either does not affect risk taking or increases risk taking in large firms. These findings are largely consistent with our predictions and also suggest that large firms are more inert than small firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0446","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral theories related to firm performance and risk-taking without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we focus on the interaction between a manufacturer\u2019s reverse channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e.g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e.g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility that can be used to price discriminate between retailers of different profitability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0454","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['environmental', 'economic', 'remanufacturing']","The article discusses the environmental benefits of product remanufacturing, indicating some awareness of sustainability issues, but it primarily focuses on economic trade-offs and strategic behavior in a competitive market.

We hypothesized that people often hold incorrect beliefs about averaging, falsely concluding that the average of two judges\u2019 estimates would be no more accurate than the average judge. The experiments confirmed that this misconception was common across a range of tasks that involved reasoning from summary data (Experiment 1), from specific instances (Experiment 2), and conceptually (Experiment 3). However, this misconception decreased as observed or assumed bracketing rate increased (all three studies) and when bracketing was made more transparent (Experiment 2). Experiment 4 showed that flawed inferential rules and poor extensional reasoning abilities contributed to the misconception. We conclude by describing how people may face few opportunities to learn the benefits of averaging and how misappreciating averaging contributes to poor intuitive strategies for combining estimates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0459","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of averaging opinions and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Next, we focus our attention on the duopoly environment where an independent operator (IO) may intercept cores of products made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to sell remanufactured products in future periods. We characterize the production quantities associated with self-selection and explore the effect of various parameters in the Nash equilibrium. Among other results, we find that if remanufacturing is very profitable, the original-equipment manufacturer may forgo some of the first-period margin by lowering the price and selling additional units to increase the number of cores available for remanufacturing in future periods. Further, as the threat of competition increases, the OEM is more likely to completely utilize all available cores, offering the remanufactured products at a lower price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0465","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['remanufacturing', 'competition', 'profitability']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of remanufacturing and profitability without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The right to retain the number lowers the switching cost for a consumer. Thus, the purpose of the policy is to induce more competition and facilitate the growth of new or small service providers. In this paper, we show that WNP drives market price downward as expected but with a surprising twist\u2014rather than helping the smaller firms grow, the policy may accelerate the process of market concentration. We find that the main contributing factor to this peculiarity is the discriminatory pricing scheme prevalent in the industry\u2014that is, a service provider charges a lower per-minute fee for the calls initiated and received within the same network than for the calls connected across two networks. Under this pricing scheme, a consumer who subscribes to a larger network would benefit more than if subscribing to a smaller network, despite the relatively higher fixed access fee that the former may charge. By lowering the barrier of switching, WNP creates a market condition conducive for a larger network to gain market share. We support our analysis with the empirical evidence gathered from Hong Kong where WNP was adopted in March 1999.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0466","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['consumer', 'competition', 'discriminatory pricing']","The article primarily focuses on market dynamics and pricing strategies without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Both are explained in terms of nonlinear utility for money rather than properties of events per se, hence, the decision maker displays the same attitude toward all sources of risk and uncertainty. There is ample evidence that real decision makers do not always behave (or even wish to behave) in this way, and instead they often distinguish between risk and uncertainty, as in Ellsberg\u2019s (1961) paradox. This paper presents a simple axiomatic model of nonneutral attitudes toward uncertainty and a behavioral test for uncertainty aversion that is applicable even if utility is state dependent. The decision maker may display different degrees of aversion toward gambles on different kinds of events, e.g., being systematically more averse toward gambles on events whose probabilities are more ambiguous. For such a decision maker, the elicitation of preferences among objective gambles may not yield the correct measure of risk aversion for modeling real-world decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0469","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making under uncertainty and risk without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

To cope with these challenges, manufacturers often enter into contracts with their customers that offer greater certainty of supply in return for more predictable orders. In this paper, we study a \u201cforecast-commitment\u201d contract in which the customer provides a forecast, the supplier makes a production commitment to the customer based on the forecast, and the customer\u2019s minimum order quantity is a function of the forecast and committed quantities.

We first show that the supplier has two dominant commitment strategies: committing to the forecast or committing to the production quantity. We then characterize the jointly optimal commitment and production strategy for the supplier and extend the results to consider a capacity constraint. We show that the proposed contract can moderate the supplier\u2019s motivation to underproduce, and due to the structure of the contract and the form of the supplier\u2019s optimal strategy, also limits the customer\u2019s incentive to overforecast.

Drawing upon theories on the process and contexts of technology diffusion, we develop an integrative model to examine three assimilation stages: initiation \u2192 adoption \u2192 routinization. The model features technological, organizational, and environmental contexts as prominent antecedents of this three-stage assimilation process. Based on this model, we hypothesize how technology readiness, technology integration, firm size, global scope, managerial obstacles, competition intensity, and regulatory environment influence e-business assimilation at the firm level. A unique data set of 1,857 firms from 10 countries is used to test the conceptual model and hypotheses. To probe deeper into the influence of the environmental context, we compare two subsamples from developed and developing countries. Our empirical analysis leads to several key findings: (1) Competition positively affects initiation and adoption, but negatively impacts routinization, suggesting that too much competition is not necessarily good for technology assimilation because it drives firms to chase the latest technologies without learning how to use existing ones effectively. (2) Large firms tend to enjoy resource advantages at the initiation stage, but have to overcome structural inertia in later stages. (3) We also find that economic environments shape innovation assimilation: Regulatory environment plays a more important role in developing countries than in developed countries. Moreover, while technology readiness is the strongest factor facilitating assimilation in developing countries, technology integration turns out to be the strongest in developed countries, implying that as e-business evolves, the key determinant of its assimilation shifts from accumulation to integration of technologies. Together, these findings offer insights into how innovation assimilation is influenced by contextual factors, and how the effects may vary across different stages and in different environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0487","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['innovation', 'developing countries', 'regulatory environment']","The article discusses the influence of the regulatory environment on technology assimilation in developing countries, indicating a moderate awareness of socio-economic disparities.

In the appraisal regime, the buyer inspects the units supplied and either charges a penalty for defective units identified during inspection or pays the unit price for good units. In the certification regime, the supplier obtains vendor certification and the buyer pays the unit price for all units supplied. The inspection technology and the certification process provide noisy information on the supplier's quality effort. In the appraisal regime, the buyer implements the supplier's high-quality and low-inspection. The supplier's expected profit is greater than his reservation profit because of an additional agency cost: The buyer has to prevent the supplier from performing unwanted/preemptive inspection (which gives rise to indirect costs from delay, etc.). This additional agency cost arises precisely when the effectiveness of inspection is high. This provides a moral-hazard-based rationale for the increasing use of certification (such as ISO 9000) in spite of (in fact, because of) the increasing effectiveness of inspection. The potential for additional agency cost incurred by the buyer in the appraisal regime highlights an indirect cost associated with inspection.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0557","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier quality and certification without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Retailers face a stochastic demand and must order their initial inventory before this demand is realized. After demand realization, retailers decide how much of their unsold inventory or unsatisfied demand they want to share with other retailers. This is followed by a transshipment of leftover inventories and distribution of the additional profit generated through inventory sharing. The author addresses the following issue: Suppose that the retailers distribute the profit from inventory sharing according to an allocation rule that induces retailers to share their residuals in a way that maximizes the additional profit, such as the Shapley value, but may not belong to the core. Is it likely that, in this framework, all retailers will jointly share their residuals and not form subcoalitions? Previous research has looked at this problem from a myopic viewpoint and concluded that the grand coalition is not stable. Unlike the prior work, the author looks at stability in a farsighted sense. That is, retailers do not consider only their immediate payoffs but are also concerned with reactions of other retailers to their actions. In a symmetric setting, with identical additional unit revenues from transshipments generated by all retailers, farsighted retailers always maximize their allocations by not defecting from the grand coalition. The author also provides conditions when the same is true for nonidentical additional unit revenues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0558","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of inventory distribution among retailers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This exposure is in turn determined by the number of banks aiming to focus on lending to an industry. In equilibrium, the industry receives funding from a limited number of banks with industry expertise, as well as from a competitive fringe of financiers without such expertise.

When the release of such data is sensitive, organizations need information-disclosure policies that protect data confidentiality while still providing data access. In contrast to extant disclosure policies, we describe a new policy for count tables that is based on disclosing only the sufficient statistics of a flexible discrete distribution. This distribution, the COM-Poisson, well approximates Poisson counts but also under- and over-dispersed counts. The sufficient statistics mask the exact cell counts and often also the table size. Under the scenario of a data holding agency and a data snooper, we show that this policy has low disclosure risk with no loss of data utility: Usually, many count tables correspond to the disclosed sufficient statistics. Furthermore, these count tables are equally likely to be the undisclosed table. Finding these solutions requires solving a system of linear equations, which are underdetermined for tables with more than three cells, and can be computationally prohibitive for even small tables. We also consider cell-specific interval bounds, a commonly used disclosure limitation policy, and compare them to our policy. We describe several types of snooper knowledge, their integration with the disclosed statistics, and implications. Applying this policy to three real data sets, we illustrate the low associated disclosure risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0562","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data disclosure policies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

For this, we provide a framework derived from household utility maximizing behavior which assumes that a household chooses the \u201cbundle\u201d of products with the highest utility. We use a second-order Taylor series approximation to an arbitrary utility function to represent bundle utility. Aggregate sales or shares in each category are derived under the assumption that households are heterogeneous in their preferences and in their sensitivities to marketing activities. Our estimation accounts for potential price endogeneity in demand. Using store-level scanner data on four product categories\u2014liquid laundry detergents, powdered laundry detergents, liquid fabric softeners, and sheet fabric softeners\u2014we find evidence for a complementary relationship between liquid softeners and both forms of detergents. We also find that the magnitude of cross-category elasticities are brand specific, i.e., different brands in a category have a different price impact on the demand for a brand in another category. The results have implications for retailers in terms of the potential need for cross-category management, as well as for manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble that participate in all four categories. We compare our model with a log-log regression specification on three criteria\u2014estimated elasticities, hold-out sample predictions, and retailer cross-category pricing. We find that the proposed model produces more reasonable estimates relative to the log-log model; it predicts better and is more useful for pricing purposes. Further, in a simulation study, we show that our proposed model can recover the elasticities from a data-generating process that simulates household-level joint outcomes across categories even after these data have been aggregated to brand-level shares within each category. By contrast, the log-log regression model is unable to do so.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0563","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We confine ourselves to two-echelon supply chains with a single supplier servicing a network of retailers who compete with each other by selecting sales quantities. We identify a key sufficient condition, in terms of interdependencies between chain members' operational decisions, under which perfect coordination via simple schemes is feasible, under general cost and demand functions. This condition, which we refer to as echelon operational autonomy (EOA), states that the costs incurred by the supplier for a given vector of sales volumes depends only on operational decisions she controls herself. At the same time, the costs incurred by the retailers may depend on operational decisions controlled by the supplier, in which case, the supplier's operational decisions are made to minimize chainwide costs. We show how vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships create EOA and compare the resulting coordinating pricing schemes with those required in a traditional decentralized setting (without EOA). We also discuss compliance issues with the coordinating schemes in view of the Robinson-Patman act and provide remedies to overcome these issues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0564","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['compliance', 'coordination', 'supply chains']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and pricing schemes, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Firms whose products are being discussed in such forums are therefore tempted to manipulate consumer perceptions by posting costly anonymous messages that praise their products. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm\u2019s manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of that firm\u2019s true quality, strategic manipulation of online forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a firm\u2019s true quality exist in settings where the firm\u2019s net payoff function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular (submodular) in the firm\u2019s quality and manipulation action. Third, in a broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a \u201crat race\u201d and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if they don\u2019t, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing \u201cfiltering\u201d technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate. Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from the development of such technologies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0567","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['manipulation', 'consumer perceptions', 'social cost']","The article discusses the implications of firms manipulating online opinion forums, which touches on ethical considerations regarding consumer perceptions and social costs.

Repeated interaction also facilitates the use of informal agreements (relational contracts) that are sustained not by the court system, but by the ongoing value of the relationship. We characterize the optimal relational contract in this dynamic system with double moral hazard. We show that an optimal relational contract has a simple form that does not depend on the past history. The optimal relational contract may require that the firms terminate their relationship with positive probability following poor performance. We show how process visibility, which allows the firms to better assess who is at fault, can substantially improve system performance. The degree to which process visibility eliminates the need for termination depends on the nature of the dynamics: If the buyer's action does not influence the dynamics, the need for termination is eliminated; otherwise, termination may be required.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0569","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of partnership dynamics and relational contracts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The optimal solution can be such that some customers prefer not to buy any product in the assortment, and such that the most popular product is not offered. We then obtain bounds on profit when customers dynamically substitute, using the static substitution for the lower bound, and a retailer-controlled substitution for the upper bound. We thus define two heuristics to solve the problem under dynamic substitution and numerically evaluate their performance. This analysis shows the value of modeling dynamic substitution and identifies conditions in which the static substitution solution serves as a good approximation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0580","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of assortment planning and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper develops a mechanism design model to investigate the effect of such information asymmetry on the kidney allocation system. In this model, there are n transplant queues corresponding to n candidate types. Candidate types are only observed by the candidates, and each candidate chooses the queue to join by reporting a type. Kidneys have heterogeneous types, and each kidney will be assigned to one of the queues depending on its type. Candidates report their type strategically to join the queue that maximizes their utility. Candidate utility depends on the type of kidney received and the expected waiting time, which is calculated using fluid approximations. We consider two alternative social welfare functions: aggregate utility (emphasizing efficiency) and minimum utility across all candidates (emphasizing equity). The kidney allocation problem is to divide the organ supply among the different queues so that social welfare is maximized, and this problem is solved explicitly under both objective functions. There are three findings: (1) The allocation mechanism induces truth telling by ensuring that candidates who wait longer receive better kidneys; (2) Information rents are earned by high-risk candidates under the efficiency objective and by low-risk candidates under the equity objective; (3) a choice-based kidney allocation system in which candidates choose the type of queue to join leads to outcomes in the middle of the efficiency-equity spectrum.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0541","","MS","Multidisciplinary","6","['equity', 'social welfare', 'utility', 'allocation', 'transplantation']","The article discusses the trade-off between efficiency and equity in kidney transplantation, highlighting social welfare and equity as critical themes.

The technology employed by these OEMs determines the performance quality of the end product they manufacture, which in turn forms the basis of competition among them. Within this context of downstream competition, we examine the technology provider\u2019s introduction strategies when improving technologies are introduced sequentially. We develop a two-period game-theoretic framework to account for the strategic considerations of the parties involved (i.e., the technology provider and the OEMs). Our main result indicates that the technology provider may find it beneficial to induce partial adoption of the new technology, depending on the technological progress the provider intends to offer in the future. We analyze many technology-specific and market-related characteristics\u2014such as volume-based pricing for new component technologies, upgrade prices, and OEMs with differing capabilities\u2014that correspond to various business settings.

For proprietary software or freeware, we compare four alternative policies to manage network security: (i) consumer self-patching (where no external incentives are provided for patching or purchasing); (ii) mandatory patching; (iii) patching rebate; and (iv) usage tax. We show that for proprietary software, when the software security risk and the patching costs are high, for both a welfare-maximizing social planner and a profit-maximizing vendor, a patching rebate dominates the other policies. However, when the patching cost or the security risk is low, self-patching is best. We also show that when a rebate is effective, the profit-maximizing rebate is decreasing in the security risk and increasing in patching costs. The welfare-maximizing rebates are also increasing in patching costs, but can be increasing in the effective security risk when patching costs are high. For freeware, a usage tax is the most effective policy except when both patching costs, and security risk are low, in which case a patching rebate prevails. Optimal patching rebates and taxes tend to increase with increased security risk and patching costs, but can decrease in the security risk for high-risk levels. Our results suggest that both the value generated from software and vendor profits can be significantly improved by mechanisms that target user incentives to maintain software security.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0568","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['security', 'incentives', 'welfare-maximizing']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of software security and user incentives without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

A major obstacle is the perception that the owner can unfairly exploit trading information for competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a marketplace design that shifts the locus of control over trader privacy from the marketplace operator to each individual trader. We show how online transactions between trading partners can be conducted in total privacy, so that not even the marketplace owner/operator can exploit transaction information for strategic purposes. At the same time, our approach includes robust methods for transaction integrity and nonrepudiation, as well as posttransaction dispute resolution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0570","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['privacy', 'control', 'exploit']","The article discusses privacy and control over trading information, which touches on ethical considerations in business practices.

The power law also does better than an alternative model\u2014namely, the exponential form\u2014which has previously been studied in the literature but without having been compared to any alternative. These two models have sharply different implications; for example, the power law predicts that the ratio of market shares for two successively ranked brands becomes smaller as one progresses from higher-ranked to lower-ranked brands, whereas the exponential form predicts that this ratio is a constant.

This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit\u2019s financial performance in more competitive environments.

Yet several recent reviews have recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand. In this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both other items in the current order as well as future orders. We show how the findings can be used to provide input to inventory planning models and illustrate how failing to account for the long-run effects of a stockout will lead to suboptimal inventory decisions. We also demonstrate how the findings can be used in a customer lifetime value model. Finally, the study investigates the effectiveness of different responses that firms can offer to mitigate the cost of stockouts. There is considerable variation in the effectiveness of these responses. Offering discounts to encourage customers to backorder rather than cancel their orders is widely used in practice, but that was the least profitable of the responses that we evaluated. The findings have important implications for retailers considering the use of discounts as a response to stockouts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0577","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on inventory management and the economic implications of stockouts without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This typology is based on the knowledge flows between the plants. In our research, network analysis has been used as a methodology for understanding the position of plants in international manufacturing networks. The focus has been primarily on the intangible knowledge network, and secondarily on the physical, logistic network. Our analysis leads to four types of plants with different network roles: the isolated plants, the receivers, the hosting network players, and the active network players. Our analysis shows that the different types of plants play a different strategic role in the company, have a different focus, and differ in age, autonomy, and level of resources and investments. Also, the analysis suggests that the evolution of the plant depends to some extent on the network role of the plant. Finally, two scenarios for the development of a strong network role are identified. The research is useful for the scholar studying the architecture of knowledge networks, as well as for the practitioner who is in charge of an international network of manufacturing units.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0582","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a typology of plants in manufacturing networks with an emphasis on knowledge flows and strategic roles, lacking any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We study the joint price/quantity newsvendor model where only a single quantity and price decision is made, such as a fashion or holiday product that cannot be replenished and where the price is advertised nationally and cannot be changed. Demand is uncertain and sensitive to price. We develop a method for easily finding the optimal price and quantity that applies to more general cases than the usual one in which uncertainty is either additive, multiplicative, or a combination of the two. We represent a quantity by its fractile of the probability distribution of demand for a given price. We use a standard approach to approximating a given distribution with a finite number of representative fractiles and assume that these fractile functions are piecewise linear functions of the price. We identify effects that are not usually seen in a joint price/quantity newsvendor model. For example, although the optimal quantity is a decreasing function of the unit cost, the optimal price can be nonmonotone in the unit cost and we shed insight into why. We illustrate that using a simplified structure of demand uncertainty can result in substantially lower profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0584","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and quantity decisions in a business context without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Finally, we find that in equilibrium, firms may choose to be different; one firm is decentralized and uses incentives that commit it to being aggressive, while the other is centralized and uses incentives that commit it to being soft.

The presence of such a local bias facilitates the persistence of incompatibilities. When local bias cannot be sustained in other interaction networks, one technology corners the market.

As time progresses and new information becomes available, the firms update their forecasts and have the option to trade their resources.

Assuming a fairly general form of the profit functions, we characterize the Nash equilibrium investment levels, which are first-best under the price equilibrium trade contract, but not under the bargaining equilibrium trade contract. To gain additional insights, we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a general forecast evolution process, we characterize the impact of the option to trade and the firms\u2019 cooperation on equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. Under this model, we prove that the equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0574","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and pricing strategies based on market forecasts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For typical payoffs, we obtain a pair of estimators (named low and high) with expectations that (1) are monotone along any such bridge sampler, and (2) contain the continuous-time price. These estimators provide pathwise bounds on unbiased estimators that would be more expensive (infinitely expensive in some situations) to compute. By using these bounds with extrapolation techniques, we obtain significant efficiency improvements by work reduction.

A comprehensive understanding of IS success thus remains elusive. In an attempt to address this situation, which may partly be due to the exclusion of potentially important constructs from prior parsimonious models of IS success, we present and test a comprehensive theoretical model. This model explains interrelationships among four constructs representing the success of a specific IS (user satisfaction, system use, perceived usefulness, and system quality), and the relationships of these IS success constructs with four user-related constructs (user experience with ISs, user training in ISs, user attitude toward ISs, and user participation in the development of the specific IS) and two constructs representing the context (top-management support for ISs and facilitating conditions for ISs). To test the model, we first used meta-analysis to compute a correlation matrix for the constructs in the model based on 612 findings from 121 studies published between 1980 and 2004, and then used this correlation matrix as input for a LISREL analysis of the model. Overall, we found excellent support for the theoretical model.

The rationing levels for each component are dynamic and also nondecreasing in the inventory level of all other components.

Realizing the value of such innovations, however, requires substantial follow-on investments in development and commercialization. The value of these investments is difficult to capture because of uncertain demand and potential competition. This often leads to difficulties in obtaining outside financing for these investments. In this paper, we explore how licensing contracts can both dissuade other firms from developing alternative technologies and alleviate the financing problem. We develop a model in which a firm that invests in the development efforts of an innovation can license its technology to a potential competitor. A variety of licensing possibilities is considered, including fixed fees, royalty schedules, and two-part licenses consisting of an up-front payment and a capped royalty schedule. When the firm has no financial constraint, a royalty schedule that depends on realized demand dominates a fixed fee per license. When investment funds are constrained, a royalty cap license with an up-front payment can serve as a source of financing. We also study the investment problem conditional on the licensing and financing decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0589","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of licensing and financing in technology development without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a dynamic model of service contract renewal for an individual firm, at the contract level, recognizing interdependencies among service contract renewal decisions due to the firm\u2019s purchase of multiple contracts from the same supplier. The decision to renew a service contract is modeled as a function of service quality and price, where service quality is measured by the supplier\u2019s service operations metrics over time. By incorporating longitudinal data about the supplier\u2019s service operations, this study investigates how average service levels, variability in service levels (especially extreme outcomes), and timing of service delivery influence firms\u2019 service contract renewal decisions. The study context is support services for high-technology systems in business markets in Germany and the United Kingdom, where service operations metrics over time typically have skewed distributions. Firm behavior is represented by a binary choice model at the contract level, estimated as a binary response model with a complementary log-log link function incorporating random intercepts. The study shows that a firm that has a few extremely favorable experiences for a given service contract is more likely to subsequently renew that service contract, after controlling for average service levels. Firms weigh recent experiences (i.e., within the past year)\u2014rather than earlier experiences\u2014when deciding whether or not to renew, so the timing of service experiences may be critical to the survival of buyer-seller relationships. Overall, the study suggests that models of customer retention should incorporate the extent, variability, and timing of a supplier\u2019s service delivery over time at the contract/product level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0594","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service quality and customer retention without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0597","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of common method variance in survey research without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In contrast, for firms with specialized complementary assets, increases in patent effectiveness increase patenting propensity but reduce the propensity to license.

What are the determinants of product line actions? To what extent are product line actions proactive? To what degree are they reactive? How can a firm\u2019s product line action elasticity (percent change in product line length with respect to percent change in competitor\u2019s past and anticipated actions) be decomposed into reaction and anticipation elasticities? Are product line actions and elasticities symmetric across market leaders and followers? To address these questions, we develop a conceptual framework comprising determinants of product line and other marketing actions in a single framework. We formulate hypotheses about the asymmetries between market leaders and followers regarding product line actions based on extended expectancy-valence and competitive demand elasticity theories. We develop a simultaneous equation model of demand and supply with product line and other marketing actions, which can be used to identify reaction and anticipation elasticities through the rational expectations approach. We estimate the model using data from the computer printer market comprising the market leader, Hewlett Packard (HP), and followers: Epson, Canon, and Lexmark. The results show that the market leader practices a product-proliferation strategy and rarely fights on price. In contrast, market followers adopt a price-fighting strategy. A firm is more likely to engage in product line actions when its competitors changed their product lines in the past, when the firm is large, and when its price is high. Product line reaction and anticipation elasticities are asymmetric between themselves and across the firms. For the market leader (followers), product line reaction elasticity is higher (lower) than product line anticipation elasticity. These differences are related to product line demand elasticities, which are higher for the market leader than they are for the followers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0443","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product line strategies and market dynamics without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this setup, start-up firms emerge when the established firm is generating many innovations or is selective because the option value of waiting is high, or both.

Longitudinal field data show that corporate entrepreneurs follow a \u201cmoving, anchored search\u201d for growth possibilities. Employing this framework as lens, we develop propositions. We find that corporate entrepreneurs are more likely to conduct search in new domains following events that cause them to expect future performance to change significantly and lastingly. This is in contrast to the literature that has typically modeled the initiation of search as a response to poor past performance. Because new domains are unexplored territories for corporate entrepreneurs, they utilize transitional levers that they perceive will facilitate the move from existing domains to new ones. These perceived transitional levers, however, typically prove inaccurate or incomplete. Content within domains is searched using anchors whose locations and numbers change. The combination of search process and content searched influences the particular growth possibilities discovered and created.

Results from three studies supported this hypothesis. Pre-exposure to product attribute levels undermined the impact of attribute priming, decision framing, and asymmetric dominance on preferential choices.

We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We conduct two experiments on two different sets of participants. In the first, we find the bullwhip effect still exists when normal operational causes (e.g., batching, price fluctuations, demand estimation, etc.) are removed. The persistence of the bullwhip effect is explained to some extent by evidence that decision makers consistently underweight the supply line when making order decisions. In the second experiment, we find that the bullwhip, and the underlying tendency of underweighting, remains when information on inventory levels is shared. However, we observe that inventory information helps somewhat to alleviate the bullwhip effect by helping upstream chain members better anticipate and prepare for fluctuations in inventory needs downstream. These experimental results support the theoretically suggested notion that upstream chain members stand to gain the most from information-sharing initiatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0436","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of the bullwhip effect in supply chains without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we model a software firm\u2019s trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and investments in fixing it later. Just as the marginal cost of producing software can be effectively zero, so can the marginal cost of repairing multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a software vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it later in a larger market. Thus, a software monopolist releases a product with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We contrast this result with physical good markets where market size does not play any role in quality provision. We also show that for comparable costs, a software monopolist releases the product with more bugs but invests more in post-patching support later than the physical good monopolist.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0440","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software quality and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2006","52","3","Viswanath VenkateshViswanath Venkateshvvenkatesh@vvenkatesh.usSam M.

The approach is illustrated for cost estimation in production planning using linear programming models. The method uses past planning data to estimate costs that are otherwise difficult to estimate. We define a monetary measure of distance between observed plans and optimal ones, called decisional regret. The proposed estimation algorithm finds parameter values for which the associated optimal plans are as near as possible to the observed ones on average. Such techniques may be called behavioral estimation because they are based on the observed planning or decision-making behavior of managers or firms. Two numerical illustrations are given. A supporting hyperplane algorithm is used to solve the estimation model. A method is proposed for obtaining range estimates of the parameters when multiple alternative estimates exist.

Other optimization-based processes operate in a similar manner. With uncertainty and limited resources, an analysis is never perfect, so these value estimates are subject to error. We show that if we take these value estimates at face value and select accordingly, we should expect the value of the chosen alternative to be less than its estimate, even if the value estimates are unbiased. Thus, when comparing actual outcomes to value estimates, we should expect to be disappointed on average, not because of any inherent bias in the estimates themselves, but because of the optimization-based selection process. We call this phenomenon the optimizer\u2019s curse and argue that it is not well understood or appreciated in the decision analysis and management science communities. This curse may be a factor in creating skepticism in decision makers who review the results of an analysis. In this paper, we study the optimizer\u2019s curse and show that the resulting expected disappointment may be substantial. We then propose the use of Bayesian methods to adjust value estimates. These Bayesian methods can be viewed as disciplined skepticism and provide a method for avoiding this postdecision disappointment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0451","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on decision analysis and optimization processes without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

We explore whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Do organizations learn to reduce customer dissatisfaction? Customer dissatisfaction occurs when customers\u2019 ex ante expectations about a product or service exceed ex post perceptions about the product or service. Because customers can increase expectations over time, customer dissatisfaction may not decline even when the product or service improves. Consequently, it is an open question whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Drawing from the literatures on learning curves and organizational learning, we hypothesize that customer dissatisfaction follows a U-shaped function of operating experience (Hypothesis 1), that focused airlines learn faster to reduce customer dissatisfaction than full-service airlines (Hypothesis 2), and that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction are heterogeneous across airlines (Hypothesis 3). We test these hypotheses with quarterly data covering 1987 to 1998 on consumer complaints against the 10 largest U.S. airlines. We find strong support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 2 is not supported in the sense that the average focused airline did not learn faster than the average full-service airline. However, we do find that the best focused airline learns faster than the best full-service airline. We explore this result by extending a knowledge-based view of managing productivity learning curves in factories to complaint learning curves in airlines.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0462","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['customer dissatisfaction', 'organizational learning', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on organizational performance and customer dissatisfaction without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

For managers of these products the challenges are to predict when and how much the products will change and to understand how their development decisions influence the timing and magnitude of future change activities. We develop a two-stage model that relates environmental volatility to product development decisions and product development decisions to software volatility. The model is evaluated using a data archive that captures changes over 20 years to a firm\u2019s environment, its managers\u2019 development choices, and its software products. In Stage 1 we find that higher environmental volatility leads to greater use of process technology and standard component designs but less team member rotation. Earlier development decisions strongly influence current development choices, especially for product design and process technology. In Stage 2 we find that increased use of standard component designs dampens future software volatility by decreasing the average rate and magnitude of change. Adding new team members increases product enhancements at a faster pace than more intense use of process technology but adds repairs at almost the same rate as enhancements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0463","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of product development and software volatility without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Applying extant theoretical and modeling perspectives, especially from branding, spatial competition, and channels, we show that although each of the three roles has its unique domain of optimality, the co-optor role is the most widely optimal for the MPCB; it is profit maximizing even when the end products are strong (but not perfect) substitutes, an alternative component is available and the downstream market is saturated. Optimal prices under the co-optor role are higher than under the other roles.

For a variety of heavy tail service time distributions, characterized by large coefficient of variations, analytical and numerical comparisons show that our scheme provides better system performance than the standard parallel multiserver model in the sense of reducing the mean delay per customer in heavy traffic systems.

Reverse auctions do not have this flexibility, because it is the auction rules and not the buyer that determines the winner. In practice, however, hybrid mechanisms that remove some suppliers and a corresponding amount of demand from the auction market are quite common. We find that in theory such hybrid mechanisms increase competition and make buyers better off as long as suppliers are willing to accept noncompetitive contracts. It turns out that suppliers often do because under a wide variety of conditions, these contracts have a positive expected profit. Our theory relies on two behavioral assumptions: (1) bidders in a multiunit uniform-price reverse auction will follow the dominant strategy of bidding truthfully, and (2) the suppliers who have been removed from the market will accept noncompetitive contracts that have a positive expected profit. Our experiment demonstrates that bidders in the auction behave very close to following the dominant strategy regardless of whether this auction is a stand-alone or a part of a hybrid mechanism. We also find that suppliers accept noncompetitive contracts sufficiently often (although not always) to make the hybrid mechanism outperform the reverse auction in the laboratory as well as in theory.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0474","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement and auction mechanisms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In a dynamic setting, we demonstrate how a risk-averse portfolio manager optimally under- or overperforms a target benchmark under different economic conditions, depending on his attitude towards risk and choice of the benchmark.

As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0493","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and fulfillment capabilities in internet retailing without addressing social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our research explores the extent to which an advertiser should allocate resources to increase the quality of its targeting. We present a game-theoretic model that extends the conventional measurement of targeting quality by exploring the trade-off between two measures: accuracy and recognition. Accuracy measures the likelihood that any target segment prediction is correct, while recognition conversely measures the likelihood that any member of the target segment is identified. We find that the relative resources allocated to improving accuracy and recognition depend upon the size of the population of viewers, the propensity of viewers to skip commercials, the overall cost of airing commercials, and the competitive environment. Furthermore, the incentives to improve accuracy are markedly different from those to improve recognition. Although improving accuracy does not affect the extent of price competition, improving recognition leads to intensified price competition and reduced profitability in the product market. Thus, when facing a competitor that pursues a strategy to improve its recognition of potential customers, an advertiser should choose to reduce its investment in recognition and increase its investment in accuracy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0489","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['targeting', 'demographic profiles', 'accuracy', 'recognition']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of targeted advertising and resource allocation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

There is a fixed cost per production run and a variable cost per unit produced, both of which may vary by period. We characterize properties of the optimal solution, considering cases with constant and time-varying capacity, and with and without speculative motive for holding inventory. We show that, counter to intuition, optimal prices may increase as the capacity increases, even when capacity is constant over the horizon. We also show that increases in capacity do not always exhibit diminishing marginal returns. Our procedure produces solutions with much higher profits than can be obtained from a sophisticated sequential procedure in which a well-informed and optimum-seeking marketing department makes pricing decisions and the manufacturing department seeks to satisfy the resulting demands at minimum cost. Our results also suggest that firms with seasonal demand and tight capacity constraints should be more aggressive in setting prices to manage their demands than what is typically done in practice.

In this paper, we extend this line of research to determine the industry structures and patterns of expected firm profits for the case when difficulty optimizing interdependent activities does, in fact, generate and sustain capability heterogeneity among firms. We combine a widely used agent-based model where firms search to discover sets of activities that complement one another (reducing overall costs or raising product quality) with traditional economic models of competition among profit-maximizing firms. The agent-based model produces a distribution of performance (interpreted as variable cost or product quality) among firms and the competition models determine resulting industry outcomes including patterns of entry, exit, and profits. The integration of economic models of competition among firms with an agent-based model of search for improvement by firms reveals a rich relationship between interdependencies in production functions and industry structure, firm profits, and industry average profitability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0495","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on economic models and firm profitability without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

The comparison between virtual experimental results and relevant laboratory experimental results demonstrates the validity of ORGMEM as a useful tool to study memory-related phenomena. Through a series of virtual experiments, we find that TM decreases group response time by facilitating knowledge retrieval processes and improves decision quality by informing task coordination and evaluation. Our results also suggest that the effects of TM are contingent upon group characteristics, such as group size and environment, as well as the dimension along which group performance is assessed.

We analyze general quasi-linear utility functions among asymmetric agents with an arbitrary number of finite types, in the context of incentive-compatible direct revelation games. A key part of the analysis is the relationship between expected benefit functions that feature alternative forms of supermodularity that translate into relaxations or restrictions of the original problem. The required features can be attained with a range of assumptions on the model primitives, each of which can support the results. This unified approach can suggest a range of alternative assumption combinations, often more general than their counterparts in the continuous-space literature, and each of which can reduce the problem to a more tractable form. Also, mechanism design problems with finite-type spaces can require conscious attention to how the principal handles ties, which are probability-zero events, and hence innocuous in continuous spaces.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0502","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mechanism design without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We illustrate the applicability of data shuffling for small and large data sets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0503","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical procedure for data masking with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In practice, the current approach to the problem is invariably myopic: firms send catalogs to customers who they think are most likely to order from that catalog. In doing so, the firms overlook the long-run implications of these decisions. For example, it may be profitable to mail to customers who are unlikely to order immediately if sending the current catalog increases the probability of a future order. We propose a model that allows firms to optimize mailing decisions by addressing the dynamic implications of their decisions. The model is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. We apply the model to a large sample of historical data provided by a catalog firm and then evaluate its performance in a large-scale field test. The findings offer support for the proposed model but also identify opportunities for further improvement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0504","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing mailing decisions for catalog firms based on profitability and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier\u2019s percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse. Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firm\u2019s costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0515","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['disruption', 'risk', 'mitigation']","The article primarily focuses on technical strategies for managing supply chain risks and disruptions, with no significant emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

In this context, designing a special class of products that we term development-intensive products (DIPs)\u2014for which the fixed costs of development far outweigh the unit-variable costs\u2014presents some unique managerial challenges. Examples of such development-intensive offerings abound in a number of industries, including the pharmaceutical, information, and entertainment sectors of the economy. Our contributions in this paper are threefold: (a) to show that managerial insights from the traditional approach to product-line design developed for unit-variable cost-intensive products do not carry over to DIPs, (b) to present new mechanisms and managerial guidelines for designing a family of products for which development costs cannot be ignored, and (c) to illustrate the insights with an extended industry example. We find that the design approach based on degrading (or subtracting value from) a high-end product to obtain a subsumed low-end edition, shown in the literature to be an effective approach for designing unit cost-intensive products, can be inappropriate for DIPs. This limitation of value subtraction has implications for the number of variants and the sequence in which they are developed. As an alternative to a subsumed product-design strategy, we propose and examine the overlapped product-design approach, in which a low-end product is not completely subsumed within its high-end counterpart, but differentiated on additional vertical quality dimensions. Our results both explain the recent challenges of firms with subsumed low-end products and guide them in designing a product line to successfully address emerging low-end market segments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0492","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on product design and managerial challenges without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A potential problem is that the personal tax effect is ignored in these models. In this paper, we employ a structural model to investigate the role of personal taxes on both debt and equity returns in capital structure decisions and assess their impact on corporate bond yield spreads. It is shown that personal taxes affect the firm\u2019s optimal capital structure, and the tax premium explains a substantial portion of yield spreads, especially for high-grade bonds. The predictive ability of the model for yield spreads is much improved when personal tax effects are accounted for.

The supplier declares her estimate of the ability to meet the order obligations, but the buyer may have a different estimate, which may be higher or lower than the supplier\u2019s estimate. We derive the Nash bargaining solution and discuss the role of using a down-payment or nondelivery penalty in the contract. For the case of buyer overtrust, the down-payment contract maximizes channel profits when the supplier\u2019s estimate is public information. If the supplier\u2019s estimate is private information, a nonsymmetric contract is shown to be efficient and incentive compatible. For the case of buyer undertrust, the contract structure is quite different as both players choose not to include down-payments in the contract. When delivery estimates are public information, a nondelivery penalty contract is able to maximize channel profits if the buyer uses the supplier\u2019s estimate in making the ordering decision. If estimates are private information, channel profits are maximized only if the true estimates of both players are not far part. We also discuss the effect of different risk profiles on the nature of the bargaining solution. In three extensions of the model, we consider the following variants of the basic problem. First, we analyze the effect of early versus late negotiation on the bargaining solution. Then, we study the case of endogenous supply reliability, and finally, for the case of repeated interactions, we discuss the impact of updating delivery estimates on the order quantity and negotiated prices of future orders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0498","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical bargaining model related to supply reliability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our approach preserves the form of the original problem in that an investor minimizes portfolio variance for a given level of the expected return. However, inputs are now given by the generalized expressions for mean and variance-covariance matrix involving moments of the random exit time in addition to the conditional moments of asset returns. Although efficient frontiers in the generalized and the standard Markowitz case may coincide under certain conditions, we demonstrate that, by means of an example, in general that is not true. In particular, portfolios efficient in the standard Markowitz sense can be inefficient in the generalized sense and vice versa. As a result, an investor facing an uncertain time horizon and investing as if her time of exit is certain would in general make suboptimal portfolio allocation decisions. Numerical simulations show that a significant efficiency loss can be induced by an improper use of standard mean-variance analysis when time horizon is uncertain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0507","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio optimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For new product innovations, a large literature has been developed on the basis of the celebrated Bass diffusion process, which captures what we call market-size dynamics. However, in spite of the significant literature incorporating competitiveness into the Bass model, few if any analytical results have been obtained, especially those with normative implications. On the other hand, important theoretical and empirical insights have recently been obtained using the famous Lanchester warfare model of competition, in which market-share dynamics are governed by advertising activities for mature products whose market sizes are typically fixed or stable. Our paper seeks to address the issue of optimal advertising strategies incorporating both market-share dynamics and market-size dynamics. In doing so, we seek to take advantage of the theoretical and normative insights currently available in the Lanchester formulation for mature products to obtain normative, analytical results on competitive advertising strategies for new product innovations whose markets evolve around the Bass process. We first obtain analytical solutions to the problem at hand and offer theoretical implications for competitive advertising on the Bass diffusion model. The model\u2019s parameters are then estimated using a set of data on sales and advertising expenditures of Polaroid Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co. in instant photography during the 1976\u20131985 period; optimal trajectories for the firms\u2019 advertising spending are then calculated, and other marketing and managerial implications of optimal advertising strategies are explored.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0509","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising strategies and market dynamics without any mention of social themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

The buyer seeks to minimize the sum of her procurement and operating costs, the latter of which depends on the supplier\u2019s lead time. The selected supplier can regulate his lead time, but faster lead times are costly. Although the buyer selects the supplier to source from (possibly via an auction) and dictates the contractual terms, the buyer\u2019s bargaining power is limited by asymmetric information: The buyer only has an estimate of the suppliers\u2019 costs, while the suppliers know their costs precisely. We identify a procurement mechanism that minimizes the buyer\u2019s total cost (procurement plus operating). This mechanism is not simple: It is a numerically derived nonlinear menu of contracts. Therefore, we study several simpler mechanisms: e.g., one that charges a late fee and one that specifies a fixed lead-time requirement (no menus, no nonlinear functions). We find that simple mechanisms are nearly optimal (generally within 1% of optimal) because asymmetric information conveys significant protection to the supplier, i.e., the supplier is able to retain most of the benefit of having a lower cost. Renegotiation is another concern with the optimal mechanism: Because it does not minimize the supply chain\u2019s cost, the firms can be both better off if they throw away the contract and start over. Interestingly, we find that the potential gain from renegotiation is relatively small with either the optimal or our simple mechanisms. We conclude that our simple mechanisms are quite attractive along all relevant dimensions: buyer\u2019s performance, supply chain performance, simplicity, and robustness to renegotiation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0510","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of procurement mechanisms and information asymmetry without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0512","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Statistically, we devise a constrained finite-mixture structural-equation procedure that simultaneously accounts for firm capabilities, performance outcomes, and the relationships between them. The procedure allows for a comprehensive modeling and grouping of entities, and simultaneously provides a diagnosis of the sources of heterogeneity via the flexibility of estimating a series of nested models. Managerially, our proposed methodology is grounded in the strategic type and RBV literature and can capture the effects of environmental and industry-specific factors. Using data obtained from 216 SBUs in the United States for illustration, the results show that our derived four mixed-type solution dominates the four-group, Prospectors-Analyzers-Defenders-Reactors classification as well as a number of other nested model solutions in terms of objective statistical fit criteria for this data set, suggesting a more contingency-driven strategic stance adopted by these SBUs.

We develop a framework to characterize the optimal two-sided pricing strategy of a platform firm; that is, the pricing strategy toward the direct users of the platform as well as toward firms offering applications that are complementary to the platform. We compare industry structures based on a proprietary platform (such as Windows) with those based on an open source platform (such as Linux), and analyze the structure of competition and industry implications in terms of pricing, sales, profitability, and social welfare. We find that, when the platform is proprietary, the equilibrium prices for the platform, the applications, and the platform access fee for applications may be below marginal cost, and we characterize demand conditions that lead to this. The proprietary applications sector of an industry based on an open source platform may be more profitable than the total profits of a proprietary platform industry. When users have a strong preference for application variety, the total profits of the proprietary industry are larger than the total profits of an industry based on an open source platform. The variety of applications is larger when the platform is open source. When a system based on an open source platform with an independent proprietary application competes with a proprietary system, the proprietary system is likely to dominate the open source platform industry both in terms of market share and profitability. This may explain the dominance of Microsoft in the market for PC operating systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0549","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['open source', 'proprietary', 'social welfare']","The article discusses open source versus proprietary platforms, touching on social welfare, but primarily focuses on technical and economic aspects of competition rather than social justice or equity themes.

To better understand the workings of open source environments, we examine the effects of network embeddedness\u2014or the nature of the relationship among projects and developers\u2014on the success of open source projects. We find that considerable heterogeneity exists in the network embeddedness of open source projects and project managers. We use a visual representation of the affiliation network of projects and developers as well as a formal statistical analysis to demonstrate this heterogeneity and to investigate how these structures differ across projects and project managers. Our main results surround the effect of this differential network embeddedness on project success. We find that network embeddedness has strong and significant effects on both technical and commercial success, but that those effects are quite complex. We use latent class regression analysis to show that multiple regimes exist and that some of the effects of network embeddedness are positive under some regimes and negative under others. We use project age and number of page views to provide insights into the direction of the effect of network embeddedness on project success.

This raises serious concerns that concentration of development effort on a few will limit knowledge sharing and underutilize the available resources. Using the notion of strategic interaction, this paper argues that individual developers often interact strategically with other highly resourceful developers by forming a smaller but better organized structure to intensify the types of epistemic interactions that matter most to the OSS development. A general framework of strategic interaction including participation inequality, conversational interactivity, and cross-thread connectivity is proposed to examine its impact on knowledge sharing, and validated using 128 discussion threads from the K Desktop Environment (KDE) developer mailing list. The findings indicate that strategic interaction has expanded knowledge sharing but with the caveat that extreme concentration of development could have an opposite effect. For researchers, this study dovetails the incentive logic by proposing and validating the strategic aspects of OSS participation to better understand the collective dynamics underpinning OSS development. Practitioners can use this approach to evaluate and better support existing knowledge-sharing initiatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0551","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['knowledge sharing', 'participation inequality', 'open source software']","The article discusses participation inequality in open source software development, which touches on themes of inclusivity and resource utilization.

We use design structure matrices (DSMs) to map dependencies between the elements of a design and define metrics that allow us to compare the structures of different designs. We use these metrics to compare the architectures of two software products\u2014the Linux operating system and the Mozilla Web browser\u2014that were developed via contrasting modes of organization: specifically, open source versus proprietary development. We then track the evolution of Mozilla, paying attention to a purposeful \u201credesign\u201d effort undertaken with the intention of making the product more \u201cmodular.\u201d We find significant differences in structure between Linux and the first version of Mozilla, suggesting that Linux had a more modular architecture. Yet we also find that the redesign of Mozilla resulted in an architecture that was significantly more modular than that of its predecessor and, indeed, than that of Linux. Our results, while exploratory, are consistent with a view that different modes of organization are associated with designs that possess different structures. However, they also suggest that purposeful managerial actions can have a significant impact in adapting a design\u2019s structure.

This paper inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two software communities with different governance structures. In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code. Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine the advantages of open source software development with proprietary ownership and control are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0553","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['governance', 'participation', 'community']","The article discusses governance structures and individual participation in open source software development, which hints at collaborative and community-oriented themes.

Our study contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation, and performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important findings. First, we find that developers\u2019 motivations are not independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers\u2019 status motivations but negatively related to their use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways. Developers\u2019 paid participation and status motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that developers\u2019 contribution levels positively impact their performance rankings.

Timeshare exchanges allow for the weeks to be redistributed among members to better match their preferences and thus increase efficiency. As such, the problem falls within the domain of matching problems, which have recently gained much attention in academia. We demonstrate theoretically that the two major timeshare exchange mechanisms used currently (deposit-first mechanism and request-first mechanism) can cause efficiency loss. We propose an alternate exchange mechanism, the top trading cycles chains and spacebank (TTCCS) mechanism, and show that it can increase the efficiency of the timeshare exchange market because TTCCS is Pareto efficient, individually rational, and strategyproof. We test the three exchange mechanisms in laboratory experiments where we simulate exchange markets with networked \u201ctimeshare members.\u201d The results of the experiments are robust across four different environments that we construct and strongly support our theory.

This paper examines this seemingly puzzling situation. I argue that weak IPR leads to low returns to innovation and underutilization of innovative talents; MNEs that possess alternative mechanisms for protecting their intellectual properties will therefore find it attractive to conduct R&D at those locations. A theoretical framework is developed to capture the interaction between firm strategy and the institutional environment. The empirical analysis on a sample of 1,567 U.S.-headquartered innovating firms finds results consistent with the hypotheses that (i) technologies developed in countries with weak IPR protection are used more internally, and (ii) technologies developed by firms with R&D in weak IPR countries show stronger internal linkages. The results suggest that firms may use internal organizations to substitute for inadequate external institutions. By doing so, they are able to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities presented by the institutional gap across countries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0516","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['intellectual property', 'innovation', 'institutional environment']","The article discusses the implications of weak intellectual property rights and how they affect innovation and firm strategy, but it does not emphasize social justice or equity themes.

This project focuses on a related problem faced by homeowners who may be reluctant to file insurance claims despite the fact their losses are covered. We model this consumer decision by introducing the concept of the \u201cpseudodeductible,\u201d a latent threshold above the policy deductible that governs the homeowner\u2019s claim behavior. In addition, we show how the observed number of claims can be modeled as the output of three stochastic processes that are separately, and in conjunction, managerially relevant: the rate at which losses occur, the size of each loss, and the choice of the individual to file or not file a claim. By allowing for the possibility of pseudodeductibles, one can sort out (and make accurate inferences about) these three processes. We test this model using a proprietary data set provided by State Farm, the largest underwriter of personal lines insurance in the United States. Using mixtures of Dirichlet processes to capture heterogeneity and the interplay among the three processes, we uncover several relevant \u201cstories\u201d that underlie the frequency and severity of claims. For instance, some customers have a small number of losses, but all are filed as claims, whereas others may experience many more losses, but are more selective about which claims they file. These stories explain several observed phenomena regarding the claims decisions that insurance customers make, and have broad implications for customer lifetime value and market segmentation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0517","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior in insurance claims without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The supplier is responsible for acquiring the necessary capacity before receiving an order from the manufacturer who possesses private forecast information for her end product. We address how different contracts affect the supplier\u2019s capacity decision and, hence, the profitability of the supplier and the manufacturer. We fully develop two contracts (and provide explicit formulae) to enable credible forecast information sharing. The first is a nonlinear capacity reservation contract under which the manufacturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity. The second is an advance purchase contract under which the manufacturer is induced to place a firm order before the supplier secures the component capacity used to build the end product. These contracts serve a strategic role in information sharing. The capacity reservation contract enables the supplier to detect the manufacturer\u2019s private forecast information, while the advance purchase contract enables the manufacturer to signal her forecast information. We show that channel coordination is possible even under asymmetric forecast information by combining the advance purchase contract with an appropriate payback agreement. Through our structural and numerical results we also show that the degree of forecast information asymmetry and the risk-adjusted profit margin are two important drivers that determine supply chain efficiency and which contract to adopt.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0521","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The value of commercial product returns, which we define as products returned for any reason within 90 days of sale, now exceeds $100 billion annually in the United States. Although the reverse supply chain of returned products represents a sizeable flow of potentially recoverable assets, only a relatively small fraction of the value is currently extracted by manufacturers; a large proportion of the product value erodes away because of long processing delays. Thus, there are significant opportunities to build competitive advantage from making the appropriate reverse supply chain design choices. In this paper, we present a network flow with delay models that includes the marginal value of time to identify the drivers of reverse supply chain design.

By contrast, external rivals pose a lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing to use their knowledge. We conducted three studies.

Study 2 explored the types of threat that insiders and outsiders evoked. In particular, people assumed that they would lose more personal status if they used an internal rival\u2019s knowledge and, therefore, reduced their valuation of that knowledge.

Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive frameworks acquired through experience (e.g., prototypes) play a central role in this process. Such frameworks provide individuals with a basis for noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in markets, changes in government policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these connections. We propose that ideas for new products or services often emerge from the perception of such patterns. New business opportunities are identified when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks, \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then detect patterns in these connections suggestive of new products or services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the \u201cbusiness opportunity\u201d prototypes of novice (first-time) and repeat (experienced) entrepreneurs\u2014their cognitive representations of the essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly defined, richer in content, and more concerned with factors and conditions related to actually starting and running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash flow) than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs.

Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of: certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is solvable in polynomial time.

In the aftermath of Y2K, critics charged that the problem was overblown and that companies overspent on IT. In contrast, we posit in this paper that efforts companies made to renew and upgrade their IT may have positioned them to take advantage of new e-business applications. As Y2K approached, managers could invest opportunistically in IT, which would enable them to connect with customers and suppliers in new ways. Contrary to the alleged overspending, we find that firm value increased, on average, with Y2K spending by Fortune 1000 companies. In particular, higher firm value and subsequent earnings were associated with Y2K spending for firms in industries where IT was considered to have a transforming influence\u2014altering traditional ways of doing business by redefining business processes and relationships. We also test whether the positive association between firm value and Y2K spending diminished with Y2K spending by industry peer firms, but we do not find support for this relative investment hypothesis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0542","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial implications of IT investments without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or diversity themes.

This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer\u2019s sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early. We characterize the manufacturer\u2019s sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late.

The implication is that any operational system that has minimized inefficiencies is also more environmentally sustainable. However, in this paper we argue that the underlying mechanism is one of extending the horizons of analysis and that this applies to both theory and practice of operations management. We illustrate this through two principal areas of lean operations, where we identify how successive extensions of the prevailing research horizon in each area have led to major advances in theory and practice. First, in quality management, the initial emphasis on statistical quality control of individual operations was extended through total quality management to include a broader process encompassing customer requirements and suppliers\u2019 operations. More recently, the environmental perspective extended the definition of customers to stakeholders and defects to any form of waste. Second, in supply chain management, the horizon first expanded from the initial focus on optimizing inventory control with a single planner to including multiple organizations with conflicting objectives and private information. The environmental perspective draws attention to aspects such as reverse flows and end-of-life product disposal, again potentially improving the performance of the overall supply chain. In both cases, these developments were initially driven by practice, where many of the benefits of adopting an environmental perspective were unexpected. Given that these unexpected side benefits seem to recur so frequently, we refer to this phenomenon as the \u201claw of the expected unexpected side benefits.\u201d We conclude by extrapolating from the developmental paths of total quality management and supply chain management to speculate about the future of environmental research in operations management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0095","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['environmental', 'sustainability', 'stakeholders', 'waste']","The article discusses the importance of an environmental perspective in operations management, emphasizing sustainability and stakeholder considerations, which align with socially progressive themes.

Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0097","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['procurement', 'relational contracts', 'supply chain']","The article focuses primarily on economic efficiency and competition between procurement models without addressing social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently. Our results suggest that unless firms jointly manage these online channels, they may find that adding auctions actually reduces their revenues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0101","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online selling strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We assume that the available production capacity is limited and that unmet demand is lost. We incorporate discretionary sales, when inventory may be set aside to satisfy future demand even if some present demand is lost. We analyze and compare partial planning or delayed strategies. In delayed strategies, one decision may be planned in advance, whereas a second decision is delayed until the beginning of each time period, after observing the results of previous decisions. For example, in delayed production (delayed pricing), pricing (production) is determined at the beginning of the horizon, and the production (pricing) decision is made at the beginning of each period before new customer orders are received. A special case is where a single price is chosen over the horizon. We describe policies and heuristics for the strategies based on deterministic approximations and analyze their performances. Computational analysis yields additional insights about the strategies, such as that delayed production is usually better than delayed pricing except sometimes when capacity is tight. On average, the delayed production (pricing) heuristic achieved 99.3% (99.8%) of the corresponding optimal strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0100","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing, production, and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine the case where a firm introduces multiple generations of a durable product for which demand is characterized by a demand diffusion process. Under fixed introduction costs, we consider the case where available product technology improves stochastically. As such, delaying introduction to a later date may lead to the capture of further technology improvements, potentially at the cost of slowing sales for the existing product (and a decline in market potential for the product to be introduced, given our focus on durable products). We specify a state-based model of demand diffusion and construct a decision model to solve the firm\u2019s introduction timing problem. By incorporating technology improvement in our model, we prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy governing the firm\u2019s product-introduction decisions. Numerical analysis reveals the influence of key model parameters on the pace of product introduction.

The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study.

All other things being equal, is an airline\u2019s expected revenue larger in the market with larger demand? If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis? In this article, we provide answers to these questions by studying the relationship between the optimal expected revenue and the demand distributions when the latter are comparable according to various stochastic orders. For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to \u201csell ups,\u201d we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.) For a problem with an arbitrary number of fare classes and independent demands, we show that stochastically larger demand distributions should be preferred.

The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience. Convenient closed-form expressions for the overall performance as a function of model elements are derived when either the agent-retention distribution or the performance function has exponential structure. Management actions may cause the agent-retention distribution to change.

First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system\u2019s competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm\u2019s head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified.

Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers\u2019 inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management\u2019s ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0111","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for lack of woke themes."],["2006","8","4","Mark FergusonMark Fergusonmark.ferguson@mgt.gatech.eduCollege of Management, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0520Search for more papers by this author, V.

The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0112","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and profitability related to false failure returns, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement \u201csupply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000\u201d into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country\u2019s management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0120","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['supply chains', 'global diffusion', 'certification']","The article discusses the role of supply chains in the diffusion of ISO 9000 certification, which touches on operational standards but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

How does the value of the optimal decision variable change with a more informative signal? In this paper, we show that if the payoff function is separable in the random variable, then one model can simultaneously answer both questions. This result holds for the reaction functions and equilibria of noncooperative games, as well as for single decision makers, with virtually no restrictions on the payoff functions. This is useful because otherwise it is very difficult to get at general results on the impact of learning. Furthermore, we clarify why the impacts of risk and a more informative signal are different when the payoff function is nonlinear in the random variable. It is because the directional impacts of informativeness are independent of risk attitude; the impacts of risk are not.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0213","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making under uncertainty without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Motivated by telephone call centers, the focus is on multiserver queues with a large number of servers and nonexponential service-time and time-to-abandon distributions. The first fluid model serves as an approximation for the G/GI/s+GI queueing model, which has a general stationary arrival process with arrival rate \u03bb, independent and identically distributed (IID) service times with a general distribution, s servers and IID abandon times with a general distribution. The fluid model is useful in the overloaded regime, where \u03bb > s, which is often realistic because only a small amount of abandonment can keep the system stable. Numerical experiments, using simulation for M/GI/s+GI models and exact numerical algorithms for M/M/s+M models, show that the fluid model provides useful approximations for steady-state performance measures when the system is heavily loaded. The fluid model accurately shows that steady-state performance depends strongly upon the time-to-abandon distribution beyond its mean, but not upon the service-time distribution beyond its mean. The second fluid model is a discrete-time fluid model, which serves as an approximation for the Gt (n)/GI/s+GI queueing model, having a state-dependent and time-dependent arrival process. The discrete-time framework is exploited to prove that properly scaled queueing processes in the queueing model converge to fluid functions as s \u2192 \u221e. The discrete-time framework is also convenient for calculating the time-dependent fluid performance descriptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0227","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fluid models in queueing theory without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

This problem has been studied in the past using dynamic programming, which suffers from dimensionality problems and assumes full knowledge of the demand distribution. The proposed approach takes into account the uncertainty of the demand in the supply chain without assuming a specific distribution, while remaining highly tractable and providing insight into the corresponding optimal policy. It also allows adjustment of the level of robustness of the solution to trade off performance and protection against uncertainty. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is its numerical tractability, especially when compared to multidimensional dynamic programming problems in complex supply chains, as the robust problem is of the same difficulty as the nominal problem, that is, a linear programming problem when there are no fixed costs, and a mixed-integer programming problem when fixed costs are present. Furthermore, we show that the optimal policy obtained in the robust approach is identical to the optimal policy obtained in the nominal case for a modified and explicitly computable demand sequence. In this way, we show that the structure of the optimal robust policy is of the same base-stock character as the optimal stochastic policy for a wide range of inventory problems in single installations, series systems, and general supply chains. Preliminary computational results are very promising.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0238","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory theory and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

With the first supplier, the buyer incurs a high variable cost but negligible fixed cost; with the second supplier, the buyer incurs a lower variable cost but a substantial fixed cost. Consequently, ordering costs are piecewise linear and concave. We show that a reduced form of generalized (s, S) policy is optimal for both finite and (discounted) infinite-horizon problems, provided that the demand density is log-concave. This condition on the distribution is much less restrictive than in previous models. In particular, it applies to the normal, truncated normal, gamma, and beta distributions, which were previously excluded. We concentrate on the situation in which sales are lost, but explain how the policy, cost assumptions, and proofs can be altered for the case where excess demand is backordered. In the lost sales case, the optimal policy will have one of three possible forms: a base stock policy for purchasing exclusively at the high variable cost (HVC) supplier; an (sLVC, SLVC) policy for buying exclusively from the low variable cost (LVC) supplier; or a hybrid (s, SHVC, SLVC) policy for buying from both suppliers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0229","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Participants in our model are time sensitive, with the same discount factor; potential buyers have unit demand and arrive sequentially according to a renewal process; and valuations are drawn independently from the same regular distribution. Invoking the revelation principle, we restrict our attention to direct dynamic mechanisms taking a sequence of valuations and arrival epochs as input. We define two properties (discreteness and stability), and prove under further distributional assumptions that we may at no cost of generality consider only mechanisms satisfying them. This effectively reduces the mechanism input to a sequence of valuations and leads to formulate the problem as a dynamic program (DP). As this DP is equivalent to a well-known infinite-horizon asset-selling problem, we finally characterize the optimal mechanism as a sequence of posted prices increasing with each sale. Remarkably, this result rationalizes somewhat the frequent restriction to dynamic pricing policies and impatient buyers assumption. Our numerical study indicates that, under various valuation distributions, the benefit of dynamic pricing over a fixed posted price may be small. Besides, posted prices are preferable to online auctions for a large number of items or high interest rate, but in other cases auctions are close to optimal and significantly more robust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0239","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mechanism design and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper suggests a method for the exact simulation of the stock price and variance under Heston\u2019s stochastic volatility model and other affine jump diffusion processes. The sample stock price and variance from the exact distribution can then be used to generate an unbiased estimator of the price of a derivative security.

Specifically, our method achieves an O(s-1/2) convergence rate, where s is the total computational budget.

We assume that the network operator must make investment decisions over a multiperiod planning horizon while facing rapid changes in transmission technology, as evidenced by a steadily decreasing per-unit cost of capacity. We deviate from traditional and monopolistic models in which demands are given as input parameters, and the objective is to minimize capacity deployment costs. Instead, we assume that the carrier sets end-to-end prices of bandwidth at each period of the planning horizon. These prices determine the demands that are to be met, using a plausible and explicit price-demand relationship; the resulting demands must then be routed, requiring an investment in capacity. The objective of the optimization is now to simultaneously select end-to-end prices of bandwidth and network capacities at each period of the planning horizon, so as to maximize the overall net present value of expanding and operating the network. In the case of typical large-scale optical networks with protection requirements, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges to standard optimization techniques. The complexity of the model, its nonlinear nature, and the large size of realistic problem instances motivates the development of efficient and scalable solution techniques. We show that while general-purpose nonlinear solvers are typically not adequate for the task, a specialized decomposition scheme is able to handle large-scale instances of this problem in reasonable time, producing solutions whose net present value is within a small tolerance of the optimum.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0259","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization models and investment decisions in network design without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

During radiation therapy, beams of radiation pass through a patient, killing both cancerous and normal cells. Thus, the radiation therapy must be carefully planned so that a clinically prescribed dose is delivered to targets containing cancerous cells, while nearby organs and tissues are spared. Currently, a technique called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer. In IMRT, the patient is irradiated from several beams, each of which is decomposed into hundreds of small beamlets, the intensities of which can be controlled individually. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a treatment plan for IMRT when the orientations of the beams are given. We propose a new model that has the potential to achieve most of the goals with respect to the quality of a treatment plan that have been considered to date. However, in contrast with established mixed-integer and nonlinear programming formulations, we do so while retaining linearity of the optimization problem, which substantially improves the tractability of the optimization problem. Furthermore, we discuss how several additional quality and practical aspects of the problem that have been ignored to date can be incorporated into our linear model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on clinical data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1050.0261","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to radiation therapy treatment planning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations related to healthcare practices.

A particularly important spatial requirement is the connectivity of selected sites. Direct connections between reserve sites increase the likelihood of species persistence by allowing dispersal and colonization of other areas within the network without species having to leave the reserve. The conventional set-covering and maximal-covering formulations of the reserve selection problem assume that species representation is the only criterion in site selection. This approach usually results in a small but highly fragmented reserve, which may not be desirable. We present a linear integer programming framework incorporating spatial contiguity as an additional site selection criterion. An empirical application to a data set on the occurrence of breeding birds in Berkshire, United Kingdom, demonstrates that site connectivity requires a significantly larger reserve. Incorporation of spatial criteria increases the computational complexity of the problem. To overcome this, we use a two-stage procedure where the original sites are aggregated first and an optimum solution is determined for the aggregate sites. Then, site selection is restricted to original sites included in the aggregate solution and a connected reserve is determined. In this particular application the above procedure generated a significantly more efficient reserve than a heuristic selection.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0272","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['conservation', 'connectivity', 'species persistence']","The article discusses conservation and the importance of connectivity in reserve design, which aligns with environmental sustainability themes.

The actual processing times are not known until processing is completed. We analyze the performance of the on-line nonpreemptive weighted shortest expected processing time among available jobs (WSEPTA) heuristic. When a scheduling decision needs to be made, this heuristic assigns, among the jobs that have arrived but not yet processed, one with the largest ratio of its weight to its expected processing time. We prove that when the job weights and processing times are bounded and job processing times are mutually independent random variables, WSEPTA is asymptotically optimal for the single-machine problem. This implies that WSEPTA generates a solution whose relative error approaches zero as the number of jobs increases.

We study the use of two types of dual-optimal inequalities to accelerate and stabilize the whole convergence process. Added to the dual formulation, these constraints are satisfied by all or a subset of the dual-optimal solutions. Therefore, the optimal objective function value of the augmented dual problem is identical to the original one. Adding constraints to the dual problem leads to adding columns to the primal problem, and feasibility of the solution may be lost. We propose two methods for recovering primal feasibility and optimality, depending on the type of inequalities that are used.

The supply chain consists of multiple overseas plants and a domestic distribution center (DC). Retail orders are first processed at the plants and then shipped from the plants to the DC for distribution to domestic retailers. Due to variations in productivity and labor costs at different plants, the processing time and cost of an order are dependent on the plant to which it is assigned. We study the following static and deterministic order assignment and scheduling problem faced by the manufacturer before every selling season: Given a set of orders, determine which orders are to be assigned to each plant, find a schedule for processing the assigned orders at each plant, and find a schedule for shipping the completed orders from each plant to the DC, such that a certain performance measure is optimized. We consider four different performance measures, all of which take into account both delivery lead time and the total production and distribution cost. A problem corresponding to each performance measure is studied separately. We analyze the computational complexity of various cases of the problems by either proving that a problem is intractable or providing an efficient exact algorithm for the problem. We propose several fast heuristics for the intractable problems. We analyze the worst-case and asymptotic performance of the heuristics and also computationally evaluate their performance using randomly generated test instances.

This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0283","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for solving a transportation problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition to traditional forward material flows, used products are returned to a recovery facility, where they can be stored, disposed, or remanufactured and shipped to one of the stages to re-enter the forward flow of material. This system combines the key elements of two simpler systems: the series system studied by Clark and Scarf (1960) and the single-stage remanufacturing systems studied by Simpson (1978) and Inderfurth (1997). We focus on identifying the structure of the optimal remanufacturing/ordering/disposal policy for such a system. In particular, we investigate whether the optimal policy inherits the basic structural properties of the simpler systems. We show that if remanufactured items flow into the most upstream stage, then this is the case. Specifically, the system can be solved by decomposition into a sequence of single-stage systems, with each downstream stage following an echelon base-stock policy and the most upstream stage following a three-parameter policy with a simple (and intuitive) structure. We show that similar results hold when remanufactured products flow into a downstream stage; however, in this case some modifications must be made. In particular, the definition of echelon inventory must be adjusted for stages upstream of the remanufacturing stage, and disposal of used items can no longer be allowed. We also compare the information required for managing this system to that required in the Clark and Scarf or Inderfurth settings, and we point out how the requirements are somewhat different depending on whether remanufacturing occurs upstream or downstream.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0290","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['remanufacturing', 'sustainability', 'disposal']","The article discusses remanufacturing and disposal within an inventory system, which touches on sustainability themes.

A family is a subset of the items that share a common family setup with its associated setup cost and setup time. Each item within the family may have its own setup time and setup cost. The families form a partition of the set of items manufactured on a single facility. The safety stock level for any item is a function of the time interval between production runs for the item, the service level specified, and the variance of its demand. We consider safety stocks explicitly in the formulation, as their holding costs vary nontrivially with the model\u2019s decision variables. The MFELSP-SS differs from multilevel inventory models with family setups in that the former assumes noninstantaneous inventory replenishment and considers the cost of holding safety stocks; the latter assumes instantaneous replenishment and does not directly assess the impact of safety stock levels on the total cost. An efficient solution procedure is developed for this model. Properties of the nonconvex feasible space are identified and used in the solution approach. The solution to the mathematical model comprises the basic period length, the family multipliers, and the item multipliers that give the lowest total cost of setups and carrying inventory. The family multipliers and item multipliers are restricted to integer powers of two.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0297","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2006","54","3","Wei-Min LanWei-Min Lanweimin@ethome.net.twIndustrial and Operations Engineering Department, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2117Search for more papers by this author, Tava Lennon OlsenTava Lennon Olsenolsen@olin.wustl.eduJohn M.

More specifically, we analyze the following single-item, periodic-review model. Demands in consecutive periods are independent random variables and their distributions are price sensitive. The production yield is uncertain so that the quantity received from a replenishment is a random variable whose distribution depends on the production quantity. Stockouts are fully backlogged. Our problem is to characterize the optimal dynamic policy that simultaneously determines the production quantity and the price for each period to maximize the total discounted profit. We show that the optimal replenishment policy is of a threshold type, i.e., it is optimal to produce if and only if the starting inventory in a period is below a threshold value, and that both the optimal production quantity and the optimal price in each period are decreasing in the starting inventory. We further study the operational effects of uncertain yield. We prove that, in the single-period case, the threshold of replenishment is independent of the yield variability, and, in the multiperiod case, it is higher in a system with uncertain yield than in one with certain yield. In addition, the system with uncertain yield always charges a higher price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0273","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Our motivation is to ease model development and maintenance by a solution method that links separately developed regional models only when a consistent multiregion solution is desired. A heuristic strategy is described to extend any existing (LP) decomposition principle to a procedure for decomposing an equilibrium model by region. This strategy is applied to extend Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to the multiregional economic equilibrium model, and several theoretical results are derived for the resulting algorithm. The central result is a proof of asymptotic convergence, under usefully general conditions. The extended Dantzig-Wolfe procedure is illustrated with an existing, two-region model of Canadian energy supplies and demands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0274","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for economic modeling without any reference to social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we propose and analyze computationally an automatic problem reformulation of quite general applicability, aimed at removing the model dependency on the big-M coefficients. Our solution scheme defines a master integer linear problem (ILP) with no continuous variables, which contains combinatorial information on the feasible integer variable combinations that can be \u201cdistilled\u201d from the original MIP model. The master solutions are sent to a slave linear program (LP), which validates them and possibly returns combinatorial inequalities to be added to the current master ILP. The inequalities are associated to minimal (or irreducible) infeasible subsystems of a certain linear system, and can be separated efficiently in case the master solution is integer. The overall solution mechanism closely resembles the Benders' one, but the cuts we produce are purely combinatorial and do not depend on the big-M values used in the MIP formulation. This produces an LP relaxation of the master problem which can be considerably tighter than the one associated with original MIP formulation. Computational results on two specific classes of hard-to-solve MIPs indicate that the new method produces a reformulation which can be solved some orders of magnitude faster than the original MIP model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0286","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mixed-integer programming without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Its usefulness as a demand model has also been recognized in production, inventory, and capacity-planning settings. The BM postulates that the cumulative number of adopters of a new product in a large population approximately follows a deterministic trajectory whose growth rate is governed by two parameters that capture (i) an individual consumer's intrinsic interest in the product, and (ii) a positive force of influence on other consumers from existing adopters. A finite-population pure-birth-process (re)formulation of the BM, called the Stochastic Bass Model (SBM), was proposed recently by the author in a previous paper, and it was shown that if the size of the population in the SBM is taken to infinity, then the SBM and the BM agree (in probability) in the limit. Thus, the SBM \u201cexpands\u201d the BM in the sense that for any given population size, it is a well-defined model. In this paper, we exploit this expansion and introduce a further extension of the SBM in which demands of a product in successive time periods are governed by a history-dependent family of SBMs (one for each period) with different population sizes. A sampling theory for this extension, which we call the Piecewise-Diffusion Model (PDM), is also developed. We then apply the theory to a typical product example, demonstrating that the PDM is a remarkably accurate and versatile framework that allows us to better understand the underlying dynamics of new-product demands over time. Joint movement of price and advertising levels, in particular, is shown to have a significant influence on whether or not consumers are \u201cready\u201d to participate in product purchase.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0287","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for understanding new-product demands without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition, to support delay-sensitive applications (e.g., streaming and multimedia applications) it is important for IBPs to maintain high service quality even if the network is congested. One promising approach is to establish interconnection agreements among providers to dynamically trade network capacity. To make such interconnections possible in a competitive setting, we propose a pricing scheme that considers factors such as network utilization, link capacity, and the cost structure of the interconnecting participants. Our analyses show that the common sender keeps all (SKA) mode of settlement does not provide adequate incentives for collaboration; rather, the provider that delivers the packets should be suitably compensated at an equilibrium price. Two price equilibria are identified: The first favors slower IBPs, whereas the other is congestion based and can be more beneficial for faster IBPs. When cost asymmetries exist, the lower cost IBP needs to offer a price discount to induce participation. We show that a usage-based, utilization-adjusted interconnection agreement could align the costs and revenues of the providers while allowing them to meet more stringent quality of service requirements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0288","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of interconnection arrangements among Internet backbone providers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is particularly useful when no a priori information is available on the trade-offs or relationships among various performance measures. A shortcoming of the DEA model, however, is its inability to provide a measure of absolute performance for the DMUs under investigation. Traditionally, in the service sector, this has not been an issue that one could address, because performance standards in that sector have been difficult to establish. However, in those settings where it has become feasible to develop such standards, it is desirable to build these into DEA performance evaluation, thereby enhancing the capability of the tool. While there have been some attempts to incorporate standards into the DEA structure, these approaches have generally been indirect, in the sense that they have focused primarily on restricting the DEA dual multipliers. This paper introduces a new way of building performance standards into the model. Utilizing the conventional DEA framework and a set of activity matrices, a set of standard DMUs can be generated and incorporated directly into the analysis. We show that under normal circumstances, these generated DMUs are efficient relative to the normal ones, and therefore form a type of outer frontier against which regular units can be evaluated. The proposed approach is applied to a sample of 100 branches of a major Canadian bank, where time standards are used to generate a set of standard bank branches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0295","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to performance measurement in decision-making units without addressing any social themes or ethical considerations.

The open shop problem is shown to be polynomially solvable for quite general functions defining the length of the maintenance intervals. By contrast, the flow shop problem is proved binary NP-hard and pseudopolynomially solvable by dynamic programming. We also present a fully polynomial approximation scheme and a fast 3/2-approximation algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0301","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and maintenance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The component inventories are either controlled by the continuous-time base-stock policies, namely, a base-stock ATO system, or by the continuous-time batch-ordering policies, namely, a batch-ordering ATO system. This paper develops the following results: First, for a base-stock ATO system with a single end product and renewal demand arrivals, we characterize the probability distribution of the delivery lead time, i.e., the time it takes to satisfy a demand. The exact analysis allows us to provide simple proofs for the important system properties. Second, for a base-stock ATO system with multiple end products and demand following independent Poisson processes, we characterize the dependence among the stockout delays of the components. We show that a multiproduct ATO system can be decomposed into multiple single-product subsystems with each subsystem corresponding to one product. The analysis allows us to develop two numerical methods to evaluate the performance of the base-stock ATO systems of medium to large sizes. A hypothetical example inspired by a real-world problem is presented. Third, for a batch-ordering ATO system, we develop efficient numerical methods for performance evaluation based on Monte Carlo simulation. Given the sample size, the number of products, and the reorder points, the computational complexity of the methods is no more than that of sorting a set of real numbers, where the set size equals to the sum of the batch sizes of all components. Finally, we characterize the impact of the dependence among the components on various ATO systems, and discuss the limits of the approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0302","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical analysis and performance evaluation of assemble-to-order systems without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

However, an abrupt migration of resources (transmitters and frequencies) from analog to digital networks cannot be accomplished because the analog services must be preserved temporarily. Hence, a multiobjective problem arises, in which several networks sharing a common set of resources have to be designed. This problem is referred to as the network packing problem. In Italy, this problem is particularly challenging because of a large number of transmitters, orographical features, and strict requirements imposed by Italian law. In this paper, we report our experience in developing solution methods at the major Italian broadcaster Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI S.p.A.). We propose a two-stage heuristic. In the first stage, emission powers are assigned to each network separately. In the second stage, frequencies are assigned to all networks so as to minimize the loss from mutual interference.

Viewed as a modified network, a CoC network is a spanning tree where the nodes in the modified network are themselves maximal bipartite subgraphs in the original network. We first present algorithms to identify these networks and then present a single-state-variable dynamic program for optimizing safety stock levels and locations. We next present two reformulations of the dynamic program that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving the optimality of the resulting solution. This work both incorporates arbitrary safety stock cost functions and makes possible optimizing a large class of practically useful but previously intractable networks.

Models for PLFs use continuous variables in special-ordered sets of type 2 (SOS2). Traditionally, SOS2 constraints are enforced by introducing auxiliary binary variables and other linear constraints on them. Alternatively, we can enforce SOS2 constraints by branching on them, thus dispensing with auxiliary binary variables. We explore this approach further by studying the inequality description of the convex hull of the feasible set of LPs with PLFs in the space of the continuous variables, and using the new cuts in a branch-and-cut scheme without auxiliary binary variables. We give two families of valid inequalities. The first family is obtained by lifting the convexity constraints. The second family consists of lifted cover inequalities. Finally, we report computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our cuts, and that branch-and-cut without auxiliary binary variables is significantly more practical than the traditional mixed-integer programming approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0277","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for optimization without addressing any social or ethical themes.

The resulting long-term contract demand is a deterministic fluid, while the spot-market demand is modeled as a stochastic renewal process. An exponential reflected random walk model is used to model the spot-market price, which is correlated with the spot-market demand process. The manufacturer accepts or rejects each electronic order, and long-term contracts and accepted electronic orders are backordered if necessary. The manufacturer\u2019s control problem is to select the optimal long-term contract price as well as the optimal production (i.e., busy/idle) and electronic-order admission policies to maximize revenue minus inventory holding and backorder costs.

If an airline decides how many seats to protect for sale at a high fare based on past high-fare sales, while neglecting to account for the fact that availability of low-fare tickets will reduce high-fare sales, then high-fare sales will decrease, resulting in lower future estimates of high-fare demand. This subsequently yields lower protection levels for high-fare tickets, greater availability of low-fare tickets, and even lower high-fare ticket sales. The pattern continues, resulting in a so-called spiral down.

Using a deterministic and continuous (fluid model) relaxation of this problem, which can be justified asymptotically as the capacity and the potential demand grow large, we show the following: (i) greedy sequencing (i.e., the c\u03bc-rule) is optimal, (ii) the optimal pricing and sequencing decisions decouple in finite time, after which (iii) the system evolution and thus the optimal prices depend only on the total workload. Building on (i)\u2013(iii), we propose a one-dimensional workload relaxation to the fluid pricing problem that is simpler to analyze, and leads to intuitive and implementable pricing heuristics.

More specifically, each customer order entails a due date specifying when the customer wants the item delivered. The information is perfect in the sense that a placed order cannot be revised. With the intent of using the advance-order information fully throughout the supply chain, each installation replenishes its stock using order base-stock policies (see Hariharan and Zipkin 1995). As for stock allocation, the presence of advance-order information at the central warehouse raises important questions regarding when reservations should be made for different retailers, i.e., how to make best use of the available temporal information to allocate items to retailers. Exact and approximate cost evaluation techniques are presented for the general case, the general reservation policy, as well as for the two special cases of reserving as early as possible, the complete reservation policy, and as late as possible, the last-minute allocation policy. A numerical study illustrates the performance of the proposed heuristics and provides insights on the value of using advance-order information in supply chain inventory control.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0319","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using this method, we identify two general categories of anticancer drug protocols, depending on the temporal cycle parameters of the host and cancer cells: a one-time intensive treatment, or a series of nonintensive treatments. Our method is based on a theoretical and experimental work showing that treatment efficacy can be improved by determining the dosing frequency on the drug-susceptible target and host cell-cycle parameters. Simulating the patient's pharmaco-dynamics in a simple model for cell population growth, we calculate the number of drug susceptible cells at every moment of therapy. Local search heuristics are then used to conduct a search for the desired solution, as defined by our criteria. These criteria include the patient's state at the end of a predetermined time period, the number of cancer and host cells at the end of treatment, and the time to the patient's cure. The process suggested here does not depend on the exact biological assumptions of the model, thus enabling its use in a more complex description of the system. We test three solution methods. Simulated annealing is compared to threshold acceptance and old bachelor acceptance, which are less known variants to this method. The conclusions concerning the three approximation methods are that good results can be achieved by choosing the proper parameters for each of the methods, but the computational effort required for achieving good results is much greater in simulated annealing than in the other methods. Also, a large number of iterations does not guarantee better solution quality, and resources would be better used in several short searches with different parameter values than in one long search.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0320","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for optimizing chemotherapy scheduling without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

The resulting nonlinear, nonlocal hyperbolic conservation law allows fast and accurate simulations. Little's law is built into the model. It is argued that the state equation for a re-entrant factory should be nonlinear. Comparisons of simulations of the partial differential equation (PDE) model and discrete-event simulations are presented. A general analysis of the model shows that for any nonlinear state equation there exist two steady states of production below a critical start rate: A high-volume, high-throughput time state and a low-volume, low-throughput time state. The stability of the low-volume state is proved. Output is controlled by adjusting the start rate to a changed demand rate. Two linear factories and a re-entrant factory, each one modeled by a hyperbolic conservation law, are linked to provide proof of concept for efficient supply chain simulations.

In addition to evaluating traditional departments and schools, the methodology is designed to evaluate interdisciplinary programs or fields that typically span many areas of a university, such as operations research, risk analysis, and decision science. We first discuss general principles of using this methodology for the evaluation of disciplinary or interdisciplinary academic programs. Next, we apply this methodology to interdisciplinary graduate decision science programs in United States universities, focusing on both prescriptive decision analysis and descriptive decision research. Finally, we suggest how the methodology might be implemented to evaluate operations research programs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0328","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a decision analysis methodology for evaluating academic programs without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This travel-time function integrates the traffic dynamics as well as the effects of shocks. Numerical examples demonstrate the quality of the analytical function, in comparison with simulated travel times.

The n products are perfectly complementary in the sense that they are always sold and consumed jointly or in sets of one unit of each. Demand for the products during a selling season is both price sensitive and uncertain. Each of the n manufacturers faces the problem of choosing a production quantity and a selling price for his product. Two settings are considered, regarding the decision sequence of the n manufacturers: They are either simultaneous or sequential. The retailer, when present, employs a consignment-sales contract with revenue sharing to bind her relationship with the manufacturers and to extract profit for herself. Using a multiplicative demand model in this paper, we fully characterize individual firms\u2019 decisions in equilibria, under each of the two game settings, and derive closed-form performance measures, both for the channel and for individual channel members.

This paper focuses on an application of operations research techniques at the USCG to improve the performance of its aircraft service parts supply chain. We focused on evaluating the supply chain benefits from linking the aircraft maintenance database with the aircraft parts inventory database. This required us to (a) develop an approach to link the databases and (b) use aircraft maintenance information to improve the inventory management of service parts at the USCG. We first used mathematical programming tools to merge the maintenance database with the demand database. We then developed state-dependent supply replenishment policies that use part-age information to manage the service parts supply chain. We show that one of the proposed policies permits analytic estimation of the benefits of linking the data sets. The impact of these inventory policies was evaluated using empirical demand data for 41 critical parts over a five-year period. Computational results suggest that our proposed policies can lead to significant reductions in inventory cost over the current system, as high as 70% for some parts.

This provides consumers with some level of comfort in their purchase decision. A similar low-price guarantee is provided by numerous service industries that allow reservation of capacity, yet do not penalize the consumer for failure to keep that reservation\u2014examples include hotels and car rental. Given that a consumer is not required to keep the reservation, they may make another reservation, either at a competing firm or the same firm, if future prices decline. The increasing availability of pricing information on the Internet affords consumers the opportunity to be more strategic in their purchasing behavior. As consumers, we are able to quickly and easily check prices from numerous service or goods providers. The ease of price information potentially makes these guarantees very costly to the service or good provider. We analyze the implied costs associated with these guarantees by making analogies to financial options. Motivation for this research comes from a large car rental firm, Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc., that considered offering a low-price guarantee to all consumers that book a reservation though their website.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0333","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of low-price guarantees in retail and service industries without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To enhance QMC algorithms, dimension reduction techniques, such as the Brownian bridge (BB) and principal component analysis (PCA), are used to reduce the effective dimension. This paper explores in depth the effects of these techniques on the dimension structure of some typical high-dimensional problems from finance: the pricing of path-dependent options and bond valuation according to term structure models. By deriving explicit expressions for the underlying integrands and the associated weights that control the relative importance of different variables, and by investigating the variance ratios, the effective dimensions, the mean dimension, and their limiting behavior as the nominal dimension tends to infinity, we show theoretically and empirically how and to what extent the BB and PCA algorithms change the dimension structure (including the degree of additivity) of the underlying functions. They change the functions to be strongly weighted and substantially reduce the effective dimensions and the mean dimension; and they enhance the degree of additivity, which is particularly important for QMC. Moreover, the resulting functions are of low effective dimension, not only in the superposition sense, but also in the truncation sense. The variance ratios, the effective dimensions, and the mean dimension associated with these techniques are very insensitive to the nominal dimension (they are essentially constant), which highlights the possibility of removing the curse of dimensionality when dimension reduction techniques are used in combination with QMC. A counterexample is also shown for which the BB and PCA may increase the effective dimension. The investigation provides further insight into the effects of dimension reduction techniques.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0334","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of finance and mathematical techniques without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We present profit-maximization models that make optimal inventory and production decisions in the above assemble-to-order environment.

We find a closed-form optimal pricing policy, which utilizes current demand information. Under this pricing policy the inventory trajectory is deterministic, and a retailer sells all inventory. We show that dynamic pricing coordinated with the inventory decision achieves significantly higher profits than does static pricing. Furthermore, under oligopolistic competition we establish a weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium for the price and inventory replenishment game. We find the pricing equilibrium to be cooperative even in a noncooperative environment, but that inventory competition results in overstock and damages profits. Finally, we examine the trade-off between dynamic pricing and price precommitment and find that flexible pricing is still beneficial, provided competition is not too intense.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0336","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of revenue management and pricing strategies without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this paper, I propose that common portrayals of temporary organizations as ephemeral and unstable are inaccurate: Temporary organizations are in fact organized around structured role systems whose nuances are negotiated in situ. This paper analyzes one type of temporary organization, film projects, exploring the way in which roles both organize immediate work and maintain continuity across different projects. On each film set, role expectations are communicated through practices of enthusiastic thanking, polite admonishing, and role-oriented joking, which enable crew members to learn and negotiate role structures. Two important structural characteristics of film projects provide the organizational context within which coordination takes place: interorganizational career progression and projects as temporary total institutions. By showing how these structural elements and role enactments support one another, this work generates a more complete understanding of the conditions that affect coordination, including role duration, expectations of future interaction, and visibility of work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0149","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['temporary organizations', 'role systems', 'coordination']","The article primarily focuses on the structural and organizational aspects of temporary organizations in the film industry, with no explicit emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The Case of Computer-Controlled Music Instruments","Studies of the sources of innovations have recognized that many innovations are developed by users. However, the fact that firms employ communities of users to strengthen their innovation process has not yet received much attention. In online firm-hosted user communities, users freely reveal innovations to a firm's product platform, which can put the firm in a favorable position (a) because these new product features become available to all users through sharing on a user-to-user basis, or (b) because it allows the firm to pick up the innovations and integrate them in future products and then benefit by selling them to all users. We study the key personal attributes of the individuals responsible for innovations, namely the innovative users, to explain creation of value in this organizational context. The main question is why such users contribute to firm-hosted user communities. Analyzing data derived from multiple sources (interviews, a Web-log, and questionnaires), we find that innovative users are likely to be (i) hobbyists, an attribute that can be assumed to (positively) affect innovators' willingness to share innovations, and (ii) responsive to \u201cfirm recognition\u201d as a motivating factor for undertaking innovation, which explains their decision to join the firm's domain. In agreement with earlier studies, we also find that innovative users are likely to be \u201clead users,\u201d an attribute that we assume to affect the quality of user innovation. Whether or not a firm-hosted user community can be turned into an asset for the firm is to a great extent conditional on the issues studied in this paper.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0156","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'community', 'users']","The article focuses primarily on user innovation and firm-hosted communities without addressing social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Drawing on the notion of a \u201ctrading zone,\u201d we suggest that by engaging in these practices, members enact a coordination structure that affords cross-boundary coordination while facilitating adaptability, speed, and learning. We also find that these coordination practices do not eliminate jurisdictional conflicts, and often generate problematic consequences such as the privileging of speed over quality, suppression of difference, loss of comprehension, misinterpretation and ambiguity, rework, and temporal pressure. After discussing our empirical findings, we explore their implications for organizations attempting to operate in the uncertain and rapidly changing contexts of postbureaucratic work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0157","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['coordination', 'communities', 'adaptability', 'difference', 'jurisdictional conflicts']","The article discusses cross-boundary coordination practices and their implications for organizations, indicating a moderate focus on inclusivity and adaptability in diverse work environments.

External social network ties were based on the friendship ties among all 88 of the division's sales group leaders and the 10 high-ranking supervisors to whom they reported. Internal social network ties consisted of 28 separate networks, each representing the set of friendship relations among all members of a given sales group. Objective group performance data came directly from company records. Data on each group leader's personal reputation for leadership was based on the perceptions of three different constituencies: subordinates, peers, and supervisors. Results revealed that leaders' centrality in external and internal friendship networks was related both to objective measures of group performance and to their reputation for leadership among different organizational constituencies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0158","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['leadership', 'performance', 'reputation']","The article focuses on leadership and performance metrics without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, threat perception can then trigger a response that accentuates organizational rigidity. This cognitive paradox is explored using a multilevel, longitudinal case study of a newspaper organization\u2019s response to digital publishing. The results suggest that the competing frames of threat and opportunity can coexist within the firm when it creates organizationally differentiated subunits. Such a structure minimizes the need to integrate competing frames at the subunit level, enabling different behaviors to be enacted simultaneously across different units of the firm. This differentiated organizational form places an increased burden on senior teams that have to manage the inconsistencies across subunits. Insight into the structure of competing frames has broader implications for the structure of dynamic capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0160","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","[]","The article primarily focuses on organizational behavior and cognitive frameworks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The concept is proposed to fill a gap in studies of social context. Scholars tend only to infer, not identify, the people an individual is aware of at work. This surmise creates no problem in groups or small organizations where everyone knows everyone else. However, it becomes troublesome in large organizations where the set of people one individual discerns may vary considerably from that of another. Social network studies of large organizations examine people an individual perceives, but focus on interpersonal communication through salient relationships. They tend to neglect the many distant others who populate an individual's social context: those known only through company newsletters or office gossip, those with whom the individual never has contact, and those who carry little immediate salience. Data from a large organization are used to explore whether organizational reference groups provide distinct, useful information about individuals' perceptions of their social context at work. The findings replicate those showing individuals' preferences for similar others, but also note previously unobserved systematic differences in the composition of close associations compared to the broader ones of organizational reference groups. Distant associations are considerably more homogeneous than close ones. Moreover, the results show that organizational reference groups illuminate career referent selection and expected achievement beyond what would be learned from a typical social network analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0173","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['social context', 'perceptions', 'homogeneous', 'associations']","The article discusses the concept of organizational reference groups and their impact on individuals' perceptions within the workplace, highlighting social context and diversity in associations.

We argue that market-level turnover events generate and release vicarious information that small multiunit organizations can use to enhance their likelihood of survival. We focus on two specific turnover events, ownership transfers and contemporaneous exit-entry pairs (cases in which both outlet entry and outlet exit occur within the same market within the same time period), because these events are likely to generate and release information without altering the total number of outlets in a market. We find that the likelihood of a multiunit owner's outlet exit declines when there are many ownership transfers and exit-entry pairs in other markets where the owner also operates outlets. We conclude that these turnover events, even in just one market where a small multiunit organization is present, generate vicarious information substantial enough to increase the survival likelihood of all outlets of that multiunit organization. Our theory and supporting results show how organizational learning-based arguments can be combined with our knowledge of multiunit organizations to build a theory of relationships between geographically separated turnover events.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0174","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational learning', 'market-level turnover', 'survival likelihood']","The article focuses on organizational learning and market dynamics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, which are central to 'woke' themes.

On the one hand, good reputation could be a disadvantage because expectations about product quality are more likely to be violated by defects in highly reputed products. On the other hand, a good reputation could be an advantage because of strong inertial effects on reputation orderings. We empirically test these competing hypotheses using data on product recalls in the U.S. automobile industry from 1975 to 1999. Our results support for the idea that reputation can be an organizational liability in that highly reputed firms suffer more market penalty as a result of their product recalls. We also propose that the reputational effects are moderated by two important factors: substitutability and generalism/specialism. Our results show that having few substitutes with an equivalent level of reputation, or a focused product identity stemming from specialism, buffers the negative market reactions to product recalls. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of these results for institutional, reputation, and status theories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0175","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['reputation', 'product recalls', 'market reactions']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of reputation and market reactions related to product recalls, with no explicit mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Drawing from process theory, narrative psychology, and practice approaches to identity, I outline a perspective on organizational becoming as dialogic imagination of practice. Conceived as such, authoring takes place as a continuous stream of suggestions of what practice is, has been, and could be, simultaneously addressing life enrichment and organizational development. Three forms of imagination of practice are identified as central in the development of the case organization: (1) the instantiating of project experiences as identity exemplars; (2) a powerful dramatizing of trajectories of practice, exemplified by use of the metaphor of the \u201cIndomitable Gauls;\u201d and (3) a subsequent reframing instigated by discontinuous changes in dominant activity sets. The three authoring forms are discussed in relation to organizational development and adaptation. Implications include increased attention to forward-looking authoring motives and hope, a reformulation of the identity question from \u201cwho are we?\u201d to \u201cwhat are we doing?\u201d and a possible location of practices as belonging to stories beyond that of the organization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0176","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'organizational development', 'dialogic', 'practice', 'hope']","The article discusses themes of identity and organizational development, emphasizing a dialogic approach that reflects on the implications of practice and identity within organizations.

A firm can make or buy inputs, and transfer outputs downstream or sell them. Permeable vertical architectures are partly integrated and partly open to the markets along a firm\u2019s value chain. Increased permeability enables more effective use of resources and capacities, better matching of capabilities with market needs, and benchmarking to improve efficiency. Partial integration promotes a more dynamic, open innovation platform and enhances strategic capabilities by linking key parts of the value chain. This permeable vertical architecture, accompanied by appropriate transfer prices and incentive design, facilitates resource allocation and guides a firm\u2019s growth process. Our longitudinal study of a major European manufacturer suggests that to understand how firm boundaries are set and what their impacts are, we need to complement the microanalytic focus on transactions with a systemic analysis at the level of the firm.

However, the design process can have dramatic implications for how organizations function. This paper reports a specific attempt to design one organizational subunit, a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), to function under difficult circumstances. The founders aimed to create a highly reliable and safe unit, but implementing their vision required continuous effort. The unit needed constant buffering from external pressures and a dissimilar parent organization, and these forces shaped the unit\u2019s ultimate design. Through the presentation of this case, we discuss the impact of design on the organization, its members, and the larger hospital organization to which the unit belonged. The study reveals that the PICU\u2019s design was an ongoing effort and its most stable component was a vision of distributed knowledge and decentralized intensive care.

We also find that the arbitrariness surrounding corrupt transactions has a significant impact on firms\u2019 decisions, in addition to the overall level of corruption.

Overlap in owners, indirect equity holdings, and director interlocks are especially strong delineators of group boundaries. Family connections and direct equity holdings do not do as good a job of distinguishing group boundaries. These findings challenge the longstanding conventional wisdom among field-based scholars that family bonds are the defining feature of business groups in emerging markets. We speculate that family bonds are so durable that, over time, they come to pervade the entirety of an economy and lose their ability to distinguish business groups from the overall network of social and economic ties.

The first is the tendency of participant organizations to construct observed macrostructure locally, through relational activities that involve only a small subset of possible network ties. The second is the tendency for different types of ties to overlap, concatenate, and induce a variety of local structures\u2014or relational motifs\u2014across network domains. A critical task in the analysis of organizational communities is to specify appropriate local dependence structures across multiple networks, starting from detailed observation of dyadic interaction among participants. In this paper we illustrate one way in which this analytical task might be accomplished in the context of a study of interorganizational networks. We use data that we have collected on different types of relationships among 106 organizations, located in Southern Italy, involved in the production of means of transportation to test hypotheses about patterns of local network ties and paths across multiple networks. Our empirical analysis is guided by the general claim that the formation of network ties is subject to endogenous and exogenous processes. We specify statistical models for random graphs that allow us to examine this claim, and to formulate and test specific hypotheses about the form that such network-based processes might take. The results that we report provide clear empirical support for the relational motifs implied by our hypotheses. We also find strong empirical support for the proposition that interorganizational dependencies extend across multiple networks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0190","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational communities', 'network ties', 'interorganizational relations']","The article primarily focuses on empirical analysis of organizational structures and network ties without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Although insights from creativity research have been integrated into models of work design to increase the stimulants of creativity (e.g., intrinsic motivation), this has not led to work design models that have effectively reduced the obstacles to creativity (e.g., workload pressures). As a consequence, creative output among professionals in high-workload contexts remains disappointing. In response, we offer a framework of work design that focuses on the design of entire workdays rather than the typical focus on designing either specific tasks or very broad job descriptions (e.g., as the job characteristics model in Hackman et al. 1975). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of \u201cmindless\u201d work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) as an integral part of this framework. We suggest that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, workdays should be designed to alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging and high-pressure work (as suggested in the original model by Hackman et al. 1975), and bouts of mindless work (as defined in this paper). We discuss the implications of our framework for theories of work design and creativity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0193","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['creativity', 'work design', 'workload', 'mindless work']","The article discusses the design of workdays to enhance creativity and reduce workload pressures, which touches on themes of employee well-being and organizational ethics.

Literature on supplier relations suggests that suppliers are skeptical of close ties with their buyers (Helper 1991, Helper and Sako 1995). Such skepticism persists in spite of the fact that buyers are writing longer (enforceable) contracts with fewer suppliers. In this context, the paper develops a transaction cost economics (TCE)-based model that distinguishes between the verifiable and nonverifiable aspects of governance attributes (of safeguards, incentive intensity, and adaptability) in explaining supplier performance variations. The paper argues that the following factors prove valuable for suppliers: (1) the adaptive and collaborative orientation fostered by the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (OEM\u2019s) credible commitment to the exchange and by information sharing on the part of the supplier, (2) the presence of certain nonverifiable safeguards, and (3) the incentives inherent in target pricing. These assertions have been tested using data from the home appliance industry. Results indicate that information sharing together with (1) OEM dependence and (2) target pricing does indeed enhance supplier performance. Also, results suggest that while nonverifiable safeguards can help, verifiable safeguards do not have a positive association with supplier interests. Under certain conditions then, suppliers can venture into closer relationships with buyers and benefit.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0194","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['supplier performance', 'enforceable contracts', 'information sharing']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supplier performance and contract enforcement without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Whereas existing literature has emphasized the importance of communication, task design, and incentives for cooperation, this paper shows how status differentials and geographic distance reinforce each other to affect the work processes and collaboration in distributed teams. The focus is on two elements: the relationship between the collaboration across the two groups and their members and the members\u2019 interpretations of this relationship. Status influences the perceptions of the remote group, as well as the willingness to cooperate with its members. The key findings specify the informal closure strategies used by the high-status group in relation to the low-status group. Furthermore, the superimposition of geographic and status distance in remote work lowered the cost of exclusion of one group from the collaboration and led to the deepening of status differences between remote groups. By showing status to be both an input and an output of intergroup relations, the paper specifies some of the mechanisms through which status orderings are maintained and reinforced.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0195","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['status', 'collaboration', 'exclusion', 'geographic distance', 'intergroup relations']","The article examines the dynamics of status and exclusion in distributed teams, highlighting how geographic and status differences affect collaboration.

We add to Levinthal and Rerup\u2019s conjectures by examining Western and Eastern versions of mindfulness and how they function as a process of knowing an object. In our expanded view, encoding becomes less central. What becomes more central are activities such as altering the codes, differentiating the codes, introspecting the coding process itself, and, most of all, reducing the overall dependence on coding and codes. Consequently, we shift from Levinthal and Rerup\u2019s contrast between mindful and less mindful to a contrast between conceptual and less conceptual.

The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archival data gathered in intensive field studies of work in professional service firms. The evidence suggests that although some creative solutions can be seen as the products of individual insight, others should be regarded as the products of a momentary collective process. Such collective creativity reflects a qualitative shift in the nature of the creative process, as the comprehension of a problematic situation and the generation of creative solutions draw from\u2014and reframe\u2014the past experiences of participants in ways that lead to new and valuable insights. This research investigates the origins of such moments, and builds a model of collective creativity that identifies the precipitating roles played by four types of social interaction: help seeking, help giving, reflective reframing, and reinforcing. Implications of this research include shifting the emphasis in research and management of creativity from identifying and managing creative individuals to understanding the social context and developing interactive approaches to creativity, and from a focus on relatively constant contextual variables to the alignment of fluctuating variables and their precipitation of momentary phenomena.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0200","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['collective creativity', 'social interaction', 'reflective reframing', 'help seeking', 'help giving']","The article discusses the shift from individual creativity to collective processes, emphasizing social interactions and the importance of context in problem-solving.

Moreover, it appears that CEOs use their own power not only to increase their own salaries, but also those of their subordinates. One implication of such a process may be that the overpayment of a top executive has higher costs than have previously been realized. We also find evidence suggesting that CEOs serve as a key referent for employees in determining whether their own situation is \u201cfair,\u201d and this influences their reactions to their own compensation. More specifically, we find that when lower-level managers are underpaid relative to the CEO\u2014that is, underpaid more than the CEO or overpaid less\u2014they are more likely to leave the organization. Results obtained from testing our hypotheses on a sample of more than 120 firms over a five-year period demonstrates the importance of considering fairness in the setting of CEO pay. Implications for the design of executive compensation packages are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0204","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['fairness', 'underpaid', 'executive compensation']","The article discusses the concept of fairness in executive compensation, highlighting the implications of pay disparities between CEOs and lower-level managers.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the productivity of corporate scientists of acquired companies is generally impaired by integration, but that some scientists experience more disruption than others. In particular, acquisition integration will be most disruptive, leading to the most severe productivity drops, for those inventors who have lost the most social status and centrality in the combined entity. Drawing from prior literatures on the knowledge-based view of the firm, and on mergers and acquisitions, we develop hypotheses about a concise set of conditions that will lead to substantial performance drops for acquired technical personnel.

Second, we build on the idea that legitimated forms codify prescriptive sanctions for deviations from identity blueprints, and predict that when an emergent population overlaps with an established one in identity space, its early proliferation will manifest violations of established social identities and will trigger prescriptive sanctions.

Questions arise: How should organizations, with their complex processes and human involvement, be designed if they are to perform well in such crises? Would organizations benefit from structural changes during crises? From a neo-information processing perspective that views organizations as composed of cognitively restricted, socially situated, and task-oriented actors, we argue that the causes and consequences of crises may be better understood through the systematic examination of both environmental and organizational factors. We address our research questions using a rather unique approach: a matched analysis of 80 real organizational cases and 80 computer-simulated organizations. The findings show that a crisis can present critical challenges to organizational performance both externally and internally, and that there is no design guarantee that a high-performing organization will continue to perform well during a crisis situation. In addition, when organizations restructure to adapt to crisis situations, they often face the serious challenges of having to understand not only the external environment, but also organizational design traps.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0210","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['crises', 'organizational design', 'performance']","The article discusses organizational design in the context of crises, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

A suboptimal equifinality situation exists when organizations must satisfy multiple and conflicting functional demands with a restricted set of design options; these restrictions force all organizations to operate suboptimally. Gresov and Drazin (1997) speculate that in such a situation legitimacy claims are made about one function being more important than the other(s) so that an increased quantity of acceptable organizational forms are established. Additionally, they argue that a misfit penalty is likely to exist for organizations that deviate from the preferred configurational design. With data from the medical group industry, these speculations about suboptimal equifinality situations are tested using multivariate regression analyses. Findings show that the configuration type aligning with the preferred functional demand of quality performs relatively higher than those aligning with operational efficiency or attempting to meet both demands. Additionally, the greater the organization\u2019s deviation from that design, the lower the financial performance. In summary, this study demonstrates that it is useful to take a functional equivalence perspective when examining variance in firm performance that is caused by design differences. Such an approach allows a more complete understanding of the fit-performance relationship by explicitly considering three factors: (i) the number of and level of conflict(s) among functional demands placed on the organization, (ii) the structural design options available to the decision maker, and (iii) the trade-offs that exist.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0203","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational configurations', 'functional demands', 'suboptimal']","The article primarily focuses on organizational performance and configurations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a 10-year panel of data from the chemical industry, we find evidence consistent with the latter hypothesis for at least one prominent example of self-regulation.

We argue that, in early relationships, the level of expected cooperative norms in an exchange is the result of a calculative process facilitated by transaction attributes: joint transaction-specific investments and observability. The greater the level of these two exchange attributes, the greater the level of cooperative exchange norms, all else being equal. We further argue that the realized level of cooperative exchange norms can deviate from the expected level because the development of such norms is the result of social processes that management cannot directly and fully control. This gap between realized and expected norms affects exchange performance. Performance suffers when the realized level of cooperative exchange norms falls below the expected level, but overshooting expectations lays a critical groundwork for repeat transactions.

To address this discrepancy, we decompose the recruitment process into objective selection, subjective selection, and self-selection and theorize that the likelihood of passing a particular recruitment stage increases with the performance of the referrer under objective selection and self-selection, but remains undetermined at a stage of subjective selection. Our analysis of unique comprehensive data on online recruitment of sales agents in a virtual call center supports these arguments. The effectiveness of personnel as a recruitment channel varies with the type of the recruitment stage and performance of the referrer. When the firm evaluates candidates by an objective criterion, the advantage of a referral increases with the performance of his or her referrer; those referred by relatively high-performing workers are significantly better than the applicants who learned about the job from Internet ads. When job candidates self-select into the next stage of the online application process, the referral of any agent is more likely to continue than a nonreferral, and this likelihood increases with the performance of the referrer. On a subjective stage, the outcome is contingent on the intricacies of the recruitment process. In our case, an applicant\u2019s chances of being hired increase with the performance of his or her referrer because the firm rejects the referrals of low-performing workers at a higher rate than it does nonreferrals, while it treats equally the referrals of high-performing workers and nonreferrals.

We assume a periodic review model with stochastic demand, lost sales, and order quantity restrictions. The product lifetime is fixed and deterministic once received by the retailer, although the age of replenished items provided by the supplier varies stochastically over time. Since the product is perishable, any unsold inventory remaining after the lifetime elapses must be discarded (outdated). Without the supplier explicitly informing the retailer of the product age, the age remains unknown until receipt. With information sharing, the retailer is informed of the product age prior to placing an order and hence, can utilize this information in its decision\u2010making. We formulate the retailer's replenishment policies, with and without knowing the age of the product upon receipt, and measure the VOI as the marginal improvement in profit that the retailer achieves with information sharing, relative to the case when no information is shared.

This metric is defined to be the percentage of customers whose actual waiting time was less than their individual waiting time threshold. We label this metric the Percentage of Satisfied Customers (PSC.) This threshold is a reflection of the customers' expectation of a reasonable waiting time in the system given its current state. Cases in which no system state information is available to the customer are referred to as \u201chidden queues.\u201d For such systems, the waiting time threshold is independent of the length of the waiting line, and it is randomly drawn from a distribution of threshold values for the customer population. The literature generally assumes that such thresholds are exponentially distributed. For these cases, we derive closed form expressions for our performance metric for a variety of possible service time distributions. We also relax this assumption for cases where service times are exponential and derive closed form results for a large class of threshold distributions. We analyze such queues for both single and multi\u2010server systems. We refer to cases in which customers may observe the length of the line as \u201crevealed\u201d queues.\u201c We perform a parallel analysis for both single and multi\u2010server revealed queues. The chief distinction is that for these cases, customers may develop threshold values that are dependent upon the number of customers in the system upon their arrival. The new perspective this paper brings to the modeling of the performance of waiting line systems allows us to rethink and suggest ways to enhance the effectiveness of various managerial options for improving the service quality and customer satisfaction of waiting line systems. We conclude with many useful insights on ways to improve customer satisfaction in waiting line situations that follow directly from our analysis.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00033.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and customer satisfaction metrics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While investment decisions need to be made years before demand is realized, pricing decisions can easily be postponed until product launch, when more accurate demand information is available. We study the effect of this price decision delay on the optimal investments on dedicated and flexible capacity. Computational experiments show that considering price postponement at the planning stage leads to a large reduction in capacity investments, especially in the more expensive flexible capacity, and a significant increase in profits.

In both problems, the manufacturer focuses on minimizing unproductive time. The distributor minimizes customer cost measures in the first problem and minimizes inventory holding cost in the second problem. We first evaluate each party's conflict, which is the relative increase in cost that results from using the other party's optimal schedule. Since this conflict is often significant, we consider several practical scenarios about the level of cooperation between the manufacturer and the distributor. These scenarios define various scheduling problems for the manufacturer, the distributor, and the overall system. For each of these scheduling problems, we provide an algorithm. We demonstrate that the cost saving provided by cooperation between the decision makers is usually significant.

We present a \u201cUnified Services Theory\u201d (UST) to clearly delineate service processes from non\u2010service processes and to identify key commonalities across seemingly disparate service businesses.

Non\u2010services (such as make\u2010to\u2010stock manufacturing) rely on customer selection of outputs, payment for outputs, and occasional feedback, but production is not dependent upon inputs from individual customers. The UST reveals principles that are common to the wide range of services and provides a unifying foundation for various theories and models of service operations, such as the traditional \u201ccharacteristics of services\u201d and Customer Contact Theory. The UST has significant operational corollaries pertaining to capacity and demand management, service quality, services strategy, and so forth.

In this paper, we develop models to support a manufacturer's recovery strategy in the face of a competitive threat on the remanufactured product market. We first analyze the competition between new and remanufactured products produced by a monopolist manufacturer and identify conditions under which the firm would choose not to remanufacture its products. We then characterize the potential profit loss due to external remanufacturing competition and analyze two entry\u2010deterrent strategies: remanufacturing and preemptive collection.

We model the sale, return, refurbishment, and resale processes in an open queueing network and formulate a mathematical program to find the optimal price and proportion to refurbish. Examination of the optimality conditions reveals the different situations in which it is optimal to refurbish none, some, or all of the returned products.

In this paper, we examine the case of a remanufacturer who acquires unsorted used products as needed from third party brokers.

Thus, two related decisions are made: how many used items to acquire, and how selective to be during the sorting process. We derive optimal acquisition and sorting policies in the presence of used product condition variability for a remanufacturer facing both deterministic and uncertain demand.

When remanufacturing is feasible, the longer the return flows are delayed during the active (primary) market demand period of the product, the lower the value that can be recovered through these operations. In fact, in order to recover the highest value from remanufactured products, the collection rates, return timings, and reusability rates should be matched with the active market demand and supply. With these motivations, this paper is aimed at developing analytical models for the efficient use of returns in making production, inventory, and remanufacturing decisions during the active market. More specifically, we consider a stylistic setting where a collector collects used product returns and ships them to the manufacturer who, in turn, recovers value by remanufacturing and supplies products during the active market demand. Naturally, the manufacturer's production, inventory and remanufacturing decisions and costs are influenced by the timing and quantity of the collector's shipments of used product returns. Hence, we investigate the impact of the timing of returns on the profitability of the manufacturer\u2010collector pair by developing system\u2010wide cost optimization models. Analyzing the properties of the optimal shipment frequency, we observe that the fastest reverse supply chain may not always be the most efficient one.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00157.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['remanufacturing', 'returns', 'supply chain']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and profitability in remanufacturing and supply chain processes, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

For this economic lot scheduling problem with returns (ELSPR), we consider policies with a common cycle time for all products, and with one manufacturing lot and one remanufacturing lot for each product during a cycle. For a given cycle time, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MIP) problem, which provides the basis for an exact solution. The application of this model for one of the core products of the case study company indicates a 16% reduction in cost compared to the current lot scheduling policy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00158.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to economic lot scheduling and cost reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of 'woke' themes."],["2006","15","4","Laurens G.

In this paper, we study the integrated dynamic management of a portfolio of new and remanufactured products that progressively penetrate a potential market over the product life cycle. To this end, we extend the Bass diffusion model in a way that maintains the two essential features of remanufacturing settings: (a) substitution between new and remanufactured products, and (b) a constraint on the diffusion of remanufactured products due to the limited supply of used products that can be remanufactured.

Therefore, capacity planning becomes a strategic issue of major importance for the profitability of closed\u2010loop supply chains. This work studies a closed\u2010loop supply chain with remanufacturing and presents dynamic capacity planning policies developed through the methodology of System Dynamics. The key issue of the paper is how the lifecycles and return patterns of various products affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The model can be used to identify effective policies, to conduct various \u201cwhat\u2010if\u201d analyses, and to answer questions about the long\u2010term profitability of reverse supply chains with remanufacturing. The results of numerical examples with quite different lifecycle and return patterns show how the optimal collection expansion/contraction and remanufacturing contraction policies depend on the lifecycle type and the average usage time of the product, while the remanufacturing capacity expansion policy is not significantly affected by these factors. The results also show that the collection and remanufacturing capacity policies are insensitive to the total product demand. The insensitivity of the optimal policies to total demand is a particularly appealing feature of the proposed model, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate demand forecasts.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00160.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['sustainability', 'remanuacturing', 'capacity planning']","The article discusses closed-loop supply chains and remanufacturing, which touches on sustainability themes; however, it primarily focuses on technical aspects and profitability rather than social justice or equity, leading to a moderate woke score."],["2006","15","4","Necati Aras, Vedat Verter, and Tamer BoyaciView all authors and affiliations","Coordination and Priority Decisions in Hybrid Manufacturing/Remanufacturing Systems","Companies are increasingly realizing the need to coordinate their manufacturing and remanufacturing operations. This can be a challenge due to the inherent variability in the condition and amount of returns, which has a direct impact on remanufacturing costs and leadtimes. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to compare two alternative strategies that use either manufacturing or remanufacturing as the primary means of satisfying customer demand. Of course, in the event that the demand cannot be met by the prioritized process, the secondary process is used as a contingency. In our basic model, the priority decisions are made at the component level in replenishing the serviceable inventory, while the disposal and new component ordering decisions are made independently. The second model represents the coordination of remanufacturable and new component inventory control decisions. Using simulation\u2010based optimization on a large number of experiments, we observe that when prioritization is in the upstream echelon and there is no coordination in managing component stocks, there exists a critical return ratio, below which it is beneficial to give priority to manufacturing and above which it is beneficial to give priority to remanufacturing. We also see that coordinated control of the component inventories considerably reduces the importance of prioritization. These observations remain valid when congestion in the shop floor is also taken into account. We also study the benefits of state\u2010dependent dispatching policies in a realistic case.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00161.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['remanufacturing', 'sustainability', 'inventory control']","The article discusses remanufacturing and operational efficiency, which touches on sustainability themes, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

For instance, an initial small-trade buying pressure exists for loser stocks, and it gradually converts into an intense selling pressure over the following year. The results are consistent with initial underreaction followed by delayed reaction among small traders. Moreover, small-trade imbalances during the formation period significantly affect momentum returns, suggesting that underreaction among small traders contributes to the momentum effect. Large traders, by contrast, show no evidence of underreaction, and large-trade imbalances have little impact on subsequent returns.

Owing to information asymmetry, value-maximizing compensation contracts allow managerial rents following high investment outcomes. The manager has an incentive to increase these rents by choosing investments that generate greater information asymmetry. An aptly chosen debt level mitigates this incentive, because investments that generate greater information asymmetry have more volatile outcomes. The greater volatility would make the debt risky, causing the shareholders to focus on high outcomes and therefore compensation contracts that reduce managerial rents. At the optimum, the manager avoids opportunistic investments, and the shareholders offer value-maximizing compensation contracts. Empirically, the analysis predicts a negative relationship between leverage and market-to-book that is reversed at extreme market-to-book ratios, a negative relationship between leverage and profitability, a negative relationship between leverage and pay-for-performance, and a positive relationship between pay-for-performance and investment opportunities.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/19/2/605/1642293","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on compensation contracts and debt, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We explain this with familiarity, that is, the tendency to concentrate holdings in stocks to which the investor is geographically or professionally close or that he has held for a long period.

Yet, lending markets are less than perfectly competitive. Despite the lower funding cost, therefore, the loan price is not necessarily more favorable to the borrower. However, corporate borrowers are averse to the participation of their loans to other lenders because of the complexity of dealing with multiple banks and the potential information costs of the sale announcement. Consequently, I conjecture that the borrower extracts a price concession in exchange for allowing the bank to sell participations in the loan. Using a hand-matched dataset of loans, borrowers, and lenders, I find that the average yield spread on loans originated by active loan sellers is about 20 basis points lower than the average spread on loans originated by moderate loan sellers.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/19/2/687/1642309","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of loan sales and corporate borrowing costs without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Previous studies propose two major hypotheses for this phenomenon: leverage effect and time-varying expected returns. However, leverage has no impact on asymmetric volatility at the daily frequency and, moreover, we observe asymmetric volatility for stocks with no leverage. Also, expected returns may vary with the business cycle, that is, at a lower than daily frequency. Trading activity of contrarian and herding investors has a robust effect on the relationship between daily volatility and lagged return. Consistent with the predictions of the rational expectation models, the non-informational liquidity-driven (herding) trades increase volatility following stock price declines, and the informed (contrarian) trades reduce volatility following stock price increases. The results are robust to different measures of volatility and trading activity.

Owing to the option\u2019s nonredundancy, the economy\u2019s stochastic discount factor (SDF) depends not only on the market return and the square of the market return but also on the option return, the square of the option return, and the product of the market and option returns. This leads to an asset pricing model in which the expected return on any risky asset depends explicitly on the asset\u2019s coskewness with option returns. The empirical results show that the option coskewness model outperforms several competing benchmark models. Furthermore, option coskewness captures some of the same risks as the Fama\u2013French factors small minus big (SMB) and high minus low (HML). These results suggest that the factors that drive the pricing of nonredundant options are also important for pricing risky equities.(JEL G11, G12, D61)","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/19/4/1279/1580391","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model related to asset pricing without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

We find that financing frictions provide a common factor that improves the pricing of cross-sectional returns. Moreover, the shadow cost of external funds exhibits strong procyclical variation, so that financial frictions are more important in relatively good economic conditions.

Yet convincing investors to invest is not easy, as young firms have limited track records and, thus, face challenges associated with gaining legitimacy in their respective industries. This paper examines ways in which select information about firms undertaking an initial public offering (IPO) can affect investor decisions. Building upon recent research on upper echelons and signaling theory, we propose that the composition of a firm's top management team can signal organizational legitimacy that in turn affects investor decisions. In the context of young firms undertaking an IPO, such signals are critical, especially when objective measures of firm quality are not easily available. We introduce a typology of signals of organizational legitimacy to elaborate on our hypotheses. Analyses of a comprehensive set of data on the career histories of the top management teams of young biotechnology firms show that investor decisions are affected by the extent to which a firm's top management team has employment affiliations with prominent downstream organizations (e.g., pharmaceutical companies), with a diverse range of organizations, and upon the role experience of one key member of the top management team\u2014the Chief Scientific Officer. We assess and find that these effects are not mediated by the prestige of a firm's lead underwriter. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our study for strategy research on upper echelons and organizational legitimacy.

Methodologically, multilevel analysis offers statistical advantages over variance components analysis, nested ANOVA, and two-stage least squares.

This study tests whether author, article, and methodological attributes influence the impact of SMJ articles, defined as summed counts of article citations. Findings reveal that authors having fewer, more-often cited articles tended to have SMJ articles that received the most citations. In addition, whether an article appears in a regular or a special issue is not a stable predictor of its impact. Moreover, empirical articles that test primary data, control for more threats to internal validity, and have higher statistical power tend to receive more citations. Further, an article's long-term impact oftentimes becomes apparent shortly after its publication. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the determinants of impact and its temporal qualities and help explain some of the differences between high and average impact articles. The findings also underscore the need for transparency between author publication strategies (article volume, impact) and the requirements of his/her institution.

However, the licensee may access and exploit this latent knowledge by engaging the inventor during the development phase. This paper examines the hypothesis that licensing strategies that directly engage the inventor increase the likelihood and degree of commercialization success. While this may seem somewhat apparent, firms in the sample under investigation vary substantially in the degree to which they engage the inventor: one third of the sample does not engage the inventor at all. On the other hand, the hypothesis might seem surprising given the norms of open science under which university labs are expected to operate. Regression analyses based on a unique dataset of 124 license agreements associated with inventions from MIT support the hypothesis and generate results that are robust to a variety of controls.

To attain broad scope, firms must repeatedly explore outside the boundaries of their current niche. Firms with broad niches therefore operate under a set of routines that repeatedly propel them into new market segments, expanding their niche. These niche expansions, however, involve risky organizational changes, behavior that disadvantages generalists relative to specialists, despite the positional value of broad scope. Empirical analyses of machine tool manufacturers and computer workstation manufacturers support this conjecture: (i) generalists introduce new products at a higher than optimal rate, thereby increasing their exit rates; and (ii) generalists also more frequently launch new models with novel features or targeted at new consumer segments rather than improving only incrementally on existing products, further accelerating their odds of failure. After adjusting for these behavioral differences, broad niche widths reduce exit rates, suggesting that they provide positional advantages. The paper discusses how this phenomenon may help to explain the diversification and multi-nationality discounts.

The existing literature contains two conflicting approaches to adaptation. The first, more traditional approach, following institutional, motivational, and pragmatic efficiency considerations, presumes that a modified practice can be fine tuned, stabilized, and institutionalized without consulting a working example and that practices should thus be adapted as quickly as possible to create fit with the local environment. The second approach argues, instead, for the need to maintain the diagnostic value of the original practice by adapting cautiously and gradually. In this paper, we report an in-depth field investigation of the relationship between presumptive adaptation, adaptation that removes the diagnostic value of the original practice, and transfer effectiveness. The setting is the transfer of franchising knowledge across borders. We investigate how adherence to recommended practices affects the rate of network growth in the host country. We find that presumptive adaptation stalls network growth while a conservative approach to adaptation, which basically entails close adherence to the original practice, results in remarkably rapid network growth. We conclude that presumptive adaptation of knowledge assets could be detrimental to performance.

These differ primarily on the appropriate role of prediction in the decision process. Prediction is a central issue in strategy making owing to the presumption that what can be predicted can be controlled. In this paper we argue for the independence of prediction and control. This implies that the pursuit of successful outcomes can occur through control-oriented approaches that may essentially be non-predictive. We further develop and highlight control-oriented approaches with particular emphasis on the question of what organizations should do next.

The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

We advance this debate by measuring the financial\u2013social performance link mutual funds that practice socially responsible investing (SRI). SRI fund managers have an array of social screening strategies from which to choose. Prior studies have not addressed this heterogeneity within SRI funds. Combining modern portfolio and stakeholder theories, we hypothesize that the financial loss borne by an SRI fund due to poor diversification is offset as social screening intensifies because better-managed and more stable firms are selected into its portfolio. We find support for this hypothesis through an empirical test on a panel of 61 SRI funds from 1972 to 2000. The results show that as the number of social screens used by an SRI fund increases, financial returns decline at first, but then rebound as the number of screens reaches a maximum. That is, we find a curvilinear relationship, suggesting that two long-competing viewpoints may be complementary. Furthermore, we find that financial performance varies with the types of social screens used. Community relations screening increased financial performance, but environmental and labor relations screening decreased financial performance. Based on our results, we suggest that literatures addressing the link between financial and social performance move toward in-depth examination of the merits of different social screening strategies, and away from the continuing debate on the financial merits of either being socially responsible or not.

We hypothesize that, owing to inertial forces, firms that enter the industry at the earliest point in its history are least likely to make the conversion to the product generation that becomes the dominant design in the industry. Exploration through the introduction of new products appears to reflect a local search process and retards the transition to the dominant design. We also hypothesize that, though firms entering early may exhibit longer life spans, their advantages are limited to the period before the emergence of the dominant design. We test our hypotheses in the early U.S. bicycle industry, and find evidence consistent with the idea that inertia limits firms' abilities to make the transition between generations of product configurations.

Likewise, when they enjoy increasing returns due to network effects, static scale economies, or learning effects, companies have incentives to invest aggressively in growth. This paper presents econometric analysis of factors that determined the intensity of Internet companies' investments in growth, and analyzes the long-term performance consequences of such investments. Results indicate that first movers spent significantly more on upfront marketing than non-pioneers. Contrary to expectations, however, firms in markets that exhibited increasing returns did not spend more on their early customer acquisition efforts than other sample companies. Although the typical sample company did not earn positive long-term returns, heavy early investments in growth were nevertheless economically rational. In most cases, reducing marketing outlays would have worsened a bad outcome, consistent with an inverted \u2018U\u2019 relationship between long-term returns and upfront marketing spending. Thus, the typical sample company invested in marketing, ex ante, at levels close to those that would have maximized returns, observed ex post.

A demand-based perspective for identifying and representing asymmetric competition","A host of strategic management and marketing issues, including competitive analysis and strategic decision making, hinges on accurately identifying and representing competitive market structures. It is readily acknowledged that competitive market structures are typically asymmetric; namely, one firm may actively compete with another in a given market but not vice versa. However, empirical efforts to assess these competitive asymmetries have been lacking in the strategy literature. We propose a new spatial methodology to identify and represent asymmetric competitive market structures. Specifically, we devise a new stochastic multidimensional scaling procedure that is calibrated from actual consumer consideration/choice sets to estimate and uncover competitive asymmetries. The proposed methodology can be effectively employed in the analysis of appropriate data from either demand- or supply-side approaches to assess competitive market structure. We illustrate our proposed methodology with survey data collected from two different commercial applications: one from the U.S. luxury automobile market and the other from the U.S. portable telephone market. We contrast the findings of the proposed methodology against traditional symmetric approaches for identifying and representing competitive market structures, and discuss the respective strategic insights.

From a panel dataset which includes information on all foreign R&D investments made by publicly traded Japanese manufacturing firms (from 1974 to 1994), I show that Japanese firms investing in foreign R&D tend to be the non-dominant market share firms, but also the technologically leading firms across fairly diverse industries.

Any attempt at theory construction in this area must encompass reliable and valid measures for key innovation characteristics. Yet, with respect to an important construct, i.e., disruptiveness of innovations, there has been relatively little academic research. Without formalizing the disruptiveness concept with a reliable and valid measure, it is difficult to conduct rigorous research to uncover the causes of the innovator's dilemma and identify mechanisms to help incumbents develop such innovations. In this paper, we develop a scale for the disruptiveness of innovations. We collected data from senior executives (vice president or general manager level) at 199 strategic business units (SBUs) in 38 Fortune 500 corporations and performed a series of analyses to establish the reliability and validity of the disruptiveness scale. The reliability measures, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and subsequent statistical tests strongly support our measure. Further, we also present nomological validity of the disruptiveness construct, thus establishing its predictive validity. Thus, this paper distinguishes the disruptiveness concept from other established innovation constructs, such as radicalness and competency destroying. Finally, we discuss the significance of our results and how this study might be useful to other researchers.

Product longevity may be driven by both a product's position within a market as well as its position within a firm's larger product portfolio. However, we have little understanding of the relative importance of these factors in determining product turnover and how they interact as an industry evolves. Although researchers have invested substantial effort in analyzing firm survival and turnover, there are far fewer studies of the determinants of product survival and turnover. We use hazard rate models and count regression models to describe the behavior of firms and their products with a new and detailed database on the laser printer industry. We show, first, that competition and market structure variables have a large impact on both speeding product exit and delaying product entry. Second, there is some evidence that firms that have maintained a high market share for a number of years keep their products on the market longer than those with lower market share. Finally, firms with high innovative capacity tend to enter markets frequently, but withdraw their products at average rates. Firms with strong brands tend to introduce few products and withdraw their products slowly. With these findings, the paper links product entry and exit decisions to the broader literature on firm strategic and product management.

Using this approach, we address a variety of questions including whether technology substitutions will be permanent or transitory; the sequence in which new technologies attack different market segments; how rents from different types of resources change over time; whether decreasing marginal utility and imitation give rise to similar rent profiles; the extent of synergies within a firm's resource portfolio; the emergence of new generic strategies; and the conditions that support strategic diversity in a market.

The technologies used by organizations in their pursuit of intelligence can be imagined to change over time as a result of responding to the successes and failures associated with the technologies. Although technologies of rationality seem clearly to be effective instruments of exploitation in relatively simple situations and to derive their adaptive advantage from those capabilities, their ventures in more complex explorations seem often to lead to huge mistakes and thus unlikely to be sustained by adaptive processes. Whether their survival as instruments of exploratory novelty in complex situations is desirable is a difficult question to answer, but it seems likely that any such survival may require hitchhiking on their successes in simpler worlds. Survival may also be served by the heroism of fools and the blindness of true believers. Their imperviousness to feedback is both the despair of adaptive intelligence and, conceivably, its salvation.

In addition, the presence of a separate COO/president increases the likelihood of CEO dismissal under conditions of low firm performance, and this effect is stronger when the magnitude of strategic change is high; but it has no impact on the likelihood of CEO dismissal under conditions of high firm performance.

Using survey data of organizations that documented their EMS adoption costs over a 3-year period, the results show that publicly traded facilities had stronger complementary capabilities prior to EMS adoption and therefore lower adoption costs. By contrast, government facilities and privately owned enterprises had fewer capabilities and accrued higher EMS adoption costs. The development of organizational capabilities and resources therefore appears to be a function of both organizational exploitation of imperfect or incomplete market factors, and the institutional context of these decisions.

An analysis of the role of internal and external relatedness","Previous research on mergers and acquisitions has neglected the issue of speed of postmerger integration by and large. This paper argues that there are benefits and detriments associated with speed of integration. Thus, in some situations speed may be highly beneficial whereas in others it may be harmful to the success of a merger or acquisition. It is argued that the benefits and detriments of speed of integration depend on the magnitude of internal and external relatedness between the merging firms prior to the merger or acquisition. Results from a survey of 232 horizontal mergers and acquisitions show that speed is most beneficial when external relatedness is low and at the same time internal relatedness is high. In contrast, speed is highly detrimental in the case of low internal and high external relatedness.

Our study suggests that the type of external knowledge sourced determines the likelihood of creation of breakthrough innovation. We characterize the external knowledge utilized on two dimensions: its technological space and geographic origin. We draw on the concepts of local search and national innovation systems to identify critical knowledge inputs. We hypothesize that external knowledge characterized by technological distance or proximity and the national or international context can have a differential impact on breakthrough innovation. This is due to the contradictory implications of its value created by distance and to absorptive capacity limitations in effectively utilizing knowledge from a different context. To test our hypotheses we use patent data from the U.S. biotechnology industry. Our findings suggest that technologically distant knowledge of national origin has a curvilinear effect and technologically proximate knowledge of international origin has a positive effect on breakthrough innovation. However, simultaneous exploration along technologically and geographic dimensions is not useful to generating breakthrough innovation; technologically distant knowledge of international origin does not have a significant impact.

Industry dynamism, CEO tenure, and company performance","Scholars have characterized CEO tenures as life cycles in which executives learn rapidly during their initial time in office, but then grow stale as they lose touch with the external environment. We argue, however, that the opportunities for adaptive learning are limited because (1) a CEO assumes office with a relatively fixed paradigm that changes little thereafter; (2) inertia limits the speed at which an organization can align itself with a new CEO's paradigm; and (3) for any within-paradigm learning to occur, the external environment must be stable enough so that the cause\u2013effect relationships that CEOs glean today remain relevant tomorrow. In a longitudinal study of 98 CEOs in the relatively stable branded foods industry and 228 CEOs in the highly dynamic computer industry, we found results that strongly supported our hypotheses. In the stable food industry, firm-level performance improved steadily with tenure, with downturns occurring only among the few CEOs who served more than 10\u201315 years. In contrast, in the dynamic computer industry, CEOs were at their best when they started their jobs, and firm performance declined steadily across their tenures, presumably as their paradigms grew obsolete more quickly than they could learn.

This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called \u2018broken board ties\u2019 (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness.

We propose that a highly relation-specific IT system in inter-firm transactions plays a key role in the resulting inter-firm governance as a mutual sunk-cost commitment, in terms of leading to both less vertical integration (i.e., a change in governance mode as a first-order effect) and a smaller number of suppliers (i.e., a change within a governance mode as a second-order effect). As a result, this highly relation-specific IT system (bilateral investment) can be an alternative governance mode of electronic integration that acts as a substitute for managerial hierarchy and vertical financial ownership. From a strategic management perspective, this paper provides transaction costs and resource-based explanations on IT systems' impact on the organizational boundary decision and its impact on the likelihood of the firm achieving sustainable competitive advantage.

In recent years, on the basis of many empirical studies, it has been claimed that the evidence has corroborated TCE. If so, this would have major implications for the debate between TCE and other approaches to understanding the nature of the firm. In this paper we submit the most prominent TCE empirical work to critical scrutiny, on the basis of the standards and predictions in Williamson's own writings. We find a much more mixed picture, with few studies giving unambiguous support to Williamson's TCE. Furthermore, a significant number of the studies can be reinterpreted in terms of a competence or capabilities approach. We conclude that the empirical evidence does not decisively support Williamson's TCE and we stress the importance of an empirical program of joint testing of rival theoretical approaches.

Foreign owners are typically portfolio investors who frequently buy and sell shares and hold diversified portfolios of small stakes in many firms. Prior research has presented two conflicting perspectives on the role of such investors: (a) their frequent trading leads to pressure for short-term returns that fosters underinvestment; (b) their active trading fosters appropriate investments. We investigated the relationship between foreign ownership and strategic investments using dynamic panel data analysis of a sample of 146 Japanese manufacturing firms from 1991 to 1997. We found that foreign ownership enhances strategic investments (in R&D and capital intensity) to a greater extent when firms have growth opportunities than when they lack such opportunities. We conclude that foreign ownership fosters appropriate investment.

Previous empirical investigations of this assumption, few in number, have faced numerous confounding factors and generated conflicting results. I build a causal model for the relationship between product and organizational modularity, which I test using a distinctive empirical setting that controls for confounding factors present in previous studies. I find support for only part of the assumed relationship, showing that modularity is a more multifaceted concept than previously recognized. In particular, increased product modularity enhances reconfigurability of organizations more quickly than it allows firms to move activities out of hierarchy. The paper contributes to the emerging stream of research that focuses on the previously underappreciated costs of designing and maintaining a modular organization.

Reviewing existing theory to consider how a firm's knowledge base interacts with its product market activity, I address several of these concerns by creating a measure of technological diversity based on citation-weighted patents. The measure indicates a firm's opportunity for corporate diversification based on economies of scope in valuable knowledge assets, is defined for both single- and multibusiness firms, and is not correlated with more fundamental aspects of diversification, such as the number of businesses in the corporate portfolio. Evidence from a large sample of firms shows the positive relationship between diversification based on technological diversity and market-based measures of performance, controlling for R&D intensity and capital intensity as further indicators of the type of assets underlying diversification. Results hold when controlling for the endogeneity of diversification and performance in a cross-sectional sample or when controlling for unobserved factors using panel data.

This paper examines the following research question in the context of this change: What are some factors that influence transition economy firms to successfully change their operating know-how or knowledge sets to reflect the demands of their new environment? Building on some core ideas from literature on organizational imprinting, knowledge-based view of the firm, and firm search, we suggest that two factors have a profound impact on a firm's ability to change. The imprinting effect of firms' prior socialist institutional and market environment adversely impacts their ability to change their operating knowledge. At the same time, firms that search for new knowledge from distant sources (located in mainly non-socialist countries) are able to successfully change their knowledge to meet the demands of the new market-oriented economy. Both of these aspects also have joint interdependent effects on the success of change; distant search mitigates some of the adverse impact of socialist market imprinting, but that is not the case for the impact of socialist institutional imprinting. These findings have interesting implications for both researchers and practitioners involved in transition economy settings.

Instead of being a source of differentiation advantages, UVA activity leverages the SME's existing advantages.

In this paper, we propose that Bayesian approaches are highly relevant not only for strategy problems based on the RBV, but also to its extensions in the areas of dynamic capabilities and co-evolution of industries and firms. Further, we argue that Bayesian methods are equally applicable for a wide range of strategy research questions at both the micro- and macro-level. Bayesian techniques are especially useful in addressing specific methodological challenges related to firm- and individual-level effects, firm-level predictive results, precision with small samples, asymmetric distributions, and the treatment of missing data. Moreover, Bayesian methods readily permit the engineering and updating of more realistic, complex models. We provide a specific illustration of the utility of Bayesian approaches in strategy research on entry order and pioneering advantage to show how they can help to inform research that integrates micro- and macro-phenomena within a dynamic and interactive environment.

Using information on promotions, wages, and performance for professional workers in a cross-section of establishments in four metropolitan areas of the United States, I investigate empirically the proposition that firms strategically organize promotion tournaments to motivate workers to higher levels of performance. I present evidence suggesting that relative performance of workers determines promotions, supporting the notion of internal promotion competitions in which internal hiring policies and fixed job slots combine to create competitions among workers of a given rank in a firm. I then estimate a structural model of promotion tournaments that simultaneously accounts for worker and firm behavior and how the interaction of these behaviors gives rise to promotions. The results are consistent with the prediction of tournament theory that workers are motivated by larger spreads.

More specifically: Can a firm that uses the identical supplier network as competitors and purchases similar inputs from the same plants achieve a competitive advantage through that network? In a sample of U.S. automotive suppliers selling to both Toyota and U.S. automakers, we found that greater knowledge sharing on the part of Toyota resulted in a faster rate of learning within the suppliers' manufacturing operations devoted to Toyota. Indeed, from 1990 to 1996 suppliers reduced defects by 50 percent for Toyota vs. only 26 percent for their largest U.S. customer. The quality differences were found to persist within suppliers because the inter-organizational routines and policies at GM, Ford, and Chrysler acted as barriers to knowledge transfers within suppliers' plants. These findings empirically demonstrate that network resources have a significant influence on firm performance. We also show that some firm resources and capabilities are relation-specific and are not easily transferable (redeployable) to other buyers or networks. This result implies that a firm may be on its production possibility frontier for each customer but the productivity frontier will be different for each customer owing to constraints associated with the customer's network.

The results suggest that experience shapes and facilitates firms' abilities to absorb knowledge spillovers.

In this study, we compare the SOEs to domestic private-owned enterprises (POEs) and foreign-controlled businesses (FCBs) in the context of their organizational cultures. While a new ownership form, many of the POEs evolved from former collectives that reflect the traditional values of Chinese business. Conversely, the FCBs are much more indicative of the large global MNCs. Therefore, we look at the SOEs in the context of these two reference points. We conclude that the SOEs of today have substantially transformed to approximate a configuration desired by the Chinese government when it began the SOE transformation a couple of decades ago to make them globally competitive. The SOEs of today appear to be appropriately described as China's economic dynamic dynamo for the future.

Much of the relevant literature represents the headquarters' viewpoint and broadly assesses antecedents of standardization or adaptation across widely varying markets. Using strategic fit as the theoretical platform for analysis, the study investigates international marketing strategy for a specific product or line within subsidiaries of U.S., Japanese, and German multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in the U.K. The results indicate that degree of strategy standardization is significantly related to similarity between markets with respect to regulatory environments, technological intensity and velocity, customs and traditions, customer characteristics, a product's stage in its life cycle, and competitive intensity. On the critical question of performance consequences, the findings suggest that superior performance results from strategy standardization only to the extent that there is fit or coalignment between the MNC's environmental context and its international marketing strategy choice.

Further analysis reveals that the influence of pro forma emphasis on nonprofessional investors' judgments and decisions seems to be the result of an unintentional cognitive effect as opposed to the perceived informativeness of the earnings figure emphasized by management. Analysts' judgments and decisions were also affected by the presence of reconciliation, but in the opposite direction to those of nonprofessional investors.

We manipulate the transparency of comprehensive income reporting and the relationship of projected earnings to the consensus forecast in a 2\u00d72 between\u2010subjects design.

However, the rarely used, more transparent format for reporting comprehensive income significantly reduces both income\u2010increasing and income\u2010decreasing earnings management. Participants in the less transparent setting indicate that earnings management attempts will not be obvious to readers, will improve stock prices, and have no effect on management's reputation for reporting integrity. Conversely, respondents in the more transparent condition suggest that earnings management will be obvious to readers, harmful to stock prices, and damaging to reporting reputation. Results of this study suggest that more transparent reporting requirements will reduce earnings management in the area of increased transparency or change the focus of earnings management to less visible methods.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/1/135/2853/Financial-Reporting-Transparency-and-Earnings","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['transparency', 'earnings management', 'integrity']","The article discusses transparency in financial reporting, which touches on ethical considerations in accounting practices.

Results from two experiments demonstrate that: (1) guidance form has no effect on analysts' forecasts made immediately after the guidance; and (2) after the actual earnings announcement, guidance form and the relationship of the earnings guidance to actual earnings (guidance error) interact in their effect on analysts' forecasts. After the actual earnings announcement, guidance error leads to higher (lower) analysts' forecasts for firms with downwardly (upwardly) biased guidance; this effect of guidance error is magnified by a narrow range and reduced by a wide range, compared to a point estimate. These results suggest that treating the mean of the range endpoints as equivalent to a point estimate and failing to consider effects after the release of actual earnings may paint an incomplete picture of how management guidance affects analysts and investors. It also offers useful information to managers who issue earnings guidance, and presents a challenge to the psychology literature regarding the effects of information precision on judgment and decision making.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/1/207/2861/Does-the-Form-of-Management-s-Earnings-Guidance","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings guidance and analysts' forecasts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

The evidence suggests that this failure is not the result of a decision to ignore the income shifting, but rather an inability to recognize temporary components of reported earnings. We also find evidence that market prices do not fully reflect the temporary income effects of tax\u2010motivated income shifting, and that analyst inefficiency explains about half of the market inefficiency.

Feedback from repeated competitive bidding markets can teach people to bid well above estimated costs to avoid this winner's curse (Kagel 1995; Kagel and Levin 2002). We present experimental evidence that such learning is substantially hampered by sellers' sense of responsibility for the costs. This effect is consistent with psychological evidence that people tend to attribute bad outcomes to environmental factors out of their control, such as cost\u2010estimation errors, and attribute good outcomes to their own skills, such as their ability to choose effective cost\u2010management initiatives (Miller and Ross 1975; Zuckerman 1979).

More specifically, we examine management turnover and the subsequent employment of displaced managers at firms announcing earnings restatements during 1997 or 1998. In contrast to prior research (Beneish 1999; Agrawal et al. 1999), which does not find increased turnover following GAAP violations or revelation of corporate fraud, we find that 60 percent of restating firms experience a turnover of at least one top manager within 24 months of the restatement compared to 35 percent among age\u2010, size\u2010, and industry\u2010matched firms. Moreover, the subsequent employment prospects of the displaced managers of restatement firms are poorer than those of the displaced managers of control firms. Our results hold after controlling for firm performance, bankruptcy, and other determinants of management turnover, and suggest that both corporate boards and the external labor market impose significant penalties on managers for violating GAAP. Also, in light of resource constraints at the SEC, our findings are encouraging as they suggest that private penalties for GAAP violations are severe and may serve as partial substitutes for public enforcement of GAAP violations.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/1/83/2856/The-Reputational-Penalty-for-Aggressive-Accounting","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['reputational penalties', 'management turnover', 'GAAP violations']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of accounting practices and the consequences of earnings restatements, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We evaluate the predictive ability of our model by benchmarking its performance in forecasting one\u2010year\u2010ahead returns on equity against that of two other time\u2010series models based on line item information reported in the income statement and in the statement of cash flows.

While all three models are less accurate than analysts' consensus forecasts that rely on a larger information set, we find that our model provides substantial improvement in forecast accuracy over the other two models that use only the line items in the financial statements. Finally, invoking the market efficiency assumption, we find that earnings forecast errors based on our model have greater relative information content than forecast errors based on the two alternative models based on financial statement information in explaining abnormal stock returns.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/2/285/2865/Predicting-Earnings-Using-a-Model-Based-on-Cost","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical model for profit analysis without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Using these findings we construct two incentive variables and find a positive association between misreporting behavior and managerial incentives.

Results of an experiment with auditors as participants indicate that auditors use different forms of justifications under different circumstances. Auditors with high tacit managerial knowledge and high technical knowledge have a higher proclivity to enumerate more pro versus con reasons, and to consider a wider breadth of issues when they are required to justify their conclusions to reviewers with dissimilar task preferences. In contrast, high tacit managerial knowledge auditors required to justify to reviewers with similar initial task preferences have a greater tendency to employ an evidence framing approach, in which language is used to emphasize consistent evidence by downplaying associated inconsistent evidence.

Expanded disclosures and accounting practices prior to SFAS No. 133 and mandatory recognition of derivative fair values after SFAS No. 133 provide a natural setting for comparing the valuation implications of recognized and disclosed derivative fair value information. This unique setting mitigates many of the research design problems with recognition versus disclosure studies. Using a sample of banks that simultaneously hold recognized and disclosed derivatives prior to SFAS No. 133, we find that the valuation coefficients on recognized derivatives are significant, whereas the valuation coefficients on disclosed derivatives are not significant. Further, using a sample of banks that have only disclosed derivatives prior to SFAS No. 133, which are recognized after SFAS No.133, we find that while the valuation coefficients on disclosed derivatives are not significant, the valuation coefficients on recognized derivatives are significant. These results are consistent with the view that recognition and disclosure are not substitutes.

In addition, this study investigates to what extent investors incorporate the forecasting implications of the tax change component of earnings into stock prices. I find that there is a positive, significant association between the tax change component of earnings and future earnings. I use the interim reporting requirements of APB No. 28 (APB 1973) and FASB Interpretation No. 18 (FASB 1977) to further decompose the tax change component into an initial and a revised portion based on the first quarter estimate of the annual effective tax rates (ETR). I find that the initial tax change component is more persistent for future earnings than the revised tax change component. These results are consistent with my hypotheses that the initial and revised tax change components have differential persistence and forecasting implications, and dispute the broad notion advanced by prior literature that ETR\u2010related earnings changes are transitory. Results from market tests indicate that the market underweights the forecasting implications of the tax change component and the mispricing appears to be driven by the transitory nature of the revised tax change component.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/3/589/2881/The-Persistence-Forecasting-and-Valuation","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to tax changes and earnings forecasting without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

The three measures of audit quality examined are the auditor's propensity to issue a going\u2010concern audit opinion for distressed companies, the direction and amount of abnormal working capital accruals, and just beating (missing) earnings benchmarks. For long tenure observations we find a lower propensity to issue a going\u2010concern opinion and some evidence of just beating (missing) earnings benchmarks, consistent with deterioration in audit quality associated with long audit partner tenure.

In this paper, we explore how varying levels of pre\u2010contract, asymmetric information affect the owner\u2010manager relationship. We provide three main sets of insights. First, we find that the owner's payoffs are initially decreasing, and strictly convex everywhere, in the quality of the manager's private information. The owner thus prefers to deal with either a perfectly informed or a perfectly uninformed manager, and we characterize conditions for either to be the preferred choice. Second, in contrast to recent work, we demonstrate that when information can be communicated internally, the optimal strength of managerial incentives unambiguously decreases as the manager becomes better informed. Third, we derive the surprising result that a self\u2010interested manager does not always prefer to maximize his informational advantage.

Disagreement exists, however, as to the explanation for this result. One stream of literature follows Sloan's lead in arguing that this result is attributable to accounting distortions (Xie 2001; Dechow and Dichev 2002; Richardson et al. 2005). A second stream of literature argues that this result is attributable to a more general growth effect and that growth\u2010related factors such as diminishing returns to new investment explain the lower persistence of accruals (e.g., Fairfield et al. 2003a; Cooper et al. 2005). We provide new evidence indicating that temporary accounting distortions are a significant contributing factor to the lower persistence of the accrual component of earnings. Our evidence indicates that the lower persistence of accruals extends to accruals that are unrelated to sales growth and that extreme accruals are systematically associated with alleged cases of earnings manipulation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/3/713/2886/The-Implications-of-Accounting-Distortions-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and profitability without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This paper examines the changes in discretionary accruals surrounding the appointment of a new CFO. Using a sample of 712 companies that appointed a new CFO in the period 1994 to 2000, we find that discretionary accruals decreased significantly following the appointment of a new CFO. Our tests indicate that this reduction is significantly greater for our group of CFO\u2010hiring firms than for a control group of non\u2010hiring firms, and that the changes are not driven by a concurrent appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). We also find that our results are largely driven by firms that hire a new CFO from outside the company.

The investors rationally interpret his actions and adjust the price accordingly. When the distribution of true earnings and the compensation scheme are smooth, the conventional equilibrium in this signaling framework is also smooth and fully revealing. In this paper, we show that in the same \u201csmooth\u201d environment there exist equilibria in which kinks and discontinuities emerge endogenously in the distribution of reported earnings. The manager optimally chooses a partially pooling strategy, introducing endogenous noise into his report. The resulting vagueness enables the manager to reduce the average manipulation costs. The equilibrium has perfect revelation of earnings in the right and left tails of the distribution, while for intermediate earnings realizations, we get one or more pools that manifest themselves as discontinuities in the distribution of reported earnings.

Other SEC reforms mandate the disclosure of fees for auditor\u2010provided services and are aimed at influencing investors' perceptions of auditor independence. These fee disclosures also reveal audit committees' pre\u2010approval decisions, enhancing public accountability. Thus, audit committees may be less willing to hire auditors for nonaudit services to avoid fee disclosures, even when joint provision improves audit quality. One hundred experienced corporate directors, responding as audit committee members or investors, participated in an experiment in which we manipulated the effect of the auditor's provision of nonaudit services on audit quality and the fee disclosure requirement. We find that audit committee members are more likely to recommend joint provision if audit quality improves, consistent with investors' preferences. However, unlike investors, committee members are more reluctant to recommend joint provision when public disclosures are required, even at the expense of audit quality.

The empirical results show that, if financial performance measures are \u201cgood\u201d (\u201cpoor\u201d) incentive measures, i.e., high (low) on sensitivity, precision, and verifiability, then using these measures for incentive purposes increases (decreases) delegation.

Instead, the evidence suggests that investors and analysts only gradually incorporate this information into prices and forecasts as they observe the effects of the pension plan changes on subsequent quarterly earnings. The persistent tardiness of analysts to incorporate this relevant and economically significant information about earnings is surprising given that they are provided with pension information on a repeated and timely basis.

As performance measures become noisier, the conventional agency analysis predicts that principals will reduce the incentive weights assigned to such measures. However, prior empirical results (Prendergast 2002) frequently find the opposite, i.e., incentive weights are larger (agents bear more risk) in more uncertain environments. This paper provides new evidence on the association between the extent of uncertainty and the level of risk imposed on agents. In the context of contracts between managed care organizations and physicians, we examine the effect of task characteristics and the legal liability environment on the extent of risk that physicians bear. We derive the optimal weighting of multiple performance measures in a model of a physician's choice of revenue\u2010generating and cost\u2010control efforts. The model predicts that physicians who face less task uncertainty bear more cost risk in their contracts, as predicted by the conventional moral hazard model. Likewise, the model predicts that as the association between task uncertainty and legal liability uncertainty becomes stronger, physicians bear less cost risk in their contracts. Our empirical results generally support these predictions. We offer an explanation for why these results tend to be consistent with the conventional moral hazard analysis, contrary to empirical results in a number of previous studies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/5/1045/2896/Uncertainty-Legal-Liability-and-Incentive","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of incentive contracts and moral hazard without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using the Heckman MLE procedure to control for selection bias in tax fee disclosure, we find that a strong pre\u20102002 positive association between tax fees and higher than expected audit fees weakened significantly in 2002, suggesting that some companies paying high audit fees reduced or terminated auditor\u2010provided tax services in 2002.

Finally, we provide some evidence that the lower earnings management associated with VC monitoring partially explains the superior post\u2010IPO returns of VC\u2010backed firms.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/5/1119/2887/Do-Venture-Capitalists-Influence-the-Decision-to","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of venture capitalists' influence on earnings management without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

This suggests that the accrual anomaly is part of the overall value\u2010glamour anomaly and does not represent the mispricing of earnings. We extend the literature by using multiple measures of abnormal accruals and separate analyses of future annual returns and future earnings announcement returns. The results reveal that the operating cash flows\u2010to\u2010price ratio does not subsume abnormal accruals in explaining future annual returns or future announcement returns. We also find that the operating cash flows\u2010to\u2010price ratio does not subsume total accruals in explaining future announcement returns. These results are not consistent with accruals being a manifestation of the value\u2010glamour anomaly. Our study contributes to the current debate on the existence and the extent of the (abnormal) accrual anomaly. Moreover, the methodology employed can help researchers in exploring mispricing phenomena.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/5/1151/2900/Evidence-of-the-Abnormal-Accrual-Anomaly","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of accounting and financial anomalies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Our first hypothesis is that higher quality accounting enhances investment efficiency by reducing information asymmetry between managers and outside suppliers of capital. Our second hypothesis is that this effect should be stronger in economies where financing is largely provided through arm's\u2010length transactions compared with countries where creditors supply more capital. Our results are consistent with these hypotheses both across and within countries. They are robust to alternative econometric specifications, different measures of accounting quality and investment\u2010cash flow sensitivity, and numerous control variables.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/5/963/2898/Accounting-Quality-and-Firm-Level-Capital","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting quality and investment efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To isolate the effects of reporting incentives, we exploit the fact that, within the European Union, privately held corporations face the same accounting standards as publicly traded companies because accounting regulation is based on legal form. We focus on the level of earnings management as one dimension of accounting quality that is particularly responsive to firms' reporting incentives. We document that private firms exhibit higher levels of earnings management and that strong legal systems are associated with less earnings management in private and public firms. We also provide evidence that private and public firms respond differentially to institutional factors, such as book\u2010tax alignment, outside investor protection, and capital market structure. Moreover, legal institutions and capital market forces often appear to reinforce each other.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/81/5/983/2902/The-Importance-of-Reporting-Incentives-Earnings","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and capital market pressures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.
