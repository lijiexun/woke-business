Consistent linkages have not been demonstrated for firm performance and CEO, officer, director, institutional, or blockholder equity. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of relevant empirical ownership-performance studies. The meta-analyses provide few examples of systematic relationships, lending little support for agency theory.

Tests of these hypotheses in a sample of business unit management teams provided strong support.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/30040638","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['functional background', 'power centralization', 'team decision making']","The article discusses team dynamics and decision-making processes, touching on aspects of involvement and power structures, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We test our hypotheses with large-sample survey data on the identities of CEOs' advice contacts and archival data on firm performance and corporate strategy. The results confirm our hypotheses and show that executives' social network ties can influence firms' responses to economic adversity, in particular by inhibiting strategic change in response to relatively poor firm performance. Additional findings indicate that CEOs' advice seeking in response to low performance may ultimately have negative consequences for subsequent performance, suggesting how CEOs' social network ties could play an indirect role in organizational decline and downward spirals in firm performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3556617","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['advice networks', 'CEOs', 'corporate strategy', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on the influence of CEOs' social networks on corporate strategy and performance, lacking a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Because chains' naming strategies have been shown to be critical to their success, we examine the effects of component failures on naming strategies. We advance organizational and interorganizational learning processes to explain chains' adoption of local naming strategies, which stress local adaptation, or common naming strategies, which emphasize standardization. In contrast to past research emphasizing learning from success, we focus on learning from the failure of strategy, specifically, the failure of a chain's own and other chains' commonly and locally named components. Two fundamental results emerge from our analysis of Ontario nursing home chains' naming strategies from 1971 to 1996. One is that nursing home chains learned from their own and others' failures, and the second is that the chains learned less from failures when they had a historical investment in the failing strategy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3556618","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['failure', 'learning', 'naming strategies']","The article discusses learning from failures within organizational strategies, which touches on themes of adaptation and improvement.

Recent theory holds that as the number of organizations using a particular external identity code first increases beyond a critical minimal level, the code becomes an organizational form. Going beyond this formulation, we theorize about how an external identity code is established. We argue that when the identities of individual organizations are perceptually focused, they will more readily cohere into a distinct collective identity. We develop ideas about how two observable aspects of organizations might generate perceptually focused identities in a common market: (1) de novo entry and (2) agglomeration in a geographic place with a related identity. Using comprehensive data from the market for disk drive arrays, we test these ideas and an alternative by estimating effects of different specifications of organizational and product densities on rates of entry and exit for array producers.

We adapt Latour's distinction between ostensive and performative to build a theory that explains why routines are a source of change as well as stability. The ostensive aspect of a routine embodies what we typically think of as the structure. The performative aspect embodies the specific actions, by specific people, at specific times and places, that bring the routine to life. We argue that the ostensive aspect enables people to guide, account for, and refer to specific performances of a routine, and the performative aspect creates, maintains, and modifies the ostensive aspect of the routine. We argue that the relationship between ostensive and performative aspects of routines creates an on-going opportunity for variation, selection, and retention of new practices and patterns of action within routines and allows routines to generate a wide range of outcomes, from apparent stability to considerable change. This revised ontology of organizational routines provides a better explanation of empirical findings than existing theories of routines and has implications for a wide range of organizational theories.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3556620","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['change', 'flexibility', 'organizational routines']","The article discusses organizational routines and their potential for change, but it does not explicitly address themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we propose that the presence of subgroups within a team may stimulate learning behavior and that organizational design features, such as performance management by an external leader, team empowerment, and the availability of a knowledge management system, may have different effects on teams, depending on subgroup strength. Data on 156 teams in five pharmaceutical and medical products firms confirmed that moderately strong demographic subgroups in teams fostered learning behavior. In addition, both very homogeneous and very heterogeneous teams were more inclined to engage in learning behavior, but only if we controlled for the concurrent effect of subgroup strength.

We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&D firm.

Depicting the hold that economics has had on how the relationship between the firm and society is conceived, we examine the consequences for organizational research and theory by appraising both the 30-year quest for an empirical relationship between a corporation's social initiatives and its financial performance, as well as the development of stakeholder theory.

We examine (1) how directors who participate in corporate governance changes that reflect greater board control over management may be subjected to a kind of informal social sanctioning, which we refer to as social distancing, on other boards; (2) how the tendency for directors to experience social distancing may be moderated by their status in the corporate elite; and (3) how directors who experience such social control could be deterred from participating subsequently in governance changes that threaten the interests of fellow top managers. We test our hypotheses with survey data on processes of social control from a sample of directors and CEOs at Forbes 500 companies and archival data on director participation in four corporate governance changes. The findings show that (1) directors who participate in governance changes that threaten managerial interests experience a higher level of social distancing on other boards, particularly when they have low to medium status in the corporate elite, and (2) directors are less likely to participate in such changes if they have recently experienced social distancing (directly or indirectly).

This article extends a formal model of cascading organizational change by examining the implications for organizational change of the limited foresight of those who initiate such change about unit interconnections (structural opacity) and the normative restrictiveness imposed on architectural features by organizational culture (cultural asperity). Opacity leads actors to underestimate the lengths of periods of reorganization and the associated costs of change, thereby prompting them unwittingly to undertake changes with adverse consequences. Increased opacity and asperity lengthen the total time that the organization spends reorganizing and the associated opportunity costs; and the expected effect of an architectural change on mortality hazards increases with the intricacy of the organizational design, structural opacity, and the asperity of organizational culture.

We predict and find that firms whose governance of a core transaction is poor (according to transaction cost reasoning) will realize lower profits than their better-aligned counterparts and that these firms will attempt to adapt so as to better align their transactions. Results show that several organizational features affect the rate of adaptation: (1) firms with large investments in specialized assets adapt less readily than firms that rely on generic assets, (2) firms with unions adapt less readily than firms without unions, (3) firms that must replace employee drivers with owner-operators adapt less readily than firms that must replace owner-operators with employee drivers, and (4) entrants adapt more quickly than incumbent carriers. There is evidence of institutional isomorphism in that although carriers move systematically to reduce misalignment, they do so less assiduously when this will make their governance of drivers look less like that of nearby, similar carriers.

The theory draws on status characteristics theory and past research on groups to propose that while attributions of expertise in work groups will be informed by both specific (i.e., task-relevant) and diffuse (i.e., social category) status cues, the strength of this association will be contingent on the type of cue as well as on characteristics of the group context. So, whereas specific status cues will better predict attributions of expertise in decentralized, longer-tenured groups, diffuse status cues will better predict attributions of expertise in centralized, shorter-tenured groups. Further, attributions of expertise should fully mediate the relationship between members' status cues and intragroup influence. A multilevel test of these hypotheses in a sample of self-managed production teams in a Fortune 100 high-technology firm provides strong support. Group-level analyses confirm that the alignment of intragroup influence with specific status cues is positively associated with group performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3556637","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['status cues', 'expertise', 'group context']","The article discusses the role of status cues in recognizing expertise within work groups, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on DEI or social justice themes.

In this paper, we test a number of explanations of what happened to the kibbutz, using an analysis of the founding rate of the kibbutz population. We find support for popular accounts that the kibbutz stagnated partly as a result of the development in Israel of capitalism and of alternatives for structuring community relations. We also find that a less recognized influence, the state, was a critical determinant of favorable and unfavorable kibbutz outcomes. Our analysis shows that early in the twentieth century, the kibbutz flourished as a source of the order that the states to which it was subject were unable to provide. Over time, the states of Palestine and Israel developed more capacity to govern and displaced the kibbutz from the order-provision role. We also show an active rivalry, with the State of Israel attacking the kibbutz to shore up its own autonomy and in the process delegitimizing the kibbutz movement. These results suggest revisions to the conclusions that are typically drawn from the \u201ckibbutz experiment.\u201d They also suggest that some organizational forms may experience symbiosis, competition, and rivalry with the state and that these factors can be key determinants of the state's actions and the forms' evolution.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3556638","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","4","['socialist', 'community relations', 'state', 'autonomy', 'delegitimizing']","The article discusses the kibbutz as a socialist organizational form and its interactions with the state, suggesting themes of community and autonomy.

Categorizations of distinctiveness appeared to be most threatened by the loss of office personalization because of three characteristics: (1) their absolute, rather than graded membership structure, (2) their high subjective importance and personal relevance, and (3) their high reliance on physical markers for affirmation.

We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth.

In this paper we examine the structural variables that affect IT payoff through a meta analysis of 66 firm-level empirical studies between 1990 and 2000. Employing logistic regression and discriminant analyses, we present statistical evidence of the characteristics that discriminate between IT payoff studies that observed a positive effect and those that did not. In addition, we conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on a continuous measure of IT payoff to examine the influence of structural variables on the result of IT payoff studies. The results indicate that the sample size, data source (firm-level or secondary), and industry in which the study is conducted influence the likelihood of the study finding greater improvements on firm performance. The choice of the dependent variable(s) also appears to influence the outcome (although we did not find support for process-oriented measurement), the type of statistical analysis conducted, and whether the study adopted a cross-sectional or longitudinal design.

The present research develops and tests a new theoretical model of the underlying observational learning processes by which modeling-based training interventions influence computer task performance. Observational learning processes are represented as a second-order construct with four dimensions (attention, retention, production, and motivation). New measures for these dimensions were developed and shown to have strong psychometric properties. The proposed model controls for two pretraining individual differences (motivation to learn and self-efficacy) and specifies the relationships among three training outcomes (declarative knowledge, post-training self-efficacy, and task performance). The model was tested using PLS on data from an experiment (N= 95) on computer spreadsheet training. As hypothesized, observational learning processes significantly influenced training outcomes. A representative modeling-based training intervention (retention enhancement) significantly improved task performance through its specific effects on the retention processes dimension of observational learning. The new model provides a more complete theoretical account of the mechanisms by which modeling-based interventions affect training outcomes, which should enable future research to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of modeling-based training interventions. Further, the new instruments can be used by practitioners to refine ongoing training programs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.14.2.146.16016","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of computer skill training and observational learning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Within the IS discipline, a significant percentage of research has been devoted to examining the conditions and contexts under which relationships may vary, often under the general umbrella of contingency theory (cf. McKeen et al. 1994, Weill and Olson 1989). In our survey of such studies, the majority failed to either detect or provide an estimate of the effect size. In cases where effect sizes are estimated, the numbers are generally small. These results have led some researchers to question both the usefulness of contingency theory and the need to detect interaction effects (e.g., Weill and Olson 1989). This paper addresses this issue by providing a new latent variable modeling approach that can give more accurate estimates of interaction effects by accounting for the measurement error that attenuates the estimated relationships. The capacity of this approach at recovering true effects in comparison to summated regression is demonstrated in a Monte Carlo study that creates a simulated data set in which the underlying true effects are known. Analysis of a second, empirical data set is included to demonstrate the technique's use within IS theory.

The purpose of this essay is to clarify the concept of generalizability by critically examining its nature, illustrating its use and misuse, and presenting a framework for classifying its different forms. The framework organizes the different forms into four types, which are defined by the distinction between empirical and theoretical kinds of statements. On the one hand, the framework affirms the bounds within which statistical, sampling-based generalizability is legitimate.

The applicability of the simulation platform is demonstrated for Yankee auctions in particular. We focus on the optimization of bid takers' revenue, as well as on examining the welfare implications of a range of consumer-bidding strategies\u2014some observed, some hypothetical. While these progressive open discriminatory multiunit auctions with discrete bid increments are made feasible by Internet technologies, little is known about their structural characteristics, or their allocative efficiency. The multiunit and discrete nature of these mechanisms renders the traditional analytic framework of gametheory intractable (Nautz and Wolfstetter 1997). The simulation is based on theoretical revenue generating properties of these auctions. We use empirical data from real online auctions to instantiate the simulation's parameters. For example, the bidding strategies of the bidders are specified based on three broad bidding strategies observed in real online auctions. The validity of the simulation model is established and subsequently the simulation model is configured to change the values of key control factors, such as the bid increment. Our analysis indicates that the auctioneers are, most of the time, far away from the optimal choice of bid increment, resulting in substantial losses in a market with already tight margins. The simulation tool provides a test bed for jointly exploring the combinatorial space of design choices made by the auctioneer's and the bidding strategies adopted by the bidders. For instance, a multinomial logit model reveals that endogenous factors, such as the bid increment and the absolute magnitude of the auction have a statistically significant impact on consumer-bidding strategies. This endogeniety is subsequently modeled into the simulation to investigate whether the effects are significant enough to alter the optimal bid increments or auctioneer revenues.

Analysis patterns can greatly benefit this phase because they capture abstractions of situations that occur frequently in conceptual modeling. Na\u00efve approaches to automate conceptual design with reuse of analysis patterns have had limited success because they do not emulate the learning that occurs over time. This research develops learning mechanisms for improving analysis pattern reuse in conceptual design. The learning mechanisms employ supervised learning techniques to support the generic reuse tasks of retrieval, adaptation, and integration, and emulate expert behaviors of analogy making and designing by assembly. They are added to a na\u00efve approach and the augmented methodology implemented as an intelligent assistant to a designer for generating an initial conceptual design that a developer may refine. To assess the potential of the methodology to benefit practice, empirical testing is carried out on multiple domains and tasks of different sizes.

Based on the knowledge literature, IT competence is defined as \u201c the set of IT-related knowledge and experience that a business manager possesses.\u201d The relationship between IT knowledge, IT experience, and championing IT is tested empirically using Structural Equation Modeling with LISREL.

The contribution of IT knowledge and IT experience to their intention to champion IT was assessed using the second half of the data set. The results show that IT knowledge and IT experience together explain 34% of the variance in managers' intentions to champion IT.

In a recent edition ofISR, a scale for consensus on appropriation was developed. Consensus on appropriation is one of three global constructs incorporated in adaptive structuration theory (Poole and DeSanctis 1990). The principal components analysis on the initial questionnaire revealed two factors with eigenvalues greater than one. While the methods used to develop the scale were thorough, the weaker factor was excluded from the rest of the analysis with little justification. We suggest that this finding has two possible explanations, multidimensionality or response bias. This research note suggests that in addition to the convergent and discriminant validity that Salisbury et al. (2002) provided for the consensus on appropriation scale, we may have an opportunity to further refine the measurement of this construct. By further exploring this principal component finding, consensus on appropriation may be better understood and measured.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.14.4.356.24903","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['appropriation', 'measurement', 'bias']","The article primarily focuses on measurement techniques in behavioral research without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

However, justification memos can be prepared using different approaches. In this study we examine the impact of using three justification memos: supporting, balanced, and component. Using a comprehensive control environment case based on an actual client that experienced fraud, we find that the justification memo used can affect the judgments of auditors preparing the memos as well as the judgments of auditors who review their work. Specifically, the results indicate that auditors using an unrestricted component memo, who were required to write memos for components of their task by providing important positive and negative evidence, thought that the firm's control environment was more likely to prevent fraud as compared with the supporting and balanced memo groups. Additional analyses suggest that the reason for this result is that an unrestricted component memo focuses auditors\u2019 attention on a larger percentage of positive control environment characteristics when a firm's underlying evidence set is mostly positive. This may be problematic because firms can have more positive than negative control environment characteristics, even when fraud is present.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00094","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['justification', 'judgments', 'fraud']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of audit judgments and justification memos without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

In this study, we investigate whether costs are \u201csticky\u201d\u2014that is, whether costs increase more when activity rises than they decrease when activity falls by an equivalent amount. We find, for 7,629 firms over 20 years, that selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs increase on average 0.55% per 1% increase in sales but decrease only 0.35% per 1% decrease in sales. Our analysis compares the traditional model of cost behavior in which costs move proportionately with changes in activity with an alternative model in which sticky costs occur because managers deliberately adjust the resources committed to activities.

Whether this regime is effective or useful is an open question, especially in the absence of data on the behavior of unregulated economies. Privacy disclosure in e-commerce is essentially an unregulated environment with some parallels to financial disclosure. A study of privacy standards, disclosures practices, and demand for audits can help accountants and security regulators project the consequences of a competitive regime sans regulation for accounting standards, disclosure and audit practices. In this article we set up a framework for such a study, gather data from the field, and analyze privacy standards, privacy disclosure practices, and the effectiveness of opt-out practices of 100 high-traffic e-commerce Web sites. We observe four diverse sets of privacy standards (TRUSTe, BBB Online, WebTrust, and PWC Privacy) competing in this market, attracting clienteles of their own as reflected in privacy policies and the disclosure of such policies. With a few exceptions, actual disclosure and opt-out practices correspond reasonably well to stated policies in e-commerce. There is little evidence that the prevailing competitive regime induces a race to the bottom with respect to privacy standards and disclosures. We explore the implications of these results for the consequences of a competitive regime for regulation of financial reporting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00104","the effects of regulation (including taxation) on financial reporting and disclosure","JAR","Accounting","3","['privacy', 'disclosure', 'standards']","The article discusses privacy standards and disclosure practices in e-commerce, which touches on ethical considerations in accounting.

First, I highlight that the sources of cross-listing effects are not obvious and are difficult to disentangle. To illustrate this point, I replicate the analysis using cross-listed Canadian firms, for which mandated disclosures are held constant. Thus, if disclosure effects are important for documented cross-listing effects, I expect to find no relation in the Canadian sample. The findings for forecast accuracy are consistent with this hypothesis. However, analyst following continues to be significantly higher for cross-listed Canadian firms. These findings suggest that the sources of cross-listing effects differ for analyst coverage and forecast accuracy.

We find that cross-listed firms differ in terms of the time-series properties of earnings and accruals, and the degree of association between accounting data and share prices. Cross-listed firms appear to be less aggressive in terms of earnings management and report accounting data that are more conservative, take account of bad news in a more timely manner, and are more strongly associated with share price. Furthermore, the differences appear to result partially from changes around cross-listing and partially from differences in accounting quality before listing.

It exploits a unique setting in which the two sets of standards are put on a level playing field. Firms trading in Germany's New Market must choose between IAS and U.S. GAAP for financial reporting, but face the same regulatory environment otherwise. Thus, institutional factors such as listing requirements, market microstructure, and standards enforcement are held constant. In this setting, differences in the bid-ask spread and share turnover between IAS and U.S. GAAP firms are statistically insignificant and economically small. Subsequent analyses of analysts' forecast dispersion, initial public offering underpricing, and firms' standard choices corroborate these findings. Thus, at least for New Market firms, the choice between IAS and U.S. GAAP appears to be of little consequence for information asymmetry and market liquidity.

I consider two pricing mechanisms\u2014activity-based pricing (ABP) and traditional pricing\u2014and two cost-accounting systems\u2014activity-based costing (ABC) and traditional costing, for support services. Under traditional pricing, only the base product is priced, whereas support services are provided free because detailed cost-driver volume information on the consumption of support services by each customer is unavailable. Under ABP, customers pay based on the quantities consumed of both the base product and the support services because detailed cost-driver volume information is available for each customer. Likewise, under traditional costing for support services the firm makes pricing decisions on cost signals that are noisier than they are under ABC. I compare the equilibrium quantities of the base product and support services sold, the information rent paid to the customers, and the expected profits of the monopolist under all four combinations of cost-driver volume and cost-driver rate information.\n         I show that ABP helps reduce control problems, such as moral hazard and adverse selection problems, for the supplier and increases the supplier's ability to engage in price discrimination. I show that firms are more likely to adopt ABP when their customer base is more diverse, their customer support costs are more uncertain, their costing system has lower measurement error, and the variable costs of providing customer support are higher. Firms adopt ABC when their cost-driver rates for support services under traditional costing are noisier measures of actual costs relative to their cost-driver rates under ABC and when the actual costs of support services are inherently uncertain. I also show that cost-driver rate information and cost-driver volume information for support services are complements.\n         Although the prior literature views ABC and activity-based management (ABM) as facilitating better decision making, I show that ABC and ABP (a form of ABM) are useful tools for addressing control problems in supply chains.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00113","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['diverse', 'moral hazard', 'price discrimination']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of pricing mechanisms and cost accounting systems, with only a minor mention of diversity in the customer base.

We report two experiments, which provide evidence that the dual-source model of overconfidence (Sniezek and Buckley [1991]) predicts the circumstances in which investors are more likely to rely on disciplined trading strategies. Our results indicate that reliance is more likely when investors trade portfolios of securities rather than trading on a case-by-case basis, particularly when investors have received feedback that their previous (unaided) trading decisions have been unprofitable. These results are driven by the number of shares that investors transact rather than by investors' directional agreement with the recommendations of the trading strategy, suggesting that the effects of a portfolio approach and trading experience occur by mitigating investors' overconfidence. The effects violate an aspect of economic rationality because our experiments ensure that investors in all conditions trade the same set of securities based on the same set of information.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00114","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading strategies and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a trading-window proxy for the existence of such restrictions, I test predictions that insiders will demand compensation for these restrictions and that firms will need to increase incentives to restricted insiders. I find that firms that restrict insider trading pay a premium in total compensation relative to firms not restricting insider trading, after controlling for economic determinants of pay. Furthermore, these firms use more incentive-based compensation and their insiders hold larger equity incentives relative to firms that do not restrict insider trading. These results hold after controlling for the endogenous decision to restrict insiders and are consistent with the notion that insider trading plays a role in rewarding and motivating executives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00115","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of insider trading and executive compensation without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

It exploits a unique setting in which the two sets of standards are put on a level playing field. Firms trading in Germany's New Market must choose between IAS and U.S. GAAP for financial reporting, but face the same regulatory environment otherwise. Thus, institutional factors such as listing requirements, market microstructure, and standards enforcement are held constant. In this setting, differences in the bid-ask spread and share turnover between IAS and U.S. GAAP firms are statistically insignificant and economically small. Subsequent analyses of analysts' forecast dispersion, initial public offering underpricing, and firms' standard choices corroborate these findings. Thus, at least for New Market firms, the choice between IAS and U.S. GAAP appears to be of little consequence for information asymmetry and market liquidity. These findings do not support widespread claims that U.S. GAAP produce financial statements of higher informational quality than IAS.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2003.00111.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and their impact on information asymmetry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we find that the market's reaction to confirming forecasts is significantly positive, indicating that benefits accrue to firms that disclose such forecasts. In addition, although we find no significant change in the mean consensus forecasts (a proxy for earnings expectations) around the confirming forecast date, evidence indicates a significant reduction in the mean and median consensus analyst dispersion (a proxy for earnings uncertainty).

At the time of the IPO, there is a relative lack of information to facilitate the establishment of equity values, suggesting that the information provided by outside \u201cexperts\u201d (e.g., auditors, underwriters) is particularly important. In this article we study small, non-venture-backed IPOs, a segment of the market with the poorest long-run performance and where the prestigious audit firm is often the sole (if any) expert present. We find that the pre-IPO opinions of larger auditors are more predictive of post-IPO negative stock delistings. Of particular note, the opinions of the national-tiered firms are comparably predictive to those of the Big 6, though this finding emerges only after we consider the selectivity-based differences in the clients that hire these national firms. Our findings also indicate that, for larger auditors the presence of a pre-IPO going-concern opinion is more strongly associated with first-year stock returns and that larger auditors are more likely to give such opinions to their distressed clients. Overall, we address a deficiency in the literature relating to \u201cthe paucity of evidence on the value of auditor opinions to investors\u201d (Healy and Palepu [ 2001 p. 415]).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00120","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of auditor opinions and their predictive value in the context of IPOs, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

As done in prior studies, we maintain that fees proxy for the level of service provided and follow the physical flow of knowledge. Estimating single-equation models of audit and non-audit fee models, we confirm prior findings of an association between audit and non-audit fees. Studies conclude that such evidence is consistent with knowledge spillovers between the two services. However, we document empirically that audit and non-audit fees are simultaneously determined. Because the data indicate audit and non-audit fees are jointly determined, we then investigate whether previously documented associations between audit and non-audit fees are the result of biased estimation induced by using endogenous variables in single-equation models. In contrast to results from single-equation estimations, we find no association between audit and non-audit fees using a simultaneous specification of the fee system, suggesting that single-equation estimations suffer from simultaneous-equations bias. In sum, the findings are not consistent with the existence of economies of scope from the joint performance of audit and non-audit services after controlling for the joint behavior of audit and non-audit fees. Given the ongoing debate over the level of allowed non-audit services by auditors, the argument for the joint provision of audit and non-audit services is less justified than if joint-supply benefits had been documented.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00121","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of audit and non-audit fees without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

In addition to the familiar moral hazard problem, the principal faces the task of motivating a manager to undertake \u201csoft\u201d investments. These investments are not directly contractible, but the principal can instead rely on leading indicator variables that provide a noisy forecast of the investment returns to be received in future periods. Our analysis relates the role of leading indicator variables to the duration of the manager's incentive contract. With short-term contracts, leading indicator variables are essential in mitigating a holdup problem resulting from the fact that investments are sunk at the end of the first period. With long-term contracts, leading indicator variables will be valuable if the manager's compensation schemes are not stationary over time. The leading indicator variables then become an instrument for matching the future investment return with the current investment expenditure. We identify conditions under which the optimal long-term contract induces larger investments and less reliance on the leading indicator variables as compared with short-term contracts. Under certain conditions, though, the principal does better with a sequence of one-period contracts than with a long-term contract.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1475-679X.2003.00125.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of performance measurement and contract theory without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue and demonstrate that the mere anticipation of group discussion can influence people's product attitudes. This occurs because anticipating discussion shifts people's focus toward the criteria dominating what they are mentally rehearsing to discuss. Such a shift is important because people commonly refer primarily to less important information when they explain or prepare to discuss their attitudes. Three studies demonstrate that when people are forming an attitude toward a product while anticipating discussion, this focus on less important information substantially affects people's attitudes toward the product. As a result, depending on the evaluative implications of what is rehearsed, anticipating group discussion can lead to attitudes that are more extreme, more moderate, or similar to those of people not anticipating discussion. Moreover, when the criteria predominantly rehearsed for discussion do not represent how consumers typically evaluate the products, attitudes affected by the group-anticipation context do not correspond to product judgments made outside of the group-anticipation context.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/1/101/1796175","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['consumer behavior', 'group interaction', 'attitudes']","The article focuses on consumer behavior and group dynamics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine the consequences of repeat purchasing (maintaining the status quo) versus switching in the context of information regarding the reason for the decision (e.g., prior consumption episode, brand history), and we argue that there are situations in which repeat purchasing may cause as much or even more regret than switching. We contend that this effect depends on whether or not there is a justifiable basis for the decision. In a series of four studies, we show that if there is sufficient motivation to warrant a switch, consumers will feel less regret in the face of a subsequent negative outcome realized via a switch than in one realized via a repeat purchase. Our results imply that feelings of regret are mitigated when the consumer reflects and concludes that the decision was appropriate under the circumstances.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/1/116/1796180","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on consumer decision-making processes and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In experiment 1, children gave equivalent evaluations of brand extensions regardless of category similarity (e.g., Coca-Cola extending to iced tea vs. toffee), whereas adults rated near extensions (e.g., iced tea) more favorably than far extensions (e.g., toffee). In experiment 2, children evaluated near extensions more favorably than far extensions when they were cued to make similarity judgments prior to evaluation but rated near and far extensions equivalently when they were not cued prior to evaluation. In experiment 3, children based their evaluations on the extension name's linguistic characteristics regardless of category similarity, whereas adults based their evaluations on category similarity regardless of name characteristics. Children rated extensions with a rhyming name (e.g., \u201cCoca-Cola Gola\u201d iced tea; \u201cWrigley's Higley\u201d toffee) more positively than extensions with a nonrhyming name (e.g., \u201cCoca-Cola Higley\u201d iced tea; \u201cWrigley's Gola\u201d toffee), whereas adults rated them similarly.

Most MDS models treat all brands the same regardless of their respective market share. In many product categories, however, consumer preferences are heavily influenced by the size of the existing market share (i.e., the brand mass). This article presents two versions of a new spatial methodology that incorporates the effects of brand as well as consumer mass via a spatial gravity model of consumer utility; that is, the attraction of a brand for a consumer depends not only on the distance of the brand from a consumer's ideal point but also on the current market size of the brand, as well as the consumer purchase pattern and volume. One version of the proposed model estimates brand positions and individual ideal points with two-way or three-way pick any/N binary choice data. The second version we develop provides the same spatial decomposition for two-way or three-way metric preference/dominance data. We also develop a series of nested MDS models to estimate, test, and compare four different model structures with respect to any common data set. We illustrate the proposed methodology using an actual commercial application involving physician prescription behavior and examine competing model fits.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/1/91/1796230","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for understanding consumer preferences without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this research we investigate the opposite form of self-control, whereby consumers force themselves to indulge and avoid default forms of spending on utilitarian necessities and/or savings. In particular, consumers who have difficulty choosing items that are perceived as indulgences or luxuries (e.g., a cruise) over necessities (e.g., saving for college education) and cash in everyday decisions may use precommitments to indulgence, especially when the psychological cost of such commitments is less concrete. These propositions were tested in a series of studies involving real and hypothetical choices as well as process measures. The results indicate that a substantial segment of consumers choose hedonic luxury rewards over cash of equal or greater value; consumers typically explain such choices based on the need to precommit to indulgence, to make sure that the award does not end up in the pool of money used for necessities. In addition, consistent with our analysis, the likelihood of precommitting to indulgence is enhanced when (a) the consequences of the decision will be realized farther in the future, (b) the odds of winning the reward are lower, and (c) consumers anticipate how they will use each possible award. We also show that awards representing indulgence are more effective than cash as incentives for participation in a (real) lottery.

Studies 1 and 2 indicate that consumers expect others to evaluate their decision more favorably if they choose variety and that this sometimes leads individuals to incorporate more variety into their public than private decisions. Results of study 2 confirm predictions that a relevant individual difference variable (self-monitoring) moderates the effects of expected evaluation on variety seeking. The final study demonstrates that pressure to choose variety in public is eliminated when a social cue signals the appropriateness of consuming one's favorites.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/2/246/1839988","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['variety', 'consumption', 'public scrutiny']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making without addressing themes of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As participants in both the dominant culture and their own subculture, members of subcultures are posited to possess knowledge of both groups. As such, their reactions to mainstream advertising are expected to be similar to those of members of the dominant culture. However, because members of the dominant culture are not as familiar with the subculture, their reactions to cues contained in subculture-targeted ads will differ from those of members of the subculture. Results of an experiment show that dominant culture source cues activate highly internalized dominant cultural models for all participants, leading to self-referencing and favorable ad attitudes.

Although this effect has been extensively documented under conditions of moderate to high processing involvement in the literature, its robustness in consumer environments may be overstated. Specifically, there are important differences between the experimental settings in which this effect has typically been obtained and marketplace conditions. For instance, subjects in past studies have typically evaluated unknown or hypothetical targets with the goal of forming an accurate impression. In the marketplace, consumers may be familiar with brands and likely to process brand-related information with a variety of other processing goals, such as impression and defense motivation. Using two experiments, this re-inquiry delineates conditions under which the negativity effect is likely to emerge and those under which it may be less likely to occur.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/2/270/1839997","re-inquiries","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the negativity effect in consumer psychology without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, relatively little is known about the relationship between materialism and well-being within the broader context of an individual's value system. In this article, we examine the relationship between material values and other important life values. In addition, we draw on values theory to examine a novel conceptualization of why materialism is antithetical to well-being. Specifically, our theory proposes that the individual orientation of material values conflicts with collective-oriented values, such as family values and religious values. This state of values conflict creates psychological tension, and this tension is associated with a reduced sense of well-being. Using both a survey sample of 373 adults from across the United States and an experimental study of 120 college students, we find considerable support for this conflicting values perspective.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/3/348/1800916","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['materialism', 'well-being', 'values', 'collective-oriented', 'psychological tension']","The article discusses the conflict between material values and collective-oriented values, which touches on themes of well-being and social values.

Results showed that making people feel part of an ad hoc group increased not only their use of equality as a basis for allocating resources to themselves and others, but also their tendency to compromise in individual consumer choice situations. Moreover, calling Asian and Western participants' attention to their cultural identity also induced feelings of being part of a group and, as a result, had analogous effects on decisions in both group and consumer choice situations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/29/3/400/1800945","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['cultural identity', 'group mind-set', 'equality', 'resource allocation', 'consumer choice']","The article discusses the impact of cultural identity on group dynamics and decision-making, emphasizing themes of equality and resource allocation, which align with social justice and DEI principles.

This research investigates consumers' affective experiences in a queue and their decisions to leave the queue after having spent some time in it (reneging). In particular, we find in our first two studies that, as the number of people behind increases, the consumer is in a relatively more positive affective state and the likelihood of reneging is lower. While a number of explanations may account for this effect, we focus on the role of social comparisons. In particular, we expect consumers in a queue to make downward comparisons with the less fortunate others behind them. We propose that three types of factors influence the degree of social comparisons made and thus moderate the effect of the number behind: (a) queue factors that influence the ease with which social comparisons can be made, (b) individual factors that determine the personal tendency to make social comparisons, and (c) situational factors that influence the degree of social comparisons through the generation of counterfactuals. Across three studies, we find support for each moderating effect.

Understanding this leveraging process requires understanding consumer brand knowledge and how it changes from such associations.

Initiated firms experience a five-day abnormal return of 4.1 percent versus 0.1 percent for firms with no coverage. The abnormal returns are concentrated in the days just before the quiet period expires. Abnormal returns are much larger when coverage is initiated by multiple analysts.

We test the comparative static predictions of our model. In contrast to previous work, we find that diversification is positively related to managerial incentives. Further, the link between firm performance and managerial incentives is weaker for firms that experience changes in diversification than it is for firms that do not.

We study the implications of jumps in prices and volatility on investment strategies. Using the event-risk framework of Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000), we provide analytical solutions to the optimal portfolio problem. Event risk dramatically affects the optimal strategy. An investor facing event risk is less willing to take leveraged or short positions. The investor acts as if some portion of his wealth may become illiquid and the optimal strategy blends both dynamic and buy-and-hold strategies.

This study avoids some of the complications encountered in previous empirical work by exploiting institutional characteristics of REITs, such as their limited discretion over dividend policy and the relative transparency of REIT assets. We regress the market value of equity on the market value of assets and tax basis, which creates tax deductions that lower future dividend taxes without affecting future pretax cash flow. We find that firm value is positively related to tax basis, suggesting that future dividend taxes are capitalized into share prices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00524","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the relationship between dividend taxes and firm valuation, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2003","58","1","Eitan Goldman,\u00a0\n                     Eitan GoldmanSearch for more papers by this authorSteve L.

We consider a sequence of managers, where each subsequent manager inherits the portfolio of their predecessor. We show that the inherited portfolio distorts the subsequent manager's incentive to trade on long-term information. This allows erroneous past information to persist, causing mispricing similar to a bubble. We investigate the magnitude of the mispricing. In addition, we examine endogenous information quality. In some cases, information quality increases when the manager's expected tenure decreases.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00525","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on investment decisions and mispricing, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes."],["2003","58","1","Harrison Hong,\u00a0\n                     Harrison HongSearch for more papers by this authorJeffrey D.

Controlling for accuracy, analysts who are optimistic relative to the consensus are more likely to experience favorable job separations. For analysts who cover stocks underwritten by their houses, job separations depend less on accuracy and more on optimism.

I show that when the covariance between real price/dividend ratios and inflation is nonzero, the relationship between returns and expected inflation differs for the two components of returns: dividend yields and capital gains returns.

This paper shows that underperformance is very likely to be observed ex-post in an efficient market. The premise is that more firms issue equity at higher stock prices even though they cannot predict future returns. Ex-post, issuers seem to time the market because offerings cluster at market peaks. Simulations based on 1973 through 1997 data reveal that when ex-ante expected abnormal returns are zero, median ex-post underperformance for equity issuers will be significantly negative in event-time.

We show that the regime shift in initial returns and other elements of pricing behavior can be at least partially accounted for by marked changes in pre-IPO ownership structure and insider selling behavior over the period, which reduced key decision makers' incentives to control underpricing. After controlling for these changes, the difference in underpricing between 1999 and 2000 and the preceding three years is much reduced. Our results suggest that it was firm characteristics that were unique during the \u201cdot-com bubble\u201d and that pricing behavior followed from incentives created by these characteristics.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00543","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO pricing and insider behavior during the dot-com bubble, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When implied volatilities are graphed against a standard measure of moneyness, the implied volatility smirk does not flatten out as maturity increases up to the observable horizon of two years. This behavior contrasts sharply with the implications of many pricing models and with the asymptotic behavior implied by the central limit theorem (CLT). We develop a parsimonious model which deliberately violates the CLT assumptions and thus captures the observed behavior of the volatility smirk over the maturity horizon. Calibration exercises demonstrate its superior performance against several widely used alternatives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00544","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of option pricing and does not address any social issues, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2003","58","2","Edwin J.

Funds with incentive fees exhibit positive stock selection ability, but a beta less than one results in funds not earning positive fees. From an investor's perspective, positive alphas plus lower expense ratios make incentive-fee funds attractive. However, incentive-fee funds take on more risk than non-incentive-fee funds, and they increase risk after a period of poor performance. Incentive fees are useful marketing tools, since more new cash flows go into incentive-fee funds than into non-incentive-fee funds, ceteris paribus.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00545","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of incentive fees and their impact on mutual fund performance without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2003","58","2","Ant\u00f3nio C\u00e2mara,\u00a0\n                     Ant\u00f3nio C\u00e2mara\n                     C\u00e2mara is from the Department of Accounting and Finance, Strathclyde University.

Those pricing results are particularly valuable (a) to show new sufficient conditions for existing risk-neutral option pricing equations (e.g., the Black-Scholes model), and (b) to obtain new analytical solutions for the price of European-style contingent claims when the underlying asset has a transformed normal distribution (e.g., a negatively skew lognormal distribution).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00546","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of option pricing and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We show that when financial constraints affect borrowing and lending between domestic agents, agents undervalue insuring against an exchange rate depreciation. Since more of this insurance is present when external debt is denominated in domestic currency rather than in dollars, this result implies that domestic agents choose excessive dollar debt. We also show that limited financial development reduces the incentives for foreign lenders to enter emerging markets.

Under centralized contracting, headquarters raises funds on behalf of multiple projects. Under decentralized contracting, each project raises funds separately on the external capital market. The benefit of centralization is that headquarters can use excess liquidity from high cash-flow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-flow projects. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash flows from several projects and self-finance follow-up investments without having to return to the capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, it is more difficult to force headquarters to make repayments, which tightens financing constraints ex ante.

Convertible securities can be used to endogenously allocate cash-flow rights as a function of the state of the world and the entrepreneur's effort. This property can be used to induce the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist to invest efficiently into the project. The result is robust to renegotiation and to changes in the timing of investments and information flows. The model is consistent with the observations that conversion is often automatic and that convertible securities are rarely used by outside investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00561","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of convertible securities in venture capital without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for 'wokeness'."],["2003","58","3","George Kanatas,\u00a0\n                     George KanatasKanatas is from the Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University, and Qi is from the College of Business Administration at the University of South Florida.

As the number of divisions increases, the free-rider problem is aggravated, and internal capital markets substitute for external capital markets in the provision of managerial incentives.

Although the trading activity of the Jardine Group moved to Singapore, the core businesses remained in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Evidence indicates the Jardine stocks are correlated less (more) with the Hong Kong (Singapore) market after the delisting.

We develop a likelihood-based estimation strategy and provide estimates of parameters, spot volatility, jump times, and jump sizes using S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index returns. Estimates of jump times, jump sizes, and volatility are particularly useful for identifying the effects of these factors during periods of market stress, such as those in 1987, 1997, and 1998. Using formal and informal diagnostics, we find strong evidence for jumps in volatility and jumps in returns.

An informed investor with limited investment capacity spreads imprecise rumors to an audience of followers. Followers trade on the advice and move the price. Due to the imprecision of the rumor, the price overshoots with positive probability. This gives the rumormonger the opportunity to trade twice: First when she receives information, then when she knows the price to be overshooting. In equilibrium, rumors are informative and both rumormongers and followers increase their profits at the expense of uninformed liquidity traders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00575","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of information diffusion and trading behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we find substantial momentum (reversals) in consecutive weekly returns when the latter week has unexpectedly high (low) turnover. This pattern is evident in equity indices, index futures, and individual stocks. Similarly, we also find that the autocorrelation in equity-index returns is increasing with the unexpected dispersion across the latter week's firm-level returns. Weeks with extreme turnover and dispersion shocks (both high and low) tend to have more macroeconomic news releases. Our findings bear on understanding price formation and the economic interpretation of turnover and dispersion shocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00576","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock returns and trading volume without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In support, we find that market risk has little effect on the use of stock-based pay for the average executive. But executives' ability to \u201cundo\u201d excessive market risk can be hindered by wealth constraints and inalienability of human capital.

ADR dividends are often subject to foreign withholding taxes, creating incentives for certain investors to avoid the distribution. ADRs exhibit negative abnormal ex-dividend day returns, and their prices behave consistently with their related withholding taxes. Abnormal trading volume for taxable issues exceeds 130 percent and 300 percent of normal volume on the cum- and ex-dates, respectively. Abnormal volume is an increasing function of foreign withholding tax rates and decreasing function of transactions costs. This abnormal ex-date trading activity is consistent with tax-motivated trading.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00578","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of tax-induced trading in equity securities without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or diversity themes.

In that case, imposing no-short-sale constraints should hurt, whereas empirical evidence is often to the contrary. We reconcile this apparent contradiction. We explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are wrong. Surprisingly, with no-short-sale constraints in place, the sample covariance matrix performs as well as covariance matrix estimates based on factor models, shrinkage estimators, and daily data.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00580","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio management and risk reduction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The market-to-book ratio (M/B) increases with uncertainty about average profitability, especially for firms that pay no dividends. M/B is predicted to decline over a firm's lifetime due to learning, with steeper decline when the firm is young. These predictions are confirmed empirically. Data also support the predictions that younger stocks and stocks that pay no dividends have more volatile returns. Firm profitability has become more volatile recently, helping explain the puzzling increase in average idiosyncratic return volatility observed over the past few decades.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00587","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock valuation and profitability without addressing any social issues, ethical considerations, or progressive themes.

We find that, cross-sectionally, a dealer with longer (shorter) risk exposure sells (buys) a larger amount of exposure the next day. However, this risk control takes place via the futures market and not the spot market.

We find a significant market reaction to the information contained in analysts' target prices, both unconditionally and conditional on contemporaneously issued stock recommendation and earnings forecast revisions. Using a cointegration approach, we analyze the long-term behavior of market and target prices. We find that, on average, the one-year-ahead target price is 28 percent higher than the current market price.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00593","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical analysis of market reactions and target prices without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

We examine the propensity of these strategies to generate statistically and economically significant profits due to our familiarity with the data. Under plausible assumptions, data snooping can account for up to 50 percent of the in-sample relations between firm characteristics and returns uncovered using single (one-way) sorts.

We show this to be consistent with fund incentives, because funds discard exactly those strategies which underperform. Past returns tell less about the future performance of funds which discard, so flows are less sensitive to them when they are poor. Our model predicts that strategy changes only occur after bad performance, and that bad performers who change strategy have dollar flow and future performance that are less sensitive to current performance than those that do not. Empirical tests support both predictions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00596","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fund performance and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Without moral hazard, it is optimal that both exert effort. With moral hazard, if the entrepreneur's effort is more efficient (less costly) than the advisor's effort, the latter is not hired if she does not provide funds. Outside financing arises endogenously. This explains why investors like venture capitalists are value enhancing. The level of outside financing determines whether common stocks or convertible bonds should be issued in response to incentives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00597","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial contracts and investment productivity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, previous empirical research has not found systematic evidence supporting the wealth expropriation hypothesis. Using a larger sample with comprehensive bond data, we find evidence consistent with wealth expropriation. Bondholders, on average, suffer a significant negative abnormal return during the month of the spin-off announcement. However, even accounting for the loss to the bondholders, the aggregate value of the publicly traded debt and equity increases on a spin-off announcement, suggesting that the wealth expropriation hypothesis is not a complete explanation of the stockholder gains. In explaining the magnitude of the losses to bondholders, we find they are a function of the loss in collateral in the spun-off subsidiary and the level of financial risk of the parent firm. Consistent with a loss to bondholders, firms are more likely to have their credit rating downgraded than upgraded after a spin-off. Additionally, consistent with the wealth transfer hypothesis, losses to bondholders tend to be more severe, the larger the gains to shareholders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00598","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on financial metrics and wealth transfer between bondholders and stockholders without addressing social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In existing models, a firm's choice of financial instruments deters entry by affecting product market behavior; here entry deterrence occurs by affecting the credit market behavior of investors towards entrant firms. We find that to deter entry, the claims held on incumbent firms should be sufficiently risky, that is, equity. This contrasts with the standard Brander and Lewis (1986) result that debt deters entry. This effect is more marked the less competitive the credit market is\u2014so more credit market competition spurs more product market competition.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00599","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial modeling and market behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The increase appears to be related to Rule 10b-21 and to economic changes affecting both IPOs and SEOs. Consistent with temporary price pressure, underpricing is positively related to offer size especially for securities with relatively inelastic demand. Underpricing is also positively related to price uncertainty and, after Rule 10b-21, to the magnitude of preoffer returns. Additionally, I find that underpricing is significantly related to underwriter pricing conventions such as price rounding and pricing relative to the bid quote.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00604","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of underpricing in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2003","58","6","John M.

The lack of a complementary variation between minimum bank capital requirements and regulatory forbearance leads to a spillover from more forbearing to less forbearing economies and reduces the competitive advantage of banks in less forbearing economies.

When performance-maximization is not the only game in town","his is a first attempt to study how the structure of the industry affects mutual fund behavior.

I argue that this option acts as an externality for all the funds belonging to the same family, affecting the target level of performance the family wants to reach and the number of funds it wants to set up.By using the universe of the U.S. mutual fund industry, I empirically confirm this intuition. I find evidence of family driven heterogeneity among funds and show that families actively exploit it. I argue that the more families are able to differentiate themselves in terms of non-performance-related characteristics, the less they need to compete in terms of performance. Product differentiation\u2014i.e., the dispersion in the \u201cservices\u201d (fees, performance) that the competing funds offer\u2014affects performance and fund proliferation.

Allowing for additional flexibility beyond a constant term in the drift provides negligible benefit. While constant drift would appear to imply that the short rate is nonstationary, in fact, stationarity is volatility-induced. The simple constant elasticity of volatility model fits weekly observations of the three-month Treasury bill rate remarkably well but is easily rejected when compared with more flexible volatility specifications over daily data. The methodology of Durham and Gallant can also be used to estimate stochastic volatility models.

Our econometric analysis uses a two-stage estimation procedure. In the first stage, the probability that a country is an FDI recipient is estimated. The results indicate that countries that fail to achieve a minimum threshold of effective governance are unlikely to receive any US FDI. Countries that receive no US FDI are typically countries that do not promote free and transparent markets, that have ineffective governments, and that often have legal systems that are not rooted in English common law. In the second stage, the analysis is restricted to those countries that did receive FDI flows. The estimated equations focus on the determinants of the amount of FDI received.

Our results suggest that the synergy gains stemming from the internalization of markets are rooted in the core business of the firm. Geographic diversification outside the core business of the firm bears strongly against the prediction of the internalization hypothesis. The analysis also shows that, regardless of the industrial structure of the firm (that is, number of segments), foreign direct investments outside the core business of the firm are associated with a loss in shareholder value, whereas core-related (focused) foreign direct investments are found to be value increasing. Unrelated international diversification, however, is less harmful for diversified (multi-segment) than specialized (single-segment) firms.

During this period, Japanese automobile assemblers began to produce vehicles in North America, and began to purchase inputs from US auto-component manufacturers. Those US manufacturers that sold components to Japanese transplants would be the direct recipients of any technologies transferred from the Japanese. Although we find that the direct investment by Japanese assemblers was associated with overall productivity improvement in the US auto-component industry, we find little evidence of direct technology transfer. The productivity growth of US suppliers affiliated with Japanese assemblers was no greater than that of other, non-affiliated US suppliers. Further, we find that the Japanese assemblers tended to purchase components from less productive US suppliers and, moreover, that low-productivity suppliers that sold goods to Japanese assemblers had a higher survival rate than low-productivity suppliers that did not sell to Japanese firms.

The results show that natural selection and strategic choice have a role to play, even when controlling for each other.

Although the business and institutional environments do have a significant influence on the performance of cross-border affiliates in a transition economy, performance can be improved through strategic managerial action. In particular, leveraging local resources by developing trust between parent and affiliate, and maintaining close control and integration with the parent, are associated with enhanced performance.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400033","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on theoretical frameworks related to performance in cross-border operations without addressing any socially progressive themes or issues related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2003","34","4","D Sethi1, S E Guisinger2, S E Phelan2 & \u2026D M Berg3","Trends in foreign direct investment flows: a theoretical and empirical analysis","This paper seeks to provide a rationale for changing trends in the flow and determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a result of macro-economic and firm strategy considerations.

More recently, research from a \u2018knowledge-based\u2019 perspective has addressed the role of tacitness in constraining a firm's ability to transfer knowledge internationally. We combine these perspectives to describe how knowledge tacitness affects the relative suitability of four archetypal entry modes: exporting, licensing, establishing an alliance, and wholly owned entry. We then examine and develop conceptually a seldom-studied firm characteristic, knowledge transfer capacity. We offer predictions that describe the combined effects of knowledge tacitness and transfer capacity on entry mode choice. We distinguish between the transfer capacity of the organization that develops knowledge (source transfer capacity) and that of the organization that seeks to access that knowledge (recipient transfer capacity). The discussion addresses how our model generalizes to knowledge-seeking strategies and to the study of ongoing multinational networks.

The authors address this issue by examining the effect that shifts in strategic emphasis have on stock return. They find that the stock market reacts favorably when a firm increases its emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation. This effect, however, is moderated by firm and industry characteristics, in particular, financial performance, the past level of strategic emphasis of the firm, and the technological environment in which the firm operates.

What are the factors that influence the choice of such strategies? Does industry type matter? The authors introduce and operationalize the concept of corporate environmentalism in an effort to answer these questions. Using stakeholder theory, the authors identify four important antecedents to corporate environmentalism, namely, public concern, regulatory forces, competitive advantage, and top management commitment. The authors then use a political\u2013economic framework to develop testable hypotheses. To test the hypotheses, the authors perform multigroup path analysis on data gathered from more than 240 firms. They find that corporate environmentalism is related to all hypothesized antecedents and that industry type moderates several of those relationships.

The results show that a few journals wield a disproportionate amount of influence in the marketing journal network as a whole and that influential journals tend to derive their influence from many different journals. Different journals are most influential in different subareas of marketing; general business and managerially oriented journals have lost influence, whereas more specialized marketing journals have gained in influence over time. The Journal of Marketing emerges as the most influential marketing journal in the final period (1996\u201397) and as the journal with the broadest span of influence across all subareas. Yet the Journal of Marketing is notably influential among applied marketing journals, which themselves are of lesser influence. The index of structural influence is significantly correlated with other objective and subjective measures of influence but least so with the impact factors reported in the Social Sciences Citation Index.

The authors use two experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products. In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information.

The authors examine the process through which critics affect box office revenue, that is, whether they influence the decision of the film going public (their role as influencers), merely predict the decision (their role as predictors), or do both. They find that both positive and negative reviews are correlated with weekly box office revenue over an eight-week period, suggesting that critics play a dual role: They can influence and predict box office revenue. However, the authors find the impact of negative reviews (but not positive reviews) to diminish over time, a pattern that is more consistent with critics\u2019 role as influencers. The authors then compare the positive impact of good reviews with the negative impact of bad reviews to find that film reviews evidence a negativity bias; that is, negative reviews hurt performance more than positive reviews help performance, but only during the first week of a film's run. Finally, the authors examine two key moderators of critical reviews, stars and budgets, and find that popular stars and big budgets enhance box office revenue for films that receive more negative critical reviews than positive critical reviews but do little for films that receive more positive reviews than negative reviews.

(2) How great are the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards vary across dominant and nondominant firms?

The authors examine the effects of ambient scent on recall and recognition of brands in two studies. In the first (i.e., encoding) phase of each study, subjects are asked to evaluate familiar and unfamiliar brands while viewing digital photographs of products on a computer screen; stimulus viewing times are measured covertly on the computer. Ambient scent is manipulated in the experiment room through a diffuser. In the second (i.e., retrieval) phase, conducted 24-hours later, brand recall and recognition accuracy are assessed. In both studies, ambient scent improves both recall and recognition of familiar and unfamiliar brands.

The psychophysics of pricing suggests that changes in monetary magnitude are not based on their absolute level, but rather on their deviation from some reference level, or how the change is \u201cframed.\u201d Often, however, a promotion is presented in nonmonetary terms (e.g., a premium). When two resources are delivered simultaneously, but in different currencies (e.g., receive a free razor with the purchase of a can of shaving cream), the marginal value of the nonmonetary, incremental benefit may be difficult to evaluate in relation to the focal product or its price. Therefore, the value of the premium may be less likely than a comparable discount to be viewed in a relative sense and thus less likely to suffer from diminishing marginal returns. This research explores how people often fail to exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to an incremental benefit, or cost, when it is accrued in a currency other than the referent currency. The authors define two different carriers of wealth or welfare (i.e., resources) that are difficult to convert into any meaningful common unit of measurement as \u201cincommensurate.\u201d This research introduces a novel mechanism for influencing whether people attend to absolute rather than relative differences.

To determine the appropriate number of entries in a specific firm's product line, the author develops a model that balances the benefits of increased revenue from a broad product line against production and engineering costs. Two innovations were central in the development of the model: (1) redefining how products are scored on various product attributes so that attribute scores vary normally across the population of products and (2) redefining how the number of entries in a product portfolio is calculated in order to discount the significance of entries that are highly similar to existing products. The author also introduces the notion of a centroid time to more easily adjust sales and total development costs for product life cycle and investment life cycle effects. These redefinitions enable a firm's profit to be modeled as a simple function of its effective number of product entries, the effective number of competitors entries, the total sales in the segment, variable profits adjusted for capacity constraints, and product development costs. This leads to a simple expression for the profit-maximizing number of effective entries, both when competitor portfolios are fixed and when competitors dynamically adjust their portfolios. The author illustrates how to estimate and apply the model on a realistic example.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.40.1.39.19126","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of product portfolio management and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this article, the authors develop a framework to examine bargaining between channel members and demonstrate that the bargaining process actually affects the degree of coordination and that two-part tariffs will not be part of the market contract even in a simple one manufacturer-one retailer channel. To establish the institutional and theoretical bases for these results, the authors relax the conventional assumption that the product being exchanged is completely specifiable in a contract. They show that the institution of bargaining has force, and it affects channel coordination when the complexity of nonspecifiability of the product exchange is present. The authors find that greater retailer power promotes channel coordination. Thus, there are conditions in which the presence of a powerful retailer might actually be beneficial to all channel members. The authors recover the standard double-marginalization take-it-or-leave-it offer outcome as a particular case of the bargaining process.

The model can be employed for any bundle, regardless of the heterogeneity of bundle components, under a pure bundling strategy. The conjoint model and balance model are special cases of the general model. The authors use mixture distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in a more flexible manner than the extant approaches such as latent-class and random-coefficient models. The empirical tests of the model show that most attribute effects are significant and consistent with the model's predictions. The model is superior to those that do not consider the issues of comparability of attributes, latent-class structure, and heterogeneity among respondents.

An implicit assumption in the experimental practice of forcing choice is that the no-choice option draws proportionately from the various available alternatives, such that the qualitative conclusions are unaffected. However, the authors propose that the no-choice option competes most directly with alternatives that buyers tend to select when they are uncertain about their preferences. Building on this general proposition, the authors show that the introduction of the no-choice option strengthens the attraction effect, weakens the compromise effect, and decreases the relative share of an option that is \u201caverage\u201d on all dimensions. They also examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of having the option not to choose and the conditions under which the no-choice option is likely to affect relative option shares.

The authors present two experiments that examine the effect of brand equity on consumer valuation of such trivial attributes and the reciprocal effect that such a strategy may have on brand equity. The results show that both high and low equity brands benefit from offering an attractive trivial attribute in the absence of a disclosure of its true value. However, prechoice disclosure of an attribute's triviality heightens the role of the brand and context cues. Competing low equity brands benefit by sharing the trivial attribute with a higher equity brand, whereas competing high equity brands benefit from uniquely offering a trivial attribute. Postchoice revelation that an attribute is trivial hurts the subsequent ability of a low but not a high equity brand to differentiate in a new product category, particularly among subjects who had previously chosen the target brand.

The author finds that signaling can limit a seller's ability to screen, especially when buyers are willing to pay a significant premium for higher quality.

In this article, the authors examine this \u201cexpropriation\u201d scenario but also consider whether specific investments, because of their specialized nature, may actually \u201cbond\u201d the receiver and reduce opportunism under certain conditions. These conditions involve a focal relationship's time horizon (i.e., its extendedness) and particular norms.

Almost all applications of the models in marketing rely on segment retention criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, consistent Akaike's information criterion, and information complexity to determine the number of latent segments to retain. Because these applications employ real-world data in which the true number of segments is unknown, it is not clear whether these criteria are effective. Retaining the true number of segments is crucial because many product design and marketing decisions depend on it. The purpose of this extensive simulation study is to determine how well commonly used segment retention criteria perform in the context of simulated multinomial choice data, as obtained from supermarket scanner panels, in which the true number of segments is known. The authors find that an Akaike's information criterion with a penalty factor of three rather than the traditional value of two has the highest segment retention success rate across nearly all experimental conditions. Currently, this criterion is rarely, if ever, applied in the marketing literature. Experimental factors of particular interest in marketing contexts, such as the number of choices per household, the number of choice alternatives, the error variance of the choices, and the minimum segment size, have not been considered in the statistics literature.

Two basic aspects of browsing behavior are examined: (1) the visitor's decisions to continue browsing (by submitting an additional page request) or to exit the site and (2) the length of time spent viewing each page. The authors propose a type II tobit model that captures both aspects of browsing behavior and handles the limitations of server log-file data. The authors fit the model to the individual-level browsing decisions of a random sample of 5000 visitors to the Web site of an Internet automotive company. Empirical results show that visitors' propensity to continue browsing changes dynamically as a function of the depth of a given site visit and the number of repeat visits to the site. The dynamics are consistent both with \u201cwithin-site lock-in\u201d or site \u201cstickiness\u201d and with learning that carries over repeat visits. In particular, repeat visits lead to reduced page-view propensities but not to reduced page-view durations. The results also reveal browsing patterns that may reflect visitors' time-saving strategies. Finally, the authors report that simple site metrics computed at the aggregate level diverge substantially from individual-level modeling results, which indicates the need for Web site analyses to control for cross-sectional heterogeneity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.40.3.249.19241","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of web browsing behavior using clickstream data without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, the role of synergy in multimedia communications is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how advertisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multimedia communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive theoretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspending. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.40.4.375.19385","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising synergy without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article examines whether brand-switching elasticities derived from these models are overestimated as a result of rational consumer adjustment of purchase timing to coincide with promotion schedules and whether a dynamic structural model can address this bias. Using simulated data, the authors first show that if the structural model is correct, brand-switching elasticities are overestimated by stand-alone logit models. A nested logit model improves the estimates, but not completely. Second, the authors estimate the models on real data. The results indicate that the structural model fits better and produces sensible coefficient estimates. The authors then observe the same pattern in switching elasticities as they do in the simulation. Third, the authors predict sales assuming a 50% increase in promotion frequency. The reduced-form models predict much higher sales levels than does the dynamic structural model. The authors conclude that reduced-form model estimates of brand-switching elasticities can be overstated and that a dynamic structural model is best for addressing the problem. Reduced-form models that include incidence can partially, though not completely, address the issue.

In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the \u201cidiosyncratic fit heuristic,\u201d whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.40.4.454.19383","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['consumer response', 'loyalty programs', 'effort advantage']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and loyalty programs without addressing any social justice themes or ethical critiques.

In the basic model, it is assumed that for each commodity, the flow can be routed on any path connecting its origin and its destination. In telecommunication applications, where a commodity represents a communication pair, there are often additional time-delay or reliability requirements on paths that are used for routing. These requirements may vary by communication pair, represented by different priority classes. In this paper, we extend the basic multicommodity network-flow model to include such side constraints on paths. The extended problem is NP-hard with the constrained shortest-path problem as a special case. To solve the extended model, we use a column-generation approach, in which the solution is built up successively by path generation. The side constraints are efficiently handled in the path-generation subproblem. We further discuss various enhancements of this approach. Computational results show that the column-generation approach provides an efficient way for solving the extended model, even for fairly large networks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.15.1.42.15151","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to network-flow optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although the web is growing exponentially, the individual's capacity to read and digest content is essentially fixed. The full economic potential of the web will not be realized unless enabling technologies are provided to facilitate access to web resources. Currently web personalization is the most promising approach to remedy this problem, and web mining, particularly web-usage mining, is considered a crucial component of any efficacious web-personalization system. In this paper, we describe a complete framework for web-usage mining to satisfy the challenging requirements of web-personalization applications. For online and anonymous web personalization to be effective, web usage mining must be accomplished in real time as accurately as possible. On the other hand, web-usage mining should allow a compromise between scalability and accuracy to be applicable to real-life websites with numerous visitors. Within our web-usage-mining framework, we introduce a distributed user-tracking approach for accurate, scalable, and implicit collection of the usage data. We also propose a new model, the feature-matrices (FM) model, to discover and interpret users' access patterns. With FM, various spatial and temporal features of usage data can be captured with flexible precision so that we can trade off accuracy for scalability based on the specific application requirements. Moreover, tunable complexity of the FM model allows real-time and adaptive access pattern discovery from usage data. We define a novel similarity measure based on FM that is specifically designed for accurate classification of partial navigation patterns in real time.

In particular, errors in the reconstruction of sessions and incomplete tracing of users\u2019 activities in a site can easily result in invalid patterns and wrong conclusions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of heuristics employed to reconstruct sessions from the server log data. Such heuristics are called to partition activities first by user and then by visit of the user in the site, where user identification mechanisms, such as cookies, may or may not be available. We propose a set of performance measures that are sensitive to two types of reconstruction errors and appropriate for different applications in knowledge discovery (KDD) applications. We have tested our framework on the Web server data of a frame-based Web site. The first experiment concerned a specific KDD application and has shown the sensitivity of the heuristics to particularities of the site's structure and traffic.

However, the best search engines index only approximately 20% of the static pages. So the real question is: While the Web is certainly the most amazing and comprehensive information source ever created, are you really getting all the information you need for your specific purpose? The answer to this question is mostly \u201cyes\u201d for the individual user, who uses the Web as an information source for casual purposes. However, for an individual who uses the Web as an essential and comprehensive source of information\u2014for business or research\u2014the answer is quite the opposite. Even a sophisticated Web user requires a significant amount of time and effort to find all of the information needed for a given task. In this paper the concept of Web Business Intelligence (WBI) is introduced, an emerging class of software that leverages the unprecedented content on the Web to extract actionable knowledge in an organizational setting. The contributions include an architecture for WBI, a survey of technologies relevant to the various components of the architecture, and illustration of the value of WBI by means of a detailed example from the e-finance domain.

This paper proposes a relationship-based approach that alleviates both problems, side-stepping the \u201ccurse of-dimensionality\u201d issue by working in a suitable similarity space instead of the original high-dimensional attribute space. This intermediary similarity space can be suitably tailored to satisfy business criteria such as requiring customer clusters to represent comparable amounts of revenue. We apply efficient and scalable graph-partitioning-based clustering techniques in this space. The output from the clustering algorithm is used to re-order the data points so that the resulting permuted similarity matrix can be readily visualized in two dimensions, with clusters showing up as bands. While two-dimensional visualization of a similarity matrix is by itself not novel, its combination with the order-sensitive partitioning of a graph that captures the relevant similarity measure between objects provides three powerful properties: (i) the high-dimensionality of the data does not affect further processing once the similarity space is formed; (ii) it leads to clusters of (approximately) equal importance, and (iii) related clusters show up adjacent to one another, further facilitating the visualization of results. The visualization is very helpful for assessing and improving clustering. For example, actionable recommendations for splitting or merging of clusters can be easily derived, and it also guides the user toward the right number of clusters. Results are presented on a real retail industry dataset of several thousand customers and products, as well as on clustering of web-document collections and of web-log sessions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.15.2.208.14448","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data mining and clustering techniques without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This NP-hard problem has applications that include job scheduling, routing, loading for flexible manufacturing systems, and facility location. Due to the difficulty in solving \u201chard\u201d GAPs to optimality, most recent papers either describe heuristic methods for generating \u201cgood\u201d solutions or, in the case of optimizing methods, computational results are limited to 500 to 1,000 binary variables. In this paper we describe a special purpose branch-and-bound algorithm that utilizes linear programming cuts, feasible-solution generators, Lagrangean relaxation, and subgradient optimization. We present computational results for solving \u201chard\u201d problems with up to 3,000 binary variables. An unanticipated benefit of the algorithm is its ability to generate good feasible solutions early in the process whose solution quality generally dominates the solutions generated by two recently published heuristics. Furthermore, the computation time required is often less than the time taken by the heuristics. Thus, we have an optimizing algorithm that can be used quite effectively as a heuristic when proof of optimality is not an absolute requirement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.15.3.249.16075","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical optimization problem without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this approach an initial solution is first created using new route-construction heuristics followed by a route-elimination procedure to improve the solutions regarding the number of vehicles. In the third phase the solutions are improved in terms of total traveled distance using four new local-search procedures proposed in this paper.

As a result, very little work on the formal development of simulation graph models directly considers an event-canceling construct. However, to the simulation practitioner, the modeling convenience and functionality provided by a canceling construct is important. This is clearly demonstrated by the presence of some sort of event-canceling construct in all the major simulation software packages. This paper extends the simulation graph modeling framework to include a general approach to handling event cancellation. The extension is provided in algorithmic form.

Except for some boundary levels, the rates of the events are independent of the level, and no event can change X1, X2, or X1 + X2 by more than 1. In this case, the eigenvectors are essentially Sturm sequences, which implies that all eigenvalues are real. The properties of the Sturm sequences allow us to design an extension of the binary search to find all eigenvalues. As it turns out, once the interval containing an eigenvalue is narrowed down sufficiently, it is preferable to use Newton's method. A computational-complexity study indicates that the resulting algorithm should be signicantly faster than matrix-iterative methods.

To respond, manufacturers are seeking to enhance flexibility across the value chain. Manufacturing flexibility, a critical dimension of value chain flexibility, is the ability to produce a variety of products in the quantities that customers demand while maintaining high performance. It is strategically important for enhancing competitive position and winning customer orders.\n            \n            This research organizes literature on manufacturing flexibility and classifies it according to competence and capability theory. It describes a framework to explore the relationships among flexible competence (machine, labor, material handling, and routing flexibilities), flexible capability (volume flexibility and mix flexibility), and customer satisfaction. It develops valid and reliable instruments to measure the sub-dimensions of manufacturing flexibility, and it applies structural equation modeling to a large-scale sample (n=273). The results indicate strong, positive, and direct relationships between flexible manufacturing competence and volume flexibility and between flexible manufacturing competence and mix flexibility. Volume flexibility and mix flexibility have strong, positive, and direct relationships with customer satisfaction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900067-0","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing flexibility and customer satisfaction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Empirical evidence from four operational failure case studies offers an opportunity to revise and extend the initial model. Specific conclusions address the structural and temporal pathology of operational failure and the subjective \u2018layers\u2019 of internal and external loss that appear to influence overall negative consequences. Additionally, effective risk control is highlighted as an integrated process with more similarities to service quality management than variation-reduction process control.

While there have been numerous success stories, the amount of reported failures has been extremely high. In spite of all the recent failures, a select few organizations have been able to use e-commerce as a means to increase the overall profitability of their firm. An often-overlooked factor in website effectiveness and development is the effect of individual user differences on the acceptance of the new technology. This exploratory study examines how individual user views and preferences affect the use of the Internet as a purchasing medium.\n            \n            This research presents an exploratory study of data gathered through a survey of 416 customers of a major Internet retailer of commodity office supplies. Cluster analysis is employed to develop a model that classifies users of Internet purchasing into six distinct groups. The clusters are developed using a variety of items that measure end users\u2019 viewpoints and preferences regarding the Internet as a purchasing medium. These factors are based on the widely supported Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The classification system is then used to demonstrate how these groups vary on strategic items, cost issues and individual productivity measures. The findings provide important insights to companies seeking to capitalize on the Internet as a retailing channel by identifying factors that may lead to a loyal customer base rather than an opportunistic one that switches sites frequently solely to obtain lower prices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900089-X","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of Internet purchasing and user preferences without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

No unequivocal answer to this question can be found in the literature. Some think that globalization exposes all the limits of local industrial systems. Others consider the contraposition between global and local to be only apparent. There could be, however, a clear relation between the firm\u2019s competitiveness on the international market and its territorial roots. The present paper focuses on one of the most important local systems in Italy, i.e. the eyewear district. Based on empirical research, the study analyzes the evolution of the eyewear industry, the strategies used by the larger producers to face the current competitive challenges and the consequences of such actions on the local supply system. It is shown that the district has lost most of its traditional features and inter-organizational relations have significantly changed. Opportunities arising from new technologies and global economy seem to favor better equipped, large-sized enterprises rather than small suppliers, or in any case, single units or groups rather than the system. Finally, some suggestions are provided for entrepreneurs or managers operating in industrial districts, concerning vertical integration and sourcing choices (main-contracting firms), and technological and managerial levers that could better qualify the supply offer (sub-contracting firms).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900090-6","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['local manufacturing', 'global economy', 'competitiveness', 'supply system']","The article discusses the relationship between local manufacturing systems and the global economy, touching on competitiveness and the impact on local supply systems.

This paper examines the effects of three contextual factors, plant size, plant age and unionization status, on the likelihood of implementing 22 manufacturing practices that are key facets of lean production systems. Further, we postulate four \u201cbundles\u201d of inter-related and internally consistent practices; these are just-in-time (JIT), total quality management (TQM), total preventive maintenance (TPM), and human resource management (HRM). We empirically validate our bundles and investigate their effects on operational performance. The study sample uses data from IndustryWeek\u2019s Census of Manufacturers. The evidence provides strong support for the influence of plant size on lean implementation, whereas the influence of unionization and plant age is less pervasive than conventional wisdom suggests. The results also indicate that lean bundles contribute substantially to the operating performance of plants, and explain about 23% of the variation in operational performance after accounting for the effects of industry and contextual factors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900108-0","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['unionization', 'human resource management', 'operational performance']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of lean manufacturing and operational performance, with only a minor mention of unionization and human resource management, which are not central to the discussion of social justice or equity.

Prior research has focused on the need for such activities, while current research tries to identify those components that encourage or discourage such activities. As a result of the introduction of ISO 14001, attention has turned to corporate environmental management systems (EMS). The underlying assumption is that such a system is critical to a firm\u2019s ability to reduce waste and pollution while simultaneously improving overall performance. This study evaluates this assumption. Drawing on data provided by a survey of North American managers, their attitudes toward EMS and ISO 14001, this study assesses the relative effects of having a formal but uncertified EMS compared to having a formal, certified system. The results strongly demonstrate that firms in possession of a formal EMS perceive impacts well beyond pollution abatement and see a critical positive impact on many dimensions of operations performance. The results also show that firms having gone through EMS certification experience a greater impact on performance than do firms that have not certified their EMS.

The paper takes a contingency approach to explore the factors that impact production planning and control for closed-loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery. A series of three cases are presented, and a framework developed that shows the common activities required for all remanufacturing operations. To build on the similarities and illustrate and integrate the differences in closed-loop supply chains, Hayes and Wheelwright\u2019s product\u2013process matrix is used as a foundation to examine the three cases representing Remanufacture-to-Stock (RMTS), Reassemble-to-Order (RATO), and Remanufacture-to-Order (RMTO). These three cases offer end-points and an intermediate point for closed-loop supply operations. Since they represent different positions on the matrix, characteristics such as returns volume, timing, quality, product complexity, test and evaluation complexity, and remanufacturing complexity are explored. With a contingency theory for closed-loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery in place, past cases can now be reexamined and the potential for generalizability of the approach to similar types of other problems and applications can be assessed and determined.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900110-9","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['closed-loop', 'product recovery', 'remanufacturing']","The article discusses closed-loop supply chains and product recovery, which touch on sustainability themes but lack a strong focus on social justice or equity.

Based on a sample of matched pairs of manufacturing managers and general managers from 98 manufacturing plants, the hypotheses regarding the alignment\u2013performance relationship are tested. Specifically, we tested whether the performance of the manufacturing unit is enhanced when general managers and manufacturing managers agree on strategic priorities.

While previous research suggests that supply chain integration is directly related to superior business performance, the mediating role of manufacturing capabilities has not been explored. Using hierarchical regression analysis, we develop and test a theory-based model using a sample of consumer products manufacturers. Contrary to Frohlich and Westbrook\u2019s [J.

The results are based on a sample of 519 glitches announcements made during 1989\u20132000. Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market-wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market\u2019s reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market\u2019s reaction to pre-1995 and post-1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt\u2013equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market\u2019s reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2003.02.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the financial impacts of supply chain glitches on shareholder wealth without addressing any social, ethical, or diversity themes.

A survey of the 20 plants in the population was conducted via postal questionnaire between July 1999 and April 2001, with a structured interview being held at a later date. A cluster analysis was performed which allowed a taxonomy with three groups of plants to be established: traditionalists, designers and investors. These three groups differ from each other with regard to their AMT investments, industrial activity, size and degree of integration. Differences between the groups in company performance cannot be appreciated. Although the results apparently seem to back up most of the findings of previous works biased to larger companies, they do bring certain aspects into question regarding the explanation for the way the groups are formed. The three critical factors which determine AMT investment in the sector are the company\u2019s being of a certain minimum size, undergoing a period of expansion, and type of activity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2003.03.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on advanced manufacturing technology investment behaviors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Survey-based research was carried out to test this theory. Following questionnaire development, validation, and pretest with a pilot study, data were collected from the CEO, the CFO, and the CIO to measure the institutional pressures they faced and their intentions to adopt financial electronic data interchange (FEDI).

Together these variable sets explain a considerable proportion of variance in intended behavior.

We develop a conceptual model of satisfaction with ASP and empirically test the predictions using data from 256 firms using ASP services.  Expectations about ASP service have a significant influence on the performance evaluation of ASPs, and experience-based norms have only limited significance in explaining satisfaction with ASP.

User-centered information studies have relied on individualistic cognitive models to carefully examine the criteria that influence the selection of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that people make.  In many ways, these studies have improved our understanding of how a good information resource fits the people who use it.  However, research approaches based on an individualistic user concept are limited.  \n\nIn this paper, we examine the theoretical constructs that shape this user concept and contrast these with alternative views that help to reconceptualize the user as a social actor.  Despite pervasive ICT use, social actors are not primarily users of ICTs.  Most people who use ICT applications utilize multiple applications, in various roles, and as part of their efforts to produce goods and services while interacting with a variety of other people, and often in multiple social contexts.  Moreover, the socially thin user construct limits our understanding of information selection, manipulation, communication, and exchange within complex social contexts. Using analyses from a recent study of online information service use, we develop an institutionalist concept of a social actor whose everyday interactions are infused with ICT use. We then encourage a shift from the user concept to a concept of the social actor in IS research.  We suggest that such a shift will sharpen perceptions of how organizational contexts shape ICT-related practices, and at the same time will help researchers more accurately portray the complex and multiple roles that people fulfill while adopting, adapting, and using information systems.","https://misq.umn.edu/reconceptualizing-users-as-social-actors-in-information-systems-research.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","6","['social actors', 'social contexts', 'information selection', 'institutionalist']","The article emphasizes the need to reconceptualize users as social actors, highlighting the importance of social contexts in information systems research.

The purpose of this paper is to broaden understanding about the strategic role of IT by examining the nomological network of influences through which IT impacts firm performance.  By drawing upon recent thinking in the strategy, entrepreneurship, and IT management literatures, this paper uses a multitheoretic lens to argue that information technology investments and capabilities influence firm performance through three significant organizational capabilities (agility, digital options, and entrepreneurial alertness) and strategic processes (capability-building, entrepreneurial action, and coevolutionary adaptation).  We also propose that these dynamic capabilities and strategic processes impact the ability of firms to launch many and varied competitive actions and that, in turn, these competitive actions are a significant antecedent of firm performance.

Half the teams used a group support system (GSS), while the other half used traditional processes that were the habitual norms for this organization.  In the teams using traditional project team processes, the leaders defined the teams\u2019 project goal, directed discussions, recorded and controlled the teams\u2019 notes, assigned tasks to team members, and prepared and presented the teams\u2019 report.  In the GSS teams, the leaders faced leadership challenges or abdicated, regular members participated to a greater extent, the project goal emerged from team discussion, and the teams\u2019 notes were open and widely distributed.  In short, processes in the GSS teams were more participatory and democratic.  At first, teams found the GSS-based meeting processes very uncomfortable and returned to traditional verbal discussion-based processes.  Once they returned to these traditional processes, however, they found them uncomfortable and moved back to include more electronic communication-based processes.  Participants\u2019 attitudes (satisfaction, perceived effectiveness, and cohesiveness) were initially lower in GSS teams, but gradually increased, until they equaled those of the traditional teams.  There were significant differences in overall project outcomes:  traditional teams developed conservative projects that met the unstated project agenda perceived by the team leaders.

In this paper, we conduct a close examination of vendor strategy and practices in one long-term successful applications management outsourcing engagement.  Our analysis indicates that the vendor\u2019s efficiency was based on the economic benefits derived from the ability to develop a complementary set of core competencies.  This ability, in turn, was based on the centralization of decision rights from a variety and multitude of IT projects controlled by the vendor.  The vendor was enticed to share the value with the client through formal and informal relationship management structures.  We use the economic concept of complementarity in organizational design, along with prior findings from studies of client-vendor relationships, to explain the IT vendors\u2019 value proposition.

We conducted an experiment involving 51 temporary virtual teams. Half of the teams were required to comply with behavior control mechanisms traditionally used in colocated teams.  Their counterparts were allowed to self-direct.\n\nOur analysis shows that the behavior control mechanisms typically used in traditional teams have a significant negative effect on trust in virtual teams.  In-depth analysis of the communication logs of selected teams reveals that trust decline in virtual teams is rooted in instances of reneging and incongruence.  Behavior control mechanisms increase vigilance and make instances when individuals perceive team members to have failed to uphold their obligations (i.e., reneging and incongruence) salient. Heightened vigilance and salience increase the likelihood that team members\u2019 failure to fulfill their obligations will be detected, thus contributing to trust decline.","https://misq.umn.edu/trust-and-the-unintended-effects-of-behavior-control-in-virtual-teams.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'behavior control', 'virtual teams']","The article discusses the impact of behavior control on trust within virtual teams, which touches on themes of team dynamics and management practices.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model.  The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory.  Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology.  Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships.  UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent).  UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent).  UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems.  The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.","https://misq.umn.edu/user-acceptance-of-information-technology-toward-a-unified-view.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['acceptance', 'interventions', 'populations', 'users']","The article discusses user acceptance of technology and mentions interventions targeted at populations that may be less inclined to adopt new systems, indicating a moderate focus on inclusivity.

Notwithstanding the relevance and potential value of case studies, this methodological approach was once considered to be one of the least systematic. Toward the end of the 1980s, the issue of whether IS case research was rigorously conducted was first raised.  Researchers from our field (e.g., Benbasat et al. 1987; Lee 1989) and from other disciplines (e.g., Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1994) called for more rigor in case research and, through their recommendations, contributed to the advancement of the case study methodology. Considering these contributions, the present study seeks to determine the extent to which the field of IS has advanced in its operational use of case study method. Precisely, it investigates the level of methodological rigor in positivist IS case research conducted over the past decade. To fulfill this objective, we identified and coded 183 case articles from seven major IS journals. Evaluation attributes or criteria considered in the present review focus on three main areas, namely, design issues, data collection, and data analysis. While the level of methodological rigor has experienced modest progress with respect to some specific attributes, the overall assessed rigor is somewhat equivocal and there are still significant areas for improvement.

First, can a model of disruptive IT innovations be created to understand qualitative changes in IT development processes and their outcomes so that they can be related to architectural discontinuities in computing capability?  Second, to what extent can the observed turmoil among systems development organizations that has been spawned by Internet computing be understood as a disruptive IT innovation?\n\nTo address the first question, a model of disruptive IT innovation is developed.  The model defines a disruptive IT innovation as an architectural innovation originating in the information technology base that has subsequent pervasive and radical impacts on development processes and their outcomes. These base innovations establish necessary but not sufficient conditions for subsequent innovation behaviors.

This is shown using a general analytical model of selling in which sales are a joint function of the salesperson's skill and the complexity of the selling task. Complexity varies across products and industries. Intuitively, when the selling task is complex, few salespeople ofanylevel of ability will be successful with a low-quality product. Therefore, the high-skill rep's value is higher on the better product. Conversely, when the task is simple, salespeople ofanyability can sell the better product fairly easily so the high-skill rep's impact is more pronounced on the worse product.

In addition to INE-attribute interactions, increased availability of CD titles is found to have a significant positive impact on the overall price of CD players, which is consistent with past research.

These allowances are lump-sum, up-front transfer payments from manufacturer to retailer when the manufacturer launches a new product. The practice has attracted some scrutiny because of uncertainty about its purposes and consequences. We draw from the extant literature to identify factors that potentially influence the relative magnitude of slotting allowances. Based on analysis of primary survey data from retailers and manufacturers, we observe that charging and paying of slotting allowances are affected by the relative strength of the players. Among retailers, the relative magnitude of slotting fees increases with retailers' informational advantage over the manufacturer about the likely success of the new product, even when retailers recognize that the product is likely to be successful. Additionally, and consistent with the first finding, retailers with lower costs (i.e., potentially more efficient and powerful retailers) received higher slotting allowances.

Firms invest in new product effort in an attempt to attain industry leadership, thus securing high profits and benefiting from advantages relevant for the success of future product generations. The analysis reveals that when the current leader possesses higher research and development (R&D) competence, it tends to investmorein R&D than rivals and to retain its lead position. The leader's investment exhibits an inverse-U pattern as this advantage increases. In contrast, when the leader enjoys an advantage that originates from the persistence of reputation, it investslessthan its followers. Now, followers' investment exhibits an inverse-U pattern as reputation advantage increases. Depending on the extent of leader reputation, industry structure can either exhibit frequent leadership shifts or prolonged incumbent dominance. The basic framework is extended to allow investments in additional marketing variables (e.g., advertising). Interestingly, the leader takes advantage of strong demand for its current product by focusing more on advertising, whereas the follower expends more on R&D. By shedding light on the implications of industry position for investment incentives and market evolution, the analysis provides valuable insights for formulating marketing strategy in fast-paced, high-tech business environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.22.3.355.17742","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition, R&D, and marketing strategies without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In an extended analysis, we show that first-to-market leads to aninitial profit advantage, which, depending on the sample or profit measure, lasts for about 12 to 14 years before turning into a disadvantage. Moreover, we show that pioneers differentially benefit from a lack of consumer learning, a strong market position and patent protection. These three moderating factors together can actually help pioneers achieve a sustainable profit advantage over later entrants.

Our application, involving liquid laundry detergent, establishes the feasibility and desirability of doing such augmentations of scanner panel data: The joint scanner panel/choice experiment model has significantly better prediction performance on a holdout data set than does a pure scanner panel model.

The present paper proposes that the conjunction of two simple assumptions (relating effort-induced reward expectations to prospect theory's value function) provides a parsimonious theory that predicts that the nature of the required effort will have a systematic effect on such trade-offs. Using the case of frequency (or loyalty) programs, a series of five studies involving both real and hypothetical choices demonstrated that (a) the presence (as opposed to absence) of effort requirements enhances the preference for sure-small rewards over large-uncertain rewards; (b) the preference for reward certainty is attenuated when the effort activity is intrinsically motivating; and (c) continuously increasing the effort level leads to an inverted-U effect on the preference for sure-small over largeuncertain rewards. The studies also employ process measures and examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of the effort stream on the trade-off between the certainty and magnitude of rewards. The final section discusses the theoretical implications of this research as well as the practical implications with respect to frequency programs and other types of incentive systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.22.4.477.24911","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making related to effort and rewards without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off at higher levels of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and banner exposure sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit over a longer period of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions.

The model conceptualizes the impact of customer acceptance of a direct channel, the degree to which customers accept a direct channel as a substitute for shopping at a traditional store, on supply-chain design. The customer acceptance of a direct channel can be strong enough that an indepent manufacturer would open a direct channel to compete with its own retailers. Here, direct marketing is used for strategic channel control purposes even though it is inefficient on its own and, surprisingly, it can profit the manufacturer even when so direct sales occur. Specifically, we construct a price-setting game between a manufacturer and its independent retailer. Direct marketing, which indirectly increases the flow of profits through the retail channel, helps the manufacturer improve overall profitability by reducing the degree of inefficient price double marginalization. While operated by the manufacturer to constrain the retailer's pricing behavior, the direct channel may not always be detrimental to the retailer because it will be accompanied by a wholesale price reduction. This combination of manufacturer pull and push can benefit the retailer in equilibrium. Finally, we show that the mere threat of introducing the direct channel can increase the manufacturer's negotiated share of cooperative profits even if price efficiency is obtained by using other business practices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.1.1.12749","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply-chain design and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This suggests, somewhat counterintuitively, that there may exist some optimal level of conflict for efficient measurement of preferences. How to determine this level?

We test whether receivers' rates of monetary sacrifice depend on the process by which an outcome is reached. We study two decision-elicitation methods: the strategy and the direct response methods. For each method, deception more than doubles the punishment rate as a response to an action that is unfavorable to the receiver.

The demonstrations are made partly by using a real Finnish forest and price data, and partly by using artificial data. In the real data example, the system is demonstrated using a case where it is assumed that the land owner has several mature forest stands, which can be harvested at any time during the next 3 years. Investment alternatives are stocks, government bonds, and bank deposits. The forestry returns were defined as a sum of exponential physical growth and stumpage price return. The chosen definition of forestry returns makes the model very useful, for example, when speculating on what speed of physical growth is needed to make forestry a competitive investment alternative when both returns and risks are considered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.1.131.12752","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization model for timber harvesting and investment strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Performance of members in such groups has yet to be studied longitudinally. A model proposes not only direct effects of functional role, status, and communication role on individual performance, but also indirect effects through individual centrality. Social network analysis was performed on e-mail samples from two time periods separated by four years. Analysis revealed both direct and indirect effects as hypothesized; however, the indirect effects were more consistent in both time periods. The clearest findings were that centrality mediates the effects of functional role, status, and communication role on individual performance. Interestingly, centrality was a stronger direct predictor of performance than the individual characteristics considered in this study. The study illustrates the usefulness of accounting for network effects for better understanding individual performance in virtual groups.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.1.21.12756","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['communication technologies', 'geographically-distributed', 'individual performance']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of performance in virtual R&D groups without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

However, through contrasting the various learning process theories described in the research on organizational, group, and individual learning, we develop a set of competing hypotheses that suggest some degree of variation might improve the learning rate. Furthermore, such comparison yields competing arguments about how related or unrelated such task variation should be to improve the learning rate. This research uses an experimental study to answer the following research questions: Is the learning rate maximized through specialization? Or does variation, related or unrelated, enhance the learning process? We find that the learning rate under conditions of related variation is significantly greater than under conditions of specialization or unrelated variation, indicating the possibility of synergy between related learning efforts consistent with an implicit learning or insight effect. We find no significant differences in the rates of learning under the conditions of specialization and unrelated variation. These results yield important implications for how work should be organized, and for future research into the learning process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.1.39.12750","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['learning', 'variation', 'organizational']","The article discusses organizational learning and the potential benefits of variation, but it does not explicitly address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Arguments for such policies vary, but they typically assume that benefits of subsidization must be large enough to outweigh a presumed economic cost of the subsidy. When disadvantaged competitors compete in auctions, the subsidy serves to make them more competitive rivals. Other bidders rationally respond by bidding more aggressively.

Much of traditional auction theory has focused on analyzing single-item auctions in isolation from the market context in which they take place. We demonstrate the weakness of such approaches in online settings where a majority of auctions are multiunit in nature. Rather than pursuing a classical approach and assuming knowledge of the distribution of consumers' valuations, we emphasize the largely ignored discrete and sequential nature of such auctions. We derive a general expression that characterizes the multiple equilibria that can arise in such auctions and segregate these into desirable and undesirable categories. Our analytical and empirical results, obtained by tracking real-world online auctions, indicate that bid increment is an important factor amongst the control factors that online auctioneers can manipulate and control. We show that consumer bidding strategies in such auctions are not uniform and that the level of bid increment chosen influences them. With a motive of providing concrete strategic directions to online auctioneers, we derive an absolute upper bound for the bid increment. Based on the theoretical upper bound we propose a heuristic decision rule for setting the bid increment. Empirical evidence lends support to the hypothesis that setting a bid increment higher than that suggested by the heuristic decision rule has a negative impact on the auctioneer's revenue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.1.85.12754","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online auctions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Computational complexity can be dealt with algorithmically by relegating the computational burden to bidders, by maintaining fairness in the face of computational limitations, by limiting biddable combinations, and by limiting the use of combinatorial bids. Combinatorial auction designs include single-round, first-price sealed bidding, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms, uniform and market-clearing price auctions, and iterative combinatorial auctions.

We investigate bidding behavior within the most active area of these early knowledge markets\u2014the market for software development. These markets are important both because they provide an early view of the effectiveness of online service markets and because they have a potentially large impact on how software development services are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and transaction behavior, taking into account costly bidding. We then test our model using data from an active online market for software development services, which yields contracts for 30%\u201340% of posted projects. In its current format, however, the studied market may induce excessive bidding by vendors. Consistent with our theoretical predictions and those of Carr (2003), higher-value projects attract significantly more bids, with lower average quality. Greater numbers of bids raise the cost to all participants, due to costly bidding and bid evaluation. Perhaps as a consequence, higher-value projects are also much less likely to be awarded.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1504.20587","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding behavior in online markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Each bid consists of a price and a set of nonprice attributes (e.g., quality, lead time). The manufacturer is assumed to know the parametric form of the suppliers' cost functions (in terms of the nonprice attributes), but has no prior information on the parameter values. We construct a multiround open-ascending auction mechanism, where the manufacturer announces a slightly different scoring rule (i.e., a function that ranks the bids in terms of the price and nonprice attributes) in each round. Via inverse optimization, the manufacturer uses the bids from the first several rounds to learn the suppliers' cost functions, and then in the final round chooses a scoring rule that attempts to maximize his own utility. Under the assumption that suppliers submit their myopic best-response bids in the last round, and do not distort their bids in the earlier rounds (i.e., they choose their minimum-cost bid to achieve any given score), our mechanism, indeed, maximizes the manufacturer's utility within the open-ascending format. We also discuss several enhancements that improve the robustness of our mechanism with respect to the model's informational and behavioral assumptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1529.20588","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical mechanism for procurement auctions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A distinctive feature of this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round, such a strategy would require them to go through many additional online transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction, such as submitting an offer. Thus, in our setting, consumers trade off a direct financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer choice model capturing this trade-off, we use the observed consumer behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers in our sample. We show that, perhaps contrary to the general wisdom, frictional costs in electronic markets are substantial, with median values ranging from EUR 3.54 for a portable digital music player (MP3) to EUR 6.08 for a personal digital assistant (PDA). We find that consumers who have gathered experience with the NYOP channel in previous transactions exhibit lower frictional costs than consumers who use the channel for the first time.

While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains. One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability of online retailers to catalog, recommend, and provide a large number of products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at Amazon.com is more than 23 times larger than the number of books on the shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore, and 57 times greater than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent bookstore. Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in the year 2000, which is between 7 and 10 times as large as the consumer welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market. There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software and hardware.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1580.20580","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on economic impacts and consumer surplus without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Such options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in integrating long- and short-term contracting between multiple buyers and sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits. Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B transactions. This paper notes broad set of goods and services currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost economics, and we use this framework to provide review and synthesis of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries.

We assess the a la carte versus the money-back-guarantee programs, and find the surprising result that the money-back-guarantee program appears (for the patients) to be \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d That is, the money-back guarantee yields a substantial negative expected profit per couple for the clinics. More importantly from the patients' perspective, the money-back guarantee is the better option for all couples with less than 0.5 success probability per cycle. Virtually all traditional IVF patients have had per-cycle success probabilities below 0.5. A detailed analysis of the key variables\u2014i.e., success rate per attempt, heterogeneity of couples' rates of success, individual couples' \u201clearning\u201d on successive attempts, and cost to the clinic per attempt\u2014shows that these money-back guarantees are unprofitable for the clinics. Since presumably clinics are not in business to lose money, the standard analysis must be missing something major. We suggest that the marketing of money-back guarantees is inducing couples who would previously have used\u2014successfully\u2014other less invasive procedures with fewer side effects and less risk of multiple births to decide to proceed directly to IVF, and that this scenario makes the money-back guarantees profitable for the clinics.

As is common in these industries, prior to receiving a firm purchase order from the customer, the supplier receives a series of shared forecasts, which are called \u201csoft orders.\u201d Facing a stochastic internal manufacturing lead time, the supplier must decide at what time to begin the fulfillment of the order. This decision requires a trade-off between starting too early, leading to potential holding or cancellation costs, and starting too late, leading to potential delay costs. We collect detailed data of shared forecasts, actual purchase orders, production lead times, and delivery dates for a supplier-buyer dyad in the semiconductor equipment supply chain. Under the assumption that the supplier acts rationally, optimally balancing the cancellation, holding, and delay costs, we are able to estimate the corresponding imputed cost parameters based on the observed data. Our estimation results reveal that the supplier perceives the cost of cancellation to be about two times higher and the holding costs to be about three times higher than the delay cost. In other words, the supplier is very conservative when commencing the order fulfillment, which undermines the effectiveness of the overall forecast-sharing mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.12.1653.25115","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost estimation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Economists contend that despite the firm's best efforts to erect governance structures that reduce opportunism and preserve outcomes, there is always some opportunism that remains once the transaction is in place. Despite this, there are few studies that systematically investigate the safeguarding efficacy of relationship attributes in the presence of such ex post opportunism. In this research, we develop a theoretical framework and provide a longitudinal test of the ability of various relationship safeguards to preserve performance outcomes and future expectations given varying levels of ex post opportunism in the relationship. Our survey results from over 300 buyers and suppliers indicates that given lower levels of opportunism, bilateral idiosyncratic investments and interpersonal trust enhance performance outcomes and future expectations, while goal congruence has no discernable effect. However, at higher levels of opportunism, goal congruence becomes a more powerful safeguard, while interpersonal trust becomes less effective. Bilateral idiosyncratic investments continue to preserve performance outcomes and future expectations even at higher levels of opportunism.

First, it appears that the original paper imposes a condition that has the effect of eliminating a broad range of legitimate separating equilibria from the analyses. Second, it appears that the original model does not include constraints to ensure that the demand for each market segment will be nonnegative. When these constraints on demand are included, one obtains different aggregate demand curves, which leads to different equilibrium prices. Using the revised model and analysis, we find that 71% of the prices end in 9 and only 12% in 0. This contrasts with only 3% ending in 9 and 58% ending in 0 for the original study.

In each sequence of periods, a number of different incentive mechanisms based on the agent's communication and/or outcome are considered. Results of the computational experiments are presented. Our results overwhelmingly show the efficacy of the incentive contracts in improving the welfare of the investors. In the presence of an estimation risk, when agents learn from their past performances, the market volatility interacts with the estimation risk that makes risk\u2013sharing arrangements such as limited liability overly important. Paying the agent to assume the risk may no longer lead to the best performance incentives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.2.160.12742","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['moral hazard', 'risk aversion', 'welfare']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of incentive mechanisms and investment strategies without any significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The purpose of this study is to obtain sales forecasts for a new album before it is introduced. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model based on a logistic diffusion process. It allows for the generalization of various adoption patterns out of discrete data and can be applied in a situation where the eventual number of adopters is unknown. Using sales of previous albums along with information known prior to the launch of a new album, the model constructs informed priors, yielding prelaunch sales forecasts, which are out-of-sample predictions. In the context of new product forecasting before introduction, the information we have is limited to the relevant background characteristics of a new album. Knowing only the general attributes of a new album, the meta-analytic approach proposed here provides an informed prior on the dynamics of duration, the effects of marketing variables, and the unknown market potential. As new data become available, weekly sales forecasts and market size (number of eventual adopters) are revised and updated. We illustrate our approach using weekly sales data of albums that appeared inBillboard'sTop 200 albums chart from January 1994 to December 1995.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.2.179.12744","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for sales forecasting in the music industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with our theoretical development, we find that new product introductions influence profit rate and size; however, we find no effect on profit-rate persistence. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of new product introductions on profit rate stems from a reduction in selling and general administrative expenditure intensity rather than through an increase in gross operating return. Notably, firms decrease their advertising intensity in the wake of a new product introduction. Firm profitability in this industry apparently benefits from new product introductions because new products need less marketing support than older products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.2.197.12741","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on financial metrics related to product introductions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

First, we show that this error probability converges to zero exponentially fast with sample size for negatively dependent sampling. Then we consider stratified quantile estimators and show that the error probability for these estimators can be guaranteed to be 0 with sufficiently large, but finite, sample size.

A portfolio of customers with different demand lead times gives rise to what we call advance demand information. We develop effective inventory policies for a distribution system to account for this information. In particular, we study a centralized system with one warehouse serving multiple retailers under advance demand information. The inventory manager replenishes the warehouse from an outside supplier. Units arriving to the warehouse are allocated to the retailers. To control this system, we develop a lower bound and proposed a close-to-optimal heuristic for which the optimality gap is on average 1.92%. We also provide a closed-form solution to approximate the system-wide inventory level. Using this explicit solution, the model and the heuristic, we investigate (1) the benefit of advance demand information, and its impact on allocation decisions, (2) the joint role of risk pooling and advance demand information, and (3) the system performance with respect to supplier and retailer lead times. We illustrate how advance demand information can be a substitute for lead times and inventory, and how it enhances the outcome of delayed differentiation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.3.255.12738","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and distribution systems without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2003","49","3","Sarv DevarajSarv Devarajsdevaraj@nd.eduDepartment of Management, Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556Search for more papers by this author, Rajiv KohliRajiv Kohlirkohli@nd.eduDepartment of Management, Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556Search for more papers by this author","Performance Impacts of Information Technology: Is Actual Usage the Missing Link?","The relationship between investment in information technology (IT) and its effect on organizational performance continues to interest academics and practitioners. In many cases, due to the nature of the research design employed, this stream of research has been unable to identify the impact of individual technologies on organizational performance. This study posits that the driver of IT impact is not the investment in the technology, but the actual usage of the technology. This proposition is tested in a longitudinal setting of a healthcare system comprising eight hospitals. Monthly data for a three\u2013year period on various financial and nonfinancial measures of hospital performance and technology usage were analyzed. The data analysis provides evidence for the technology usage\u2013performance link after controlling for various external factors.

The analysis was triangulated using three measures of technology usage.

An agent-based simulation allows us to model three design elements and two contextual variables that have rarely been analyzed jointly: a vertical hierarchy that reviews proposals from subordinates, an incentive system that rewards subordinates for departmental or firm-wide performance, the decomposition of an organization's many decisions into departments, the underlying pattern of interactions among decisions, and limits on the ability of managers to process information. Interdependencies arise among these features because of a basic, general tension. To be successful, an organization must broadly search for good sets of decisions, but it must also stabilize around good decisions once discovered. An effective organization balances search and stability. We identify sets of design elements that encourage broad search and others that promote stability. The adoption of elements that encourage broad search typically raises the marginal benefit of other elements that provide offsetting stability. Hence, the need to balance search and stability generates interdependencies among the design elements. We pay special attention to interdependencies that involve the vertical hierarchy. Our findings confirm many aspects of conventional wisdom about vertical hierarchies, but challenge or put boundary conditions on others. We place limits, for instance, on the received wisdom that firm-wide incentives and capable subordinates make top-level oversight less valuable. We also identify circumstances in which vertical hierarchies can lead to inferior long-term performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.3.290.12740","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","[]","The article focuses primarily on organizational design and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Many classification methods have been suggested in the literature to tackle this problem. Neural networks, especially, have received a lot of attention because of their universal approximation property. However, a major drawback associated with the use of neural networks for decision making is their lack of explanation capability. While they can achieve a high predictive accuracy rate, the reasoning behind how they reach their decisions is not readily available. In this paper, we present the results from analysing three real-life credit-risk data sets using neural network rule extraction techniques. Clarifying the neural network decisions by explanatory rules that capture the learned knowledge embedded in the networks can help the credit-risk manager in explaining why a particular applicant is classified as either bad or good. Furthermore, we also discuss how these rules can be visualized as a decision table in a compact and intuitive graphical format that facilitates easy consultation. It is concluded that neural network rule extraction and decision tables are powerful management tools that allow us to build advanced and userfriendly decision-support systems for credit-risk evaluation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.3.312.12739","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit-risk evaluation using neural networks without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

In resource-constrained project scheduling, the jobs additionally compete for scarce resources. Due to its universality, the latter problem has a variety of applications in manufacturing, production planning, project management, and elsewhere. It is one of the most intractable problems in operations research, and has therefore become a popular playground for the latest optimization techniques, including virtually all local search paradigms. We show that a somewhat more classical mathematical programming approach leads to both competitive feasible solutions and strong lower bounds, within reasonable computation times. The basic ingredients of our approach are the Lagrangian relaxation of a time-indexed integer programming formulation and relaxation-based list scheduling, enriched with a useful idea from recent approximation algorithms for machine scheduling problems. The efficiency of the algorithm results from the insight that the relaxed problem can be solved by computing a minimum cut in an appropriately defined directed graph. Our computational study covers different types of resource-constrained project scheduling problems, based on several notoriously hard test sets, including practical problem instances from chemical production planning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.3.330.12737","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project scheduling and optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In models that link scientific capabilities to patent citations, we show that scientific ideas are not simply inputs into inventions; important scientific ideas and influential patents follow different and conflicting selection logics. Publication, collaboration, and science intensity are associated with patented innovations; however, important scientific papers are negatively associated with high-impact innovations. These results point to conflicting logics between science and innovation, and scientists must contribute to both while inhabiting a single epistemic community. We identify individuals listed on patents and scientific papers and find they effectively integrate science with innovation, leading to more successful innovations. Our findings suggest that the role of the small, research-intensive firm is to create a repository of knowledge; to act as an organizational mechanism to combine the capabilities of versatile scientists within and outside the boundaries of the firm; and to manage the selection of scientific ideas to produce valuable technical innovations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.4.366.14420","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['scientific knowledge', 'innovation', 'collaboration']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between scientific knowledge and innovation within biotechnology firms, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Two complementary case studies and survey data from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through which this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1) the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus external competitors, and (2) the availability or scarcity of knowledge-internal knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it appear more special and unique.

These two groups are often characterized as engaging in a \u201cturf war\u201d for patients. After controlling for several factors that might explain technological choice\u2014the clinical severity of patients, the relative quality of the two procedures at a given facility, firm-level financial performance, and other firm-level characteristics\u2014I find that the technological status of the group associated with each technique affects the relative rate at which it is used within a given hospital. Moreover, this effect is strongest for patients at the margin between the two techniques.

There are deterministic transportation leadtimes between stages, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged.

To identify the key determinants of the optimal policy, we develop a simple and surprisingly good heuristic. This method minimizes 2Nseparate newsvendor-type cost functions, each of which uses the original problem data only. These functions are lower and upper bounds for the echelon cost functions; their minimizers form bounds for the optimal echelon base-stock levels. The heuristic is the simple average of the solution bounds. In extensive numerical experiments, the average relative error of the heuristic is 0.24%, with the maximum error less than 1.5%. The bounds and the heuristic, which can be easily obtained by simple spreadsheet calculations, enhance the accessibility and implementability of the multiechelon inventory theory. More importantly, the closed-form expressions provide an analytical tool for us to gain insights into issues such as system bottlenecks, effects of system parameters, and coordination mechanisms in decentralized systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.5.618.15147","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory policy optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consumers are unable to judge the value difference between a baseline product and a product upgrade with add-on features. While the firm and the salespeople are informed of the value of these features, consumers are uncertain. Thus, consumers have to rely on sales assistance to evaluate alternatives. The salesperson decision variables include selling effort and whether to \u201coversell\u201d the consumer by overclaiming the value of added features. Because sales revenue depends on both the salesperson's selling effort and consumers' valuation of the added features, the salesforce incentive scheme (which can consist of salary, sales commission, or consumer satisfaction-based commission) may induce the short-term oriented salesperson to misrepresent the value of the upgrade. Exaggeration of the value of the added features, however, results in reduced satisfaction levels leading to lower profits for the firm. We show that a salesperson selling products where the value of the upgrade is low prefers to make higher claims when the sales commission rate is sufficiently high. We conjecture that consumers aware of the incentive structure facing the salesperson expect the true value of the add-on feature to be lower than the claimed value. We study the optimal compensation scheme of a firm, which has to communicate her true type and retain its salesforce credibility. We identify the conditions under which a high-upgrade-type firm indicates its true value by altering sales commission rate and satisfaction-based commission rate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.5.655.15146","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['consumer satisfaction', 'sales commission', 'value difference']","The article primarily focuses on sales strategies and compensation schemes without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

The scheme operates as a (Q, r) policy with the following feature. Demands from both classes are filled on a first-come-first-serve basis as long as on-hand inventory lies above a threshold levelK. Once on-hand inventory falls below this level, low-priority (i.e., low shortage cost) demand is backordered while high-priority demand continues to be filled. We analyze this static policy first under the assumption that backorders are filled according to a special threshold clearing mechanism. Structural results for the key performance measures are established to enable an efficient solution algorithm for computing stock control and rationing parameters (i.e.,Q, r, andK). Numerical results confirm that the solution under this special threshold clearing mechanism closely approximates that of the priority clearing policy. We next highlight conditions where our policy offers significant savings over traditional \u201cround-up\u201d and \u201cseparate stock\u201d policies encountered in the military and elsewhere. Finally, we develop a lower bound on the cost of the optimal rationing policy.

We develop tight lower bounds and a variety of heuristics accompanied with extensive computational tests regarding their performance.

Using these heuristics, we perform experiments on the effect of operating flexibility on project duration, where resource flexibility is measured by the number of resources available per activity, and the form of the availability matrixA. Our experiments lead to important managerial guidelines regarding the role of resource flexibility on project duration.

It is well known that this coordination becomes progressively more difficult with project size, but we do not yet sufficiently understand whether this effect can be controlled with frequent and rich communication among project members, or whether it is inevitable. Recent work in complexity theory suggests that a project might form a \u201crugged landscape,\u201d for which performance deterioration with system size is inevitable. This paper builds a mathematical model of a complex design project that is divided into components (subproblems) and integrated back to the system. The model explicitly represents local component decisions, as well as component interactions in determining system performance. The model shows, first, how a rugged performance landscape arises even from simple components with simple performance functions, if the components are interdependent. Second, we characterize the dynamic behavior of the system analytically and with simulations. We show under which circumstances it exhibits performance oscillations or divergence to design solutions with low performance. Third, we derive classes of managerial actions available to improve performance dynamics, such as modularization, immediate communication, and exchanging preliminary information.

Through the analysis of patent citation patterns in the semiconductor industry, we first demonstrate both the geographic and technological localization of knowledge. We then explore if the formation of alliances and mobility of active inventors facilitate interfirm knowledge flows across contexts. We find that mobility is associated with interfirm knowledge flows regardless of geographic proximity and, in fact, the usefulness of alliances and mobility increases with technological distance.

Although increasing evidence indicates that quality improvement reduces software development costs, the impact on infrastructure activities is not known. Infrastructure activities include services like computer operations, data integration, and configuration management that support software development. Because infrastructure costs represent a substantial portion of firms' information technology budgets, it is important to identify innovations that yield significant cost savings in infrastructure activities. We evaluate quality and cost data collected in nine infrastructure activity centers over 10 years of product development in a major software firm undergoing a quality transformation. Findings indicate that infrastructure activities do benefit from quality improvement. The greatest marginal cost savings are realized in infrastructure activities that are highly interdependent with development and that occur later in the software development life cycle. Organizational inertia influences the rapidity with which the infrastructure activities benefit from higher product quality, especially for the more specialized activities. Finally, our findings suggest that although the savings in infrastructure from quality improvement are substantial, there are diminishing returns to quality improvement in infrastructure activities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.6.784.16023","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development and cost analysis without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This implies that a fully deterministic queueing system can exhibit seemingly unpredictable behaviour. We ignore variability, and focus on two forms of feedback: (i) the service rate increases as queue length increases, and (ii) the arrival rate depends on customers' perception of past waiting times. We model a customer's decision to seek service as a two stage process: (i) deciding whether or not to use a facility, and (ii) deciding the frequency of visit (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This frequency is initially constant, and later on replaced by a deterministic, time-dependent pattern. Although highly stylised, this model captures the essential features of many real-life systems whose average arrival rate varies over time. Reducing the amplitude of cycles in demand makes the system more predictable and thus easier to manage. Although we represent this model as a queue of customers waiting for service, the model can be interpreted more generally as any situation where an increase in demand lowers the quality of service.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.6.816.16028","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of a deterministic queueing system without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We also consider the value of such output\u2013based contracts when gatekeepers are heterogeneous in ability, so that two gatekeeper types face different probabilities of treatment success when given the same problem.

These measures are compared and validated using a simulated data set that embodies the range of variation likely to be encountered in empirical studies.

Unfortunately, key parameters that influence water treatment policy are unknown, in part because of lack of data and effective inference methods. This paper develops inference methods for those parameters by using stochastic process models to better incorporate infection dynamics into the inference process.

An agent is said to be subjectively rational when decisions are consistent with the available facts and, where these are lacking, with the agent's own subjective assessments. A self\u2013confirming equilibrium arises when agents' subjectively rational actions generate events that are consistent with their own expectations. Equilibrium strategies may be suboptimal because certain counterfactual beliefs may be erroneous and yet fail to be contradicted by events observed in equilibrium. This weakening of the stronger rationality assumptions inherent in many of the more familiar equilibrium ideas appears well suited to applications in strategy.

Users, in turn, are sensitive to the delay implied by the potential degradation in service rate, and to the usage fee charged for accessing the system. We study the equilibrium behavior of such systems in the specific context of pricing and capacity sizing under revenue and social optimization objectives. Exact solutions to these problems can only be obtained via exhaustive simulations. In contrast, we pursue approximate solutions that exploit large-capacity asymptotics. Economic considerations and natural scaling relations demonstrate that the optimal operational mode for the system is close to \u201cheavy traffic.\u201d This, in turn, supports the derivation of simple approximate solutions to economic optimization problems, via asymptotic methods that completely alleviate the need for simulation. These approximations seem to be extremely accurate. The main insights that are gleaned in the analysis follow: congestion costs are \u201csmall,\u201d the optimal price admits a two-part decomposition, and the joint capacity sizing and pricing problem decouples and admits simple analytical solutions that are asymptotically optimal.

In addition, customization is more feasible today because of advances in manufacturing technologies that have improved sellers' manufacturing flexibility. We first develop a model of product customization and flexible pricing to incorporate the salient roles of the Internet and flexible manufacturing technologies in reducing the costs of designing and producing tailored consumer goods. We show how a monopoly seller may earn the highest profits by producing both standard and custom products and can raise prices for both types of products as customization and information collection technologies improve. Simultaneous adoption of customization in a duopoly reduces the differentiation between their standard products but does not intensify price competition. Compared with a two-facility monopolist, the duopoly may underinvest in customization. Consumer surplus improves after sellers adopt customization but does not monotonically increase as customization technologies advance. When firms face a fixed entry cost and adopt customization sequentially, the first entrant always achieves an advantage and may be able to deter subsequent entry by choosing its customization scope strategically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.8.1055.16401","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product customization and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of an attribute, on an attribute evaluation function, or on willingness to pay.

Under demand postponement, a fraction of the demands from the \u201cregular\u201d period are postponed and satisfied during a \u201cpostponement\u201d period. This permits capacity to be procured to satisfy the postponed demands. A reimbursement per unit is paid to customers whose demands are postponed. The basic idea is that by preempting stockouts through demand postponement, we can reduce overall stockout costs. We formulate and solve a two-stage capacity planning problem under demand postponement. We propose a power range class of distributions to capture the nature of demand surges. We establish the scalability and conjugate properties of the power range distributions under demand postponement, which leads to a tractable analysis of the problem. We analytically solve the problem of determining the optimal regular and postponement period capacities, and the demand splitting rule to minimize the supplier's expected cost. We show that (a) the value of postponement may be significant depending on cost and demand parameters, (b) a postponement strategy may lead to reduced investment in initial capacity, and (c) it may be optimal to do no demand postponement over a range of demands even after observing a higher demand signal. We then relax several model assumptions and provide results for these extensions.

We show that it is possible, using these data, to recover essential features of the underlying distribution of consumer willingness to pay. Knowledge of this distribution may enable the retailer to generate additional profits from targeting by using choice information at the checkout counter. In estimating demand we incorporate a supply-side model of the distribution channel that captures important features of competitive price-setting behavior of firms. This latter aspect helps us control for the potential endogeneity generated by unmeasured product characteristics in aggregate data. The channel controls for competitive aspects both between manufacturers and between manufacturers and a retailer. Despite this competition, we find that targeted pricing need not generate the prisoner's dilemma in our data. This contrasts with the findings of theoretical models due to the flexibility of the empirical model of demand. The demand system we estimate captures richer forms of product differentiation, both vertical and horizontal, as well as a more flexible distribution of consumer heterogeneity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.9.1121.16565","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Pricing and delivery-frequency decisions in the system are analyzed by two three-stage noncooperative games with different decision rights designated to the parties involved. The customer first sets the price (or delivery frequency) for each supplier. Then, the suppliers offer the delivery frequencies (or prices) simultaneously and independently. Finally, the customer determines how much demand to allocate to each of the suppliers. We show that delivery frequency, similar to delivery speed in time-based competition, can be a source of competitive advantage. It also allows firms that sell identical products to offer complementary services to the customer because she can lower her inventory with deliveries from more suppliers. In general, higher delivery frequencies lower the value of getting deliveries from the second supplier and therefore intensify price competition. Assuming the cost structures do not change and the suppliers are identical, we show that when the customer controls deliveries, she would strategically increase delivery frequencies to lower prices. The distortion in delivery frequencies is larger and the overall performance of the supply chain is lower when the customer, not the suppliers, controls deliveries. Moreover, the customer is better off under delivery competition, while the suppliers are better off under price competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.9.1139.16567","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain competition without addressing any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

If the upstream facility cannot meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is optimal.

However, lateral transshipments between the warehouses are also possible. Such transshipments take no time but incur additional costs. When a demand occurs at a warehouse, the question is whether the whole demand or part of it should be covered by a lateral transshipment from another warehouse. Given a set of alternative decisions, our decision rule minimizes the expected costs under the assumption that no further transshipments will take place. This rule is then used repeatedly as a heuristic.

A cost\u2013based evaluation of such services should depend on the total cost associated with the service\u2014i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further, we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress), consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average progress.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.49.9.1229.16574","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice and service evaluation without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The supplier chooses the service rate, i.e., the capacity of his manufacturing facility, which behaves as a single-server queue with exponential service times. Demand is backlogged and both agents share the backorder cost. In addition, a linear inventory holding cost is charged to the retailer, and a linear cost for building production capacity is incurred by the supplier. The inventory level, demand rate, and cost parameters are common knowledge to both agents. Under the continuous-state approximation where the M/M/1 queue has an exponential rather than geometric steady-state distribution, we characterize the optimal centralized and Nash solutions, and show that a contract with linear transfer payments replicates a cost-sharing agreement and coordinates the system.

The products differ only in their prices and delivery times. We assume that there are dedicated capacities for each product and that there is a standard industry delivery time for the regular (slower) product. The objective of the firm is to determine the delivery time of the express (faster) product and appropriately price the two products, taking into consideration the impact of delivery time reduction on capacity requirements and costs. We develop a model that integrates pricing and delivery time decisions with capacity requirements and costs, and study scenarios where the firm is constrained in capacity for none, one, or both product(s). We show how product differentiation decisions are influenced by capacity costs, and how the firm should adapt its differentiation strategy in response to a change in its operating dynamics. We first identify a market characteristic that governs the optimal pricing structure. We then show that the degree of product differentiation depends on both the absolute, as well as the relative values of the capacity costs. Provided that the capacity cost differential remains the same, higher capacity costs induce less time differentiation and less price differentiation. An increase in capacity cost differential increases price differentiation, but decreases time differentiation. The optimal prices depend, in addition to the above, on the market characteristic. We find that prices can actually decrease when the firm incurs capacity-related costs. We also explore the impact of substitutability on product differentiation, and illustrate our results in a numerical study.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.5.1.18.12757","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product differentiation and pricing strategies without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

We show that long-run average cost function for the single-product (R, T ) policy has a structure similar to that of the (Q, r) model. Consequently, many of the useful properties of the latter model are applicable. In particular, the optimal cost is insensitive to the choice of the replenishment interval, T, provided the optimal order-up-to level, R, corresponding to T is used. For instance, a suboptimal T obtained from a deterministic analysis increases costs by no more than 6.125%. For continuous demand, we analytically prove that use of a (R, T)policy instead of the optimal policy increases costs by at most 41.42% in the worst case. Computational experiments on Poisson demand demonstrate that the average-case relative error of using a (R,T)policy is under 7.5%. This relative error is lower when the demand rate and leadtime are high and the fixed order costs are either very low or very high. When coordination of order placement epochs is desirable, the (R,T) policy may sometimes be preferred to the (Q, r) policy. In this context, we illustrate application of our single-product results to more complex systems. In particular, we show that a simple power-of-two, (R,T) based heuristic for the stochastic multiproduct joint replenishment problem has a worst-case performance guarantee of 1.5.

This paper presents a methodology for determining which versions of a set of related components should be offered to optimally support a defined finished product portfolio. We develop optimization models that determine which versions of each component should be introduced and which of these versions each product should use to minimize design and production costs. This approach is appropriate for components with a relatively low impact on consumers\u2019 perceptions about product differentiation, which can be shared across a set of products if they meet the most stringent performance requirements in the set. We illustrate our procedure on automotive braking systems, but also discuss its applicability to other components and industries. We identify three conceptually different organizational approaches to component sharing: a coordinated projects approach that requires higher-level organizational echelons above the individual project, a project-by-project approach that does not, and a hybrid partially coordinated approach. We use our model to examine how the gain from the coordinated projects approach relative to the project-by-project approach varies with the number of component versions in consideration, warranty costs, complexity costs, and demand variability. Further, we use our model to highlight the risk of using simplistic heuristics to determine design sequence within a component system in a partially coordinated approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.5.2.142.16073","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for optimizing component sharing in manufacturing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical issues.

In academia, the two subjects are studied by separate communities of scholars publishing in disjoint sets of journals, drawing on mostly separate disciplinary foundations. Yet, operations and human resources are intimately related at a fundamental level. Operations are the context that often explains or moderates the effects of human resource activities such as pay, training, communications, and staffing. Human responses to OM systems often explain variations or anomalies that would otherwise be treated as randomness or error variance in traditional operations research models.

Moreover, if the supplier's reservation profit is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer's optimal contract is a quantity-premium price-only schedule, that is, the average wholesale price per unit increases in the order size. We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of Cachon and Lariviere (2001). With this enrichment, we prove that share-the-pain contracts, such as firm commitment and options contracts, increase supplier capacity in the full information case, a result that contrasts with that of Cachon and Lariviere.

For such problems, several optimization criteria have been proposed, including maximization of process yield, maximization of process capability, minimization of process costs, etc. In this research, we propose a method that accounts for many of these criteria via a procedure that interacts with and relies on the preferences of a decision maker (DM). The interactive procedure evolves from the convergence of three areas of research: notably, the research in multiple-response design, the research in multicriteria optimization, and recent developments in global optimization. The proposed interactive method is illustrated and comparatively assessed via two well-known problems in multiple-response design. Although the interactive procedure is developed for application in multiple-response design, it is not limited to this problem context. The concepts and methods developed in this research have applicability to problems that can be characterized by process inputs and process performance, such as supply chain management and multidisciplinary design optimization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.5.4.334.24886","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product and process design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We apply it to the problem of replenishing inventory to subsets of products/locations, such as in the distribution of industrial gases, so as to minimize long-run time average replenishment costs. Given a marginal value for each product/location, whenever there is a stockout the dispatcher compares the total value of each feasible replenishment with its cost, and chooses one that maximizes the surplus. We derive this operating policy using a linear functional approximation to the optimal value function of a semi-Markov decision process on continuous spaces. This approximation also leads to a math program whose optimal dual prices yield values and whose optimal objective value gives a lower bound on system performance. We use duality theory to show that optimal prices satisfy several structural properties and can be interpreted as estimates of lowest achievable marginal costs. On real-world instances, the price-directed policy achieves superior, near optimal performance as compared with other approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.5.4.348.24884","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for inventory routing and cost minimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The system consists of (i) a nonlinear integer model to optimize smelter operations, including the investment decisions relating to smelting capacity and pollution control plants that complies with environmental regulations, and (ii) a network flow model to describe the economic behavior of the sulfuric acid market, which considers the sulfuric acid produced at the pollution abatement stages in the smelting process. This second model solves for an equilibrium among spatially separated markets, that determines the price and distribution of acid in each demand and supply region. The two models interact through the input each receives from the other. Thus, the smelter model uses the sulfuric acid price at each smelter to find optimal operational and investment decisions, whereas the sulfuric acid market model considers sulfuric acid output at the smelters as part of the supply input to find the price of this product at each smelter location. The solution given by the policy model is the global equilibrium obtained when this iterative process between the two models converges. Thus, the price of the sulfuric acid, which is the central component when deciding when and where to locate a sulfuric acid plant, is determined endogenously, rather than assumed exogenous as in most models of this type. Computational experiments show that expected profits associated with the copper industry can increase significantly when the problem is solved in aggregate, as compared with the smelters making their decisions independently. Several applications of the policy model are described.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.1.1.12797","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['pollution control', 'environmental regulations', 'sustainability']","The article discusses pollution control and environmental regulations, which indicate some awareness of sustainability issues.

We develop and test a model and solution methodology to exploit this flexibility during production planning.

Inventory is managed at various points of the chain (members), based on local information that each member observes and continuously updates. The key feature of our model is that it takes into account the ability of the members to observe subsets of the underlying state vector, and adopt their forecasting and replenishment policies accordingly. This enables us to model situations in which the members are privy to certain explanatory variables of the demand, with the latter possibly evolving according to a vector autoregressive time series. For each member, we identify an associated demand evolution model, for which we propose an adaptive inventory replenishment policy that utilizes the Kalman filter technique. We then provide a simple methodology for assessing the benefits of various types of information-sharing agreements between members of the supply chain. We also discuss inventory positioning and cost performance assessment in the supply chain. Our performance metrics and inventory target levels are usually presented in matrix forms, allowing them to accommodate a relatively large spectrum of linear demand models, and making them simple to implement.

We conduct the simulation in such a way that all sample paths of the system will eventually couple (i.e., become identical), regardless of their starting states. This coupling property is exploited to generate valid sample paths of the system by combining the information collected on consecutive time segments of the simulation. The efficiency of our approach depends heavily on the magnitude of the coupling times of the sample paths. We study how the expected coupling times depend on the system parameters through a variety of theoretical and numerical results. Our main results give conditions under which the expected coupling times grow slowly (no faster than linearly) with respect to the number of stations and buffer capacities in the system.

We consider a consumer-driven substitution problem with an arbitrary number of products under both centralized inventory management and competition. Substitution is modeled by letting the unsatisfied demand for a product flow to other products in deterministic proportions. We obtain analytically tractable solutions that facilitate comparisons between centralized and competitive inventory management under substitution. For the centralized problem we show that, when demand is multivariate normal, the total profit is decreasing in demand correlation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.2.329.12788","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and demand substitution without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As resource constraints become tighter, balancing these failure risks is more critical, less intuitive, and can benefit from the power of quantitative analysis. This paper describes the Advanced Programmatic Risk Analysis and Management model (APRAM), a decision-support framework for the management of the risk of failures of dependent engineering projects within programs. Our goal is to guide the management of the design, the development, and the budget of dependent projects. Considering first a single project, our approach is to optimize the use of the budget reserves and of the funds dedicated to the system itself for each possible budget allocation. This phase involves separate optimizations of the system design and a strategy for resolving development problems based on a chosen objective function. The model also allows checking that specified thresholds of maximum acceptable risks are met, and if not, indicates how much is required to satisfy them. It is then extended to include project dependencies within a program. Finally, it allows checking that the level of resources available is appropriate by computing the shadow \u201crisk cost\u201d of the budget constraint. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has supported the development of this model, so each step of APRAM is illustrated by the schematic case of an unmanned space program involving two dependent projects. Also, where applicable, we discuss our experiences working with the APRAM concepts for the management of unmanned space missions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.3.354.14961","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on quantitative analysis and risk management in engineering projects without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The principal incurs all costs for holding inventory and backordering demand. The agent dynamically controls the production rate at the server and incurs a convex production cost. The principal cannot monitor the production rate but can draw inference from increases in the inventory level. Furthermore, by making payments contingent on the inventory level, the principal motivates the agent to control the production rate in a manner that will minimize the principal's own total expected discounted cost. We show that an optimal incentive payment scheme consists of piece rates and inventory penalties that vary dynamically with the inventory level. This scheme coordinates the system if the agent is risk neutral. Otherwise, operational performance is degraded by the conflict in incentives between principal and agent. We identify some drivers of this agency loss: In addition to discounting and risk aversion in the agent's preferences, which are standard causes of friction in dynamic agency models, an increasing marginal cost of production and slack in the agent's capacity are also found to be lead contributors. Heavy traffic analysis supports these findings through closed-form expressions for the performance of the system under the optimal incentive scheme.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.3.371.14954","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production systems and incentive structures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Thus, even a small improvement in the quality of a crew schedule can have significant financial impact.

We address this limitation by delaying some of these earlier planning decisions\u2014specifically, key maintenance routing decisions\u2014and incorporating them within the crew scheduling problem. We present an extended crew pairing model that integrates crew scheduling and maintenance routing decisions. We prove theoretical results that allow us to improve the tractability of this model by decreasing the number of variables needed and by relaxing the integrality requirement of many of the remaining variables.

For a given time period, it must submit an offer stack, consisting of a fixed number of quantities of energy and prices at which it wants these quantities dispatched. We assume that the generator cannot offer enough power to substantially affect the market price, so the optimal response would be to offer energy at marginal cost. However, the market rules do not permit an arbitrary function, so the problem is to find an offer stack approximating marginal cost in a way that maximizes its profit.

The demand rate of each retailer depends on all of the retailers' prices, or alternatively, the price each retailer can charge for its product depends on the sales volumes targeted by all of the retailers. The supplier replenishes his inventory through orders (purchases, production runs) from an outside source with ample supply. From there, the goods are transferred to the retailers. Carrying costs are incurred for all inventories, while all supplier orders and transfers to the retailers incur fixed and variable costs. We first characterize the solution to the centralized system in which all retailer prices, sales quantities and the complete chain-wide replenishment strategy are determined by a single decision maker, e.g., the supplier. We then proceed with the decentralized system. Here, the supplier chooses a wholesale pricing scheme; the retailers respond to this scheme by each choosing all of his policy variables. We distinguish systematically between the case of Bertrand and Cournot competition. In the former, each retailer independently chooses his retail price as well as a replenishment strategy; in the latter, each of the retailers selects a sales target, again in combination with a replenishment strategy. Finally, the supplier responds to the retailers' choices by implementing his own cost-minimizing replenishment strategy. We construct a perfect coordination mechanism. In the case of Cournot competition, the mechanism applies a discount from a basic wholesale price, based on the sum of three discount components, which are a function of (1) annual sales volume, (2) order quantity, and (3) order frequency, respectively.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.3.409.14957","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory management in a competitive retail environment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, the discrete representation must be of acceptable quality to ensure that a most\u2013preferred solution identified by a decision maker is of acceptable quality. Recently, attributes for measuring the quality of discrete representations have been proposed. Although discrete representations can be obtained in many different ways, and their quality evaluated afterwards, the ultimate goal should be to find such representations so as to conform to specified quality standards. We present a method that can find discrete representations of the efficient set according to a specified level of quality. The procedure is based on mathematical programming tools and can be implemented relatively easily when the domain of interest is a polyhedron. The nonconvexity of the efficient set is dealt with through a coordinated decomposition approach.

External demand is met from the available finished goods inventory maintained in front of the most downstream facility; unsatisfied demand is backlogged. Every stage orders from its upstream facility, thus production is constrained by the local production capacity and the availability of upstream inventory. We propose production policies in two separate cases: (1) when each facility has information about its local inventory only, and (2) when each facility has knowledge of the total downstream inventory. In case (1) the proposed policy guarantees that stockout probabilities at each stage stay bounded below given constants (service level constraints). In case (2) the proposed policy minimizes total expected inventory cost subject to desirable service-level constraints. In both cases the parameters of the proposed policies are obtained analytically based on large deviations asymptotics, which leads to drastic computational savings compared to simulation. An important feature of our model is that it accommodates autocorrelated demand and service processes, both critical features of modern failure-prone manufacturing systems. We demonstrate that detailed distributional information on demand and service processes, which is incorporated into large deviations asymptotics, is critical in inventory control decisions. We discuss extensions to a multiclass setting and to a model where unsatisfied demand is lost instead of backordered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.3.437.14958","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control in supply chains without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consequently, quantitative models for economic capacity expansion planning have been the subject of intense research. However, much of the work in this area has been restricted to linear cost models and/or limited degree of uncertainty to make the problems analytically tractable. This paper addresses a stochastic capacity expansion problem where the economies-of-scale in expansion costs are handled via fixed-charge cost functions, and forecast uncertainties in the problem parameters are explicitly considered by specifying a set of scenarios. The resulting formulation is a multistage stochastic integer program. We develop a fast, linear-programming-based, approximation scheme that exploits the decomposable structure and is guaranteed to produce feasible solutions for this problem. Through a probabilistic analysis, we prove that the optimality gap of the heuristic solution almost surely vanishes asymptotically as the problem size increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.3.461.14960","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity expansion and stochastic programming without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

This study provides such an investigation, focusing on the logistic system used to manage consumable service parts for weapon systems in the U.S. military. Our findings, based on interviews and rigorous analysis of part attribute and performance data, suggest that in practice a part's service level is negatively affected by an item's cost and is less affected by attributes such as its priority code. We introduce a simple inventory model to explain our empirical findings and explore how variations in item attributes can interact with an inventory policy to affect system performance. Based on this model, we recommend using explicit service-level targets for priority categories to achieve performance consistent with part priority.

We scale the queue by letting the potential (congestion-free) arrival rate be proportional to the number of servers, n, and letting n increase. We let the actual arrival rate with n servers be of the form \u03bbn=f(\u03ben)n, where f is a strictly-decreasing continuous function and \u03ben is a steady-state congestion measure. We consider several alternative congestion measures, such as the mean waiting time and the probability of delay. We show, under minor regularity conditions, that for each n there is a unique equilibrium pair (\u03bb*n, \u03be*n) such that \u03be*n is the steady-state congestion associated with arrival rate \u03bb*n and \u03bb*n=f(\u03be*n)n. Moreover, we show that, as n increases, the queue with the equilibrium arrival rate \u03bb*n is brought into heavy traffic, but the three different heavy-traffic regimes for multiserver queues identified by Halfin and Whitt (1981) each can arise depending on the congestion measure used. In considerable generality, there is asymptotic service efficiency: the server utilization approaches one as n increases. Under the assumption of growing congestion-dependent demand, the service efficiency can be achieved even if there is significant uncertainty about the potential demand, because the actual arrival rate adjusts to the congestion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.4.531.16093","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue performance and congestion without any reference to social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain where a supplier makes deliveries to several manufacturers, who also make deliveries to customers. The objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and delivery cost, using several classical scheduling objectives. This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, each of which is delivered to the next downstream stage as a single shipment. For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or that of the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable. The total system cost minimization problem of a supplier and manufacturer who make cooperative decisions is also considered. We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective. Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.4.566.16106","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain scheduling and cost minimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2003","51","4","Seyed M.

A linear programming model with 0\u20131 variables describes the decision process. Solution strategies involve strengthening of the model, lifting some of the constraints, and applying Lagrangean relaxation.

(1999). This class of problems seeks to determine a least-cost layout of departments having various size and area requirements within a rectangular building, and it is challenging even for small instances. The difficulty arises from the disjunctive constraints that prevent departmental overlaps and the nonlinear area constraints for each department, which existing models have failed to approximate with adequate accuracy. We develop several modeling and algorithmic enhancements that are demonstrated to produce more accurate solutions while also decreasing the solution effort required. We begin by deriving a novel polyhedral outer approximation scheme that can provide as accurate a representation of the area requirements as desired. We also design alternative methods for reducing problem symmetry, evaluate the performance of several classes of valid inequalities, explore the construction of partial convex hull representations for the disjunctive constraints, and investigate judicious branching variable selection priority schemes. The results indicate a substantial increase in the accuracy of the layout produced, while at the same time providing a dramatic reduction in computational effort. In particular, three previously unsolved test problems from the literature for which Meller et al.'s algorithm terminated prematurely after 24 cpu hours of computation (on a SUN Ultra 2 workstation with 390 MB RAM) with respective optimality gaps of 10.14%, 26.45%, and 40%, have been solved to exact optimality with reasonable effort using our proposed approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.4.629.16096","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of facility layout optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

A costcis incurred if a new arrival is blocked from entering the system by the gatekeeper, while a larger cost K is incurred if an admitted customer finds all servers busy and therefore has to leave the system. The key assumption is that the gatekeeper is informed when an admitted customer finds all servers busy, but is not informed when served customers depart. Assuming an exponential service distribution, we show that, in the case of a single server, a threshold-type policy that blocks for a certain amount of time after a new arrival is admitted is optimal. When there are multiple servers, we propose two types of heuristic policies. We analytically compute the best policy of the first type, and use simulation to estimate that of the other.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.4.645.16103","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of a queueing system without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Models known from chaos and fractals, such as nonlinear analysis of coupled differential equations, cellular automata, or coupled maps, can generate behavior which indeed resembles a phase transition in the flow behavior. Other measurements point out that the same behavior could be generated by geometrical constraints of the scenario. This paper looks at some of the empirical evidence, but mostly focuses on different modeling approaches. The theory of traffic jam dynamics is reviewed in some detail, starting from the well-established theory of kinematic waves and then veering into the area of phase transitions. One aspect of the theory of phase transitions is that, by changing one single parameter, a system can be moved from displaying a phase transition to not displaying a phase transition. This implies that models for traffic can be tuned so that they display a phase transition or not.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.5.681.16755","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling approaches related to traffic flow and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The objective is to minimize the cost of the deviation. The cost of deviation is typically a convex function. We propose algorithms here that are faster than all known algorithms for the problem. Our algorithm's run time for any convex inverse spanning-tree problem is O(nm log2n) for a graph on n nodes and m edges plus the time required to find the minima of the n convex deviation functions. This not only improves on the complexity of previously known algorithms for the general problem, but also for algorithms devised for special cases. For the case when the objective is weighted absolute deviation, Sokkalingam et al. (1999) devised an algorithm with run time O(n2m log(nC)) for C the maximum edge weight. For the sum of absolute deviations our algorithm runs in time O(n2 log n), matching the run time of a recent (Ahuja and Orlin 2000) improvement for this case.

We report computational results on benchmark instances chosen from the OR library comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and several commonly used heuristic methods. These results suggest that for problems of moderate to high multiplicity, the proposed algorithm outperforms these methods, and for very high multiplicity the overperformance is dramatic. For problems of low to moderate multiplicity, however, the relative errors of the heuristic methods are comparable to those of the proposed algorithm, and the best of these methods performs better overall than the proposed method.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.51.5.798.16748","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for job-shop scheduling with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2003","51","5","Justin BoeselJustin Boeselboesel@mitre.orgThe MITRE Corporation, 1820 Dolley Madison Boulevard, McLean, Virginia 22102Search for more papers by this author, Barry L.

We consider a firm that sells an innovative product with a given market potential. The firm may not be able to meet demand due to capacity constraints. For such firms, we present a new model of demand, modified from the original model of Bass, to capture the effect of unmet past demand on future demand. We use this model to find production and sales plans that maximize profit during the lifetime of the product in a firm with a fixed production capacity. We conduct an extensive numerical study to establish that the trivial, myopic sales plan that sells the maximal amount possible at each time instant is not necessarily optimal. We show that a heuristic \u201cbuild-up\u201d policy, in which the firm does not sell at all for a period of time and builds up enough inventory to never lose sales once it begins selling, is a robust approximation to the optimal policy. Specializing to a lost-sales setting, we prove that the optimal sales plan is indeed of the \u201cbuild-up\u201d type. We explicitly characterize the optimal build-up period and analytically derive the optimal initial inventory and roll-out delay.

In some applications, simulation effort is of greater value when applied to early time steps rather than shared equally among all time steps; this occurs, for example, when discounting renders immediate rewards or cashflows more important than those in the future. This suggests that deliberately stopping some paths early may improve efficiency. We formulate and solve the problem of optimal allocation of resources to time horizons with the objective of minimizing variance subject to a cost constraint. The solution has a simple characterization in terms of the convex hull of points defined by the covariance matrix of the cashflows. We also develop two ways to enhance variance reduction through early stopping. One takes advantage of the statistical theory of missing data.

Flexibility here means that each server may be capable of performing service at several different classes in the network. We assume that the interarrival times and the service times are independent and identically distributed, and that routing is probabilistic. We also allow for server switching times, which we assume to be independent and identically distributed. We deduce the value of a tight upper bound on the achievable capacity by equating the capacity of the queueing network model with that of a limiting deterministic fluid model. The maximal capacity of the deterministic model is given by the solution to a linear programming problem that also provides optimal allocations of servers to classes. We construct particular server assignment policies, called generalized round-robin policies, that guarantee that the capacity of the queueing network will be arbitrarily close to the computed upper bound.

Briefly, trust is a social lubricant that reduces the friction costs of existing trade and/or serves to increase the scope of trade. In contrast to this universalistic view, we posit that the performance of trust-based governance is contingent on the ability of trading partners to \u201cread\u201d each other and learn about counterpart behavior. These information-processing abilities allow firms to assess partner trustworthiness better, which reduces the risk of misplaced trust. The increased efficacy of communication and learning from one another also enables them to better capitalize from the adaptation and revision possibilities uncovered through trust-based governance during the task-execution phase. Given the central role of these cognitive requirements, we assess these contingent effects with data from a knowledge-intensive task setting. Using a sample of 129 firms that have engaged outside contractors on client-sponsored R&D projects, we find strong support for our thesis. Specifically, we find that trust-based governance has a larger positive impact on task performance when the client is more skilled at understanding the outsourced tasks at hand, the task itself requires skills that are relatively more readily taught (less tacit), and the task itself is organized in parallel with work being done at the contractor as well as the client. As a corollary, we also find that firms adopt trust-based governance to a greater extent as these information-processing abilities increase, as well as with the colocation of the contractor and client.

Concerns about trust have been identified as a barrier to such businesses' success. This research explores how consumers' initial trust judgments about organizations they encounter on the Web may be influenced by hypertext links from trusted websites and associations with the more trust-inducing traditional retail channel. This paper develops and tests a cognitive model of the trust transfer process, arguing that trust is transferred across hypertext links based on the perceived interaction and similarity of the linked organizations, and that institution-based trust is transferred from the traditional shopping channel to a Web-based organization based on evidence that the Web-based organization has a physical store. An experimental study shows that a hypertext link from one website to another increased the extent to which the linked organizations were perceived to have a business relationship and be similar, and these perceptions had a positive influence on trusting beliefs regarding the linked site. Associating with the physical shopping channel by showing a picture of a building on a website increased the extent to which subjects reported intention to buy from the site. The study provided empirical evidence that trusting beliefs regarding the website had a significant positive effect on intention to buy from it.

Our findings indicate that perceived trustworthiness reduces transaction costs and is correlated with greater information sharing in supplier-buyer relationships. Moreover, the findings suggest that the value created for transactors, in terms of lower transaction costs, may be substantial. In particular, we found that the least-trusted automaker spent significantly more of its face-to-face interaction time with suppliers on contracting and haggling when compared to the most trusted automaker. This translated into procurement (transaction) costs that were five times higher for the least trusted automaker. Finally, we argue that trust is unique as a governance mechanism because it not only minimizes transaction costs, but also has a mutually causal relationship with information sharing, which also creates value in the exchange relationship. Other governance mechanisms (e.g., contracts, financial hostages) are necessary costs incurred to prevent opportunistic behavior, but do not create value beyond transaction cost minimization. Our findings provide empirical evidence that trustworthiness lowers transaction costs and may be an important source of competitive advantage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.1.57.12806","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['trustworthiness', 'transaction costs', 'information sharing']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of trust and transaction costs in supplier-buyer relationships without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

This requires organizations, and the individuals they are comprised of, to be both trustworthy and trusting. An important question is whether societal culture influences the tendency of individuals and organizations to trust. Based largely on Yamagishi's (1994, 1998a, b) theories explaining trust, commitment, and in-group bias in collectivist cultures, this study examines potential differences in levels of trust between individualist and collectivist cultures.

We first study differences in how individuals from individualist and collectivist societies trust ingroups versus out-groups. This provides an important foundation for hypotheses regarding differences in individual propensities to trust and two measures of organizational trust: internal trust (trust within the organization) and external trust (an organization's trust for suppliers, customers, etc.).

We propose that conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle is a powerful way of integrating the diverse trust literature and distilling generalizable implications for how trust affects organizing. We develop the notion of trust as an organizing principle by specifying structuring and mobilizing as two sets of causal pathways through which trust influences several important properties of organizations. We further describe specific mechanisms within structuring and mobilizing that influence interaction patterns and organizational processes. The principal aim of the framework is to advance the literature by connecting the psychological and sociological micro-foundations of trust with the macro-bases of organizing. The paper concludes by demonstrating how the framework can be applied to yield novel insights into traditional views of organizations and to stimulate original and innovative avenues of organizational research that consider both the benefits and downsides of trust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.1.91.12814","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['trust', 'organizational processes', 'diverse trust literature']","The article discusses trust in organizations, emphasizing its role in structuring and mobilizing, which hints at social dynamics within organizations.

Our analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of observed innovative activity was based on ideas sourced from outside the focal firm, and that innovations diffused very quickly across competing banks. As such, there were no periods during which any bank had proprietary possession of a major product or process innovation. We therefore ask how the banks' innovative activity could affect their relative financial performance positions. We answer this question by developing a set of hypotheses that relate specific features of their histories of innovative activity to their current financial performance. These hypotheses are tested using a detailed data set describing 1,297 modifications made to products and services, distribution technologies, and back-office processes within a sample of Australian retail banks over the sample period. Our results provide support for the general position that establishing an attractive competitive position depends on the specific history of a firm's innovative activity. Banks that undertook more innovative activity, that were more consistent in that activity, and whose composition of activity was somewhat differentiated from the industry norm tended to display superior financial performance. Rather than looking solely for internally generated, inimitable innovations to deliver competitive advantage, these results suggest that active and consistent innovative activity that is somewhat differentiated from competitors can also deliver superior financial performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.2.107.14990","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on innovative activity and competitive advantage in the banking sector without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, except for some studies of family businesses that lack direct applicability to nonfamily CEO succession, the past studies of succession have not examined the very first succession event in a firm, when the Founder-CEO is replaced, on a large-scale basis. The critical differences between later-stage succession and Founder-CEO succession include the higher level of attachment between Founder-CEOs and the firms they create, the much larger equity holdings of Founder-CEOs (which give them much more control of the firm), the fact that many Founder-CEOs remain in the firm (even though it is being run by their successors), and the fact that nearly all early-stage succession events involve outside successors (in contrast to later-stage succession research, which has focused on the insider-outsider distinction). These differences make it hard to extrapolate from later-stage succession findings to Founder-CEO succession. Therefore, in order to examine Founder-CEO succession, I used field research and grounded theory building to study the factors that should affect Founder-CEO succession in Internet start-ups. I find that there are two central intertemporal events that may affect Founder-CEO succession: The completion of product development and the raising of each round of financing from outside investors. I develop testable hypotheses about how each of these events affect the rate of succession, and then test these hypotheses using an event-history analysis of a unique dataset containing the succession histories of 202 Internet firms. My findings point to multiple \u201cparadoxes of success\u201d in which the Founder-CEO's success at achieving critical milestones actually causes the chance of Founder-CEO succession to rise dramatically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on CEO succession in entrepreneurial contexts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Personnel new to a firm may broaden the firm's knowledge stock, but may not disrupt the firm's ways of organizing. Instead, personnel inflows may contribute to the retention of a firm's traditional ways of organizing. This study tracks the flow of personnel within and across organizational boundaries (intrafirm and interfirm flows) and geographic boundaries (local and cross-border flows) for multiunit banks operating in the Foreign Exchange Trade Industry from 1973\u20131993. We test how a firm's retention activity responds to inflows of personnel from different sources (e.g., intrafirm, interfirm, local, and cross-border). The findings show that inflows of personnel from different sources increase a firm's retention activity. Rather than adopting changes in behavior in response to an influx of personnel from within or across spatial boundaries, firms in the foreign exchange industry tend to retain their existing ways of organizing. Personnel inflows from a combination of sources, such as local intrafirm, cross-border intrafirm, local interfirm, and cross-border interfirm, also positively affect retention. By examining the differences in the magnitudes of these effects, we empirically show that considering different sources of personnel inflows in combination is worthwhile.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.2.173.14997","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['personnel mobility', 'knowledge retention', 'organizational boundaries']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of knowledge retention and personnel mobility without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper shows that such undersampling of failure can contribute to a variety of false beliefs about effective management. Simply by observing existing organizations, laymen may get a misleading picture of the determinants of corporate performance. In particular, risky practices, even if they are unrelated to performance in the full population of organizations, may seem to be positively related to performance in a sample of survivors. I argue that this bias frequently implies that the organizational theories of managers and other observers of organizations will be systematically biased. Observations of existing organizations will show that unreliable, uninformed practices and practices that involve concentrated resource allocation are superior to reliable, informed practices or practices that involve diversified resource allocation.

Prior research has shown that firms tend to have successful IPOs if they go public with the endorsement of a prestigious lead underwriter. This paper examines the antecedents to receiving endorsement by a prestigious underwriter and links this to the experience base of a firm's upper echelon. We theorize that the amount and type of upper echelon experience serve as important symbols of a young firm's legitimacy to critical outsiders. We introduce a typology of upper echelon experience that distinguishes between upper echelon upstream, horizontal, and downstream employment-based affiliations and suggest that these different types of upper echelon affiliations allay different types of endorser concerns regarding firm legitimacy, affecting the endorsement process. Further, we theorize that the relationships between upper echelon experience and investment bank prestige will be moderated by technological uncertainty. We test our assertions on a comprehensive sample of public and private biotechnology firms that were founded between 1961 and 1994 and that went public between 1979 and 1996. Analyses of the five-year career histories of the over 3,200 executives and directors that make up the upper echelons of these firms show that firms with upper echelons with affiliations with prominent downstream organizations (i.e., pharmaceutical and/or healthcare companies) and with prominent horizontal organizations (i.e., biotechnology companies) are more likely to attract the endorsement of a prestigious investment bank. We also find that the greater the range of upper echelon affiliations across the categories of upstream, horizontal, and downstream affiliations, the more prestigious the firm's lead underwriter. We also find that these latter results are moderated by technological uncertainty.

Our predictions build on knowledge-based, internalization, and evolutionary theories of foreign direct investment. We argue that the tacitness of technology has an inverted-U effect on the propensity to undertake foreign investment. We also expect that as a firm learns about a technology, it will become more likely to make foreign investments. We examine two forms of learning: that which accumulates as a function of the number of plants previously built by the firm (transfer-based learning), and that which accumulates as a function of time since the firm started using a technology (time-based learning). We investigate empirical effects in a sample of investments in the memory segment of the semiconductor industry. Our predictions about the curvilinear effect of tacitness are supported. The results also suggest that learning is a matter of taking time to become acquainted with the use of the technology, and of gaining experience through successive foreign plant investments.

In this paper, I link the misunderstandings between engineers, technicians, and assemblers on a production floor to their work contexts, and demonstrate how members of these communities overcome such problems by cocreating common ground that transforms their understanding of the product and the production process. In particular, I find that the communities' knowledge-sharing difficulties are rooted in differences in their language, the locus of their practice, and their conceptualization of the product. When communication problems arise, if members of these communities provide solutions which invoke the differences in the work contexts and create common ground between the communities, they can transform the understandings of others and generate a richer understanding of the product and the problems they face.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.3.312.15162","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['knowledge-sharing', 'communication', 'understanding', 'communities']","The article discusses the transformation of understanding and knowledge-sharing among different occupational communities, which reflects themes of collaboration and communication.

However, this paper argues that such \u201cinternal hybrids,\u201d particularly in their radical forms, are inherently hard to successfully design and implement because of a fundamental incentive problem of establishing credible managerial commitments to not intervene in delegated decision making. This theme is developed and illustrated, using the case of the world-leading hearing aids producer, Oticon. In the beginning of the 1990s, Oticon became famous for its radical internal hybrid, the \u201cspaghetti organization.\u201d Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti organization as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by organizational means, neglecting, however, that about a decade later the spaghetti organization has given way to a more traditional matrix organization. In contrast, an organizational economics interpretation of Oticon organizational changes is developed. This lens suggests that a strong liability of the spaghetti organization was the above incentive problem: Frequent managerial meddling with delegated rights led to a severe loss of motivation, and arguably caused the change to a more structured organization. Refutable implications are developed, and the discussion is broadened to more general issues of economic organization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.3.331.15166","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['entrepreneurialism', 'motivation', 'managerial commitments']","The article discusses organizational structures and managerial practices but lacks a strong focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Every element of the research process is affected if the research questions call for team-based data collection and interpretation over a lengthy period of time. It is unusual for a team of scholars from different disciplines to work together, not because the need doesn't exist, but because the mechanisms for doing so are not well established. We draw from the writings of scholars in the fields of research methodology, team and work-group design, and project management to inform our thinking on the subject. The work presented here is based on the authors' experiences during 1995\u20131999 as members of the Radical Innovation Research Program (RIRP). The RIRP is an ongoing multidisciplinary study of the development and management of radical innovations in established firms. Here, we do not describe the findings or insights associated with the content of the study, radical innovation, which is surely a complex managerial phenomenon. Rather, we focus on the processes used to conduct the research that were affected by the need for a multidisciplinary research team. A framework is presented for thinking about managing such a project. Challenges that we encountered within this framework are identified. Mechanisms we used (or, in some cases, wish we had used in retrospect) for confronting those challenges are also described. Throughout, we compare our study objectives and resultant methodological design choices with those of other multidisciplinary research teams that are by now well known in the organizational management literature. Our objective is to help researchers who are considering launching interdisciplinary, longitudinal studies of organizational processes as they plan and manage those pursuits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.4.353.17485","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['interdisciplinary', 'team-based', 'collaboration', 'methodological design']","The article discusses the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in research, which touches on themes of diversity in academic perspectives.

However, drawing from prior research that shows that people with high social status are perceived more favorably than people with low status, we also hypothesize that benefits of organizational citizenship are more likely to accrue to employees in high, as compared to low, status groups. Data were from 448 employees of a U.S. manufacturing firm. As expected, citizenship was more strongly and negatively related to perceived victimization for whites as compared to African-Americans. However, contrary to our prediction, citizenship was more strongly related to perceived victimization among employees with low, as compared to high, hierarchical status.

Specifically, the extent and length of such externalization would negatively relate to internal workers' trust in, commitment toward, and psychological contract with organizations. The premise for this argument is that internal workers may view externalization as an indicator of the organization's low-level commitment to them. Internal workers would reciprocate by decreasing their attachment to the organization. Externalization might also be seen as violating the psychological contract between employees and employers, since externalization is associated with slowed upward mobility and poor work support for internal workers. However, organizational actions that indicate commitment toward employees would mitigate such negative effects. I posit that externalization would be viewed less negatively both by workers who believe they have secure jobs, and by those who supervise and train others. These hypotheses were tested with data collected from 256 internal workers in three organizations. Results indicate that both the extent and length of externalization are negatively related to internal workers' attitudes, especially for those of internal workers with fewer supervisory responsibilities. However, contrary to the hypotheses, the relationship is also more negative for internal workers with high job security.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.4.386.17488","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['employment externalization', 'psychological contract', 'commitment', 'internal workers']","The article discusses the impact of employment externalization on internal workers' attitudes, touching on themes of employee commitment and the psychological contract, which align with moderate woke themes related to organizational ethics and worker welfare."],["2003","14","4","John StephanJohn Stephanjstephan@fau.eduFlorida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Road, P.O.

To create this deterrent capability, however, firms must enter each others' markets, which is just the kind of action that the deterrent is supposed to limit. This study explores the questions: Under what conditions are firms likely to behave aggressively toward their multimarket rivals by entering their markets and when will they engage in mutual forbearance? We describe how the effect of multimarket contact on the market-entry moves of a firm changes as the level of contact a firm has with its rivals increases. We draw on competitive intelligence and decision-making theory to argue that the competitive advantages associated with multimarket contact are supplemented by the fact that a firm's multimarket competitors serve as a readily available model to reduce the uncertainty associated with market-entry decisions. We hypothesize that these factors lead firms to prefer, up to the point where forbearance concerns become paramount, to enter the markets in which their multipoint rivals already compete. We also argue that once multimarket contact levels reach the point where forbearance begins to operate, these levels also serve to stabilize the structure through better competitive intelligence, with the result that the propensity of a firm to enter into additional markets of its multimarket rivals declines. We then extend multimarket theory by focusing on the role of the CEO. Specifically, we argue that newer and longer-tenured CEOs are likely to face different influences on their preferences for particular competitive actions. We test hypotheses that link the likelihood that CEOs will abide by the mutual interdependencies that their firm's multimarket ties represent to their tenure in the CEO position. Our findings produce support for an inverted-U-shaped relationship between multipoint contact and market entry. We also find evidence that longer-tenured CEOs are guided by their firm's multimarket relationships. Newer CEOs, however, do not seem to adopt a forbearance approach toward their firm's multimarket competitors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.4.403.17484","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive strategies and market entry decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Organizational Constraints on Trust in Boundary Spanners","We present a view of trust in boundary spanners as explained by the extent of role autonomy, a multidimensional concept that reflects the discretion that agents have in interpreting and enacting their roles. We argue that, in a buyer-supplier context, purchasing managers will be trusted to a greater extent by supplier representatives when they are free from constraints that limit their ability to interpret their boundary-spanning roles. We conceptualize and measure three key components of role autonomy: Functional influence, tenure, and clan culture. Taken together, these components of role autonomy shape and define the purchasing manager's willingness and capacity to make and uphold commitments to supplier representatives. Role autonomy permits purchasing managers to engage in discretionary behaviors that allow supplier representatives to learn about their underlying motives and intentions. We test hypotheses linking the components of role autonomy to trust on a sample of 119 buyer-supplier relationships. We use a dyadic research design that combines data from purchasing managers and supplier representatives. The results suggest that granting purchasing managers greater autonomy enhances supplier representative trust in purchasing managers. By drawing attention to role autonomy as a feature of organizations that influences trust we highlight the importance of organizational context in contributing to a deeper understanding of trust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.4.422.17487","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'role autonomy', 'organizational context']","The article discusses the concept of trust and role autonomy within organizational contexts, which touches on ethical organizational practices but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or DEI themes.

The Effects of Racial Composition on Voluntary Turnover","This study examines the relationship between racial composition and individual, voluntary turnover for minorities (i.e., Asians, blacks, and Hispanics) in a large organization. We present a critical test for two sets of contrasting predictions. The first draws on similarity attraction, social contact, and social identity theories to suggest that working with racially similar others enhances the work environment in terms of perceived career opportunities, mentoring relationships, and network ties, all of which would increase the likelihood of remaining in an organization. The contrasting predictions draw on group competition and group threat theories and propose that working with racially similar others might increase competition for resources and generate a backlash effect against minorities that would induce their turnover. We suggest the paradox that these two approaches might be compatible if the effect of demographic composition is nonlinear. Our data analyses show that individuals' likelihood of turnover decreases as the proportion of employees in a job from one's own race increases. Furthermore, this relationship is nonlinear: Members of minority groups with very small representation benefited more from the increased presence of their own race than minorities who already had a substantial presence. This finding suggests a potential backlash effect at higher minority proportions. Results also show that turnover decreases as the proportion of employees from one's own race increases in the level above an employee's job. Overall, these findings suggest that working with others of the same race reduces the likelihood of minority exits. Interestingly, the proportion of other minorities in a job has a marginally significant, negative effect on employees' voluntary turnover. Thus, increasing racial diversity from one's own race and other minorities appears to strengthen minority workforce retention.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.5.483.16768","","OS","Management & Organizations","8","['racial composition', 'minorities', 'diversity', 'work environment', 'career opportunities']","The article focuses on the impact of racial composition on minority turnover, emphasizing themes of diversity and the experiences of marginalized groups in the workplace.

This model provides a game-theoretical basis for contingent organizational design by relating empirical observations of real organizations to the solution of a rational choice model based on game theory. We constructed a multiple-player, noncooperative game in which players have full knowledge of, and universal communication access to, each other. These players allocate the scarce resource of their attention among potential interaction partners. It struck us that this game sometimes did and sometimes did not have a \u201ccore,\u201d i.e., a confluence of individual optima (Nash equilibrium) that was also optimal for the whole group. Some circumstances allow the best structure to emerge from many individual decisions, whereas other circumstances require the imposition of structured communication channels by a central decision maker. Strong management control of communication structure adds no value in business environments where the game has a \u201ccore\u201d i.e., where a centrally imposed optimum would dictate the same communications patterns as those defined by the Nash equilibrium that emerges spontaneously when each participant optimizes locally. Trade in an ideal market is the iconic example of such environments. In our model, other combinations of conditions fail to yield a core, even though a single stable Nash equilibrium always exists. The difference between aggregate effectiveness at the Nash equilibrium and the maximal feasible aggregate effectiveness that could be centrally dictated is the value that management can provide through enforcing the globally optimum communication regime. The predictions of this simple model about the conditions that favor more- or less-structured communications agree surprisingly well with accepted organizational contingency theory. Our simple model thus provides a sound theoretical foundation for many aspects of contingent organizational design.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.5.541.16764","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on a mathematical model related to communication structures within organizations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Science helps us to understand organized systems, from an outsider position, as empirical objects. The humanities contribute to understanding, and critically reflecting on, the human experience of actors inside organized practices. This paper argues that, in view of the persistent relevance gap between theory and practice, organization studies should be broadened to include design as one of its primary modes of engaging in research. Design is characterized by its emphasis on solution finding, guided by broader purposes and ideal target systems. Moreover, design develops, and draws on, design propositions that are tested in pragmatic experiments and grounded in organization science. This study first explores the main differences and synergies between science and design, and explores how and why the design discipline has largely moved away from academia to other sites in the economy. The argument then turns to the genealogy of design methodologies in organization and management studies. Subsequently, this paper explores the circular design methodology that serves to illustrate the nature of design research, that is, the pragmatic focus on actionable knowledge as well as the key role of ideal target systems in design processes. Finally, the author proposes a framework for communication and collaboration between the science and design modes, and argues that scholars in organization studies can guide human beings in the process of designing and developing their organizations toward more humane, participative, and productive futures. In this respect, the organization discipline can make a difference.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.5.558.16769","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['design', 'human experience', 'humane', 'participative']","The article emphasizes a shift towards more humane and participative organizational practices, suggesting a focus on the human experience within organizations.

I discovered that individuals primarily construe their role models along positive/negative, global/specific, close/distant, and hierarchically superior/peer-subordinate dimensions, and that across the career span, the tendency to observe role models did not change. Rather, the emphasis placed on different dimensions of role models changes. Early-stage respondents who are working on creating a viable self-concept were more likely to construe their role models as positive, close, and sources of a range of attributes. Middle- and late-stage respondents were more likely to see their role models as sources of specific, and often negative, attributes. The study suggests that these observed patterns are related to individuals' increasing confidence in their professional self-concept. In early stages, individuals pay attention to role models to create a viable self-concept; in middle stages, they seek to refine their self-concept, and in late stages, they seek to enhance and affirm their self-concept.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.5.591.16767","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['role models', 'self-concept', 'attributes']","The article discusses the concept of role models and self-concept development, which touches on personal growth and professional identity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, geographically distributed teams, whose members are not collocated and must often communicate via technology, are growing in prevalence. Studies from the field are beginning to suggest that geographically distributed teams operate differently and experience different outcomes than traditional teams. For example, empirical studies suggest that distributed teams experience high levels of conflict. These empirical studies offer rich and valuable descriptions of this conflict, but they do not systematically identify the mechanisms by which conflict is engendered in distributed teams. In this paper, we develop a theory-based explanation of how geographical distribution provokes team-level conflict. We do so by considering the two characteristics that distinguish distributed teams from traditional ones: Namely, we examine how being distant from one's team members and relying on technology to mediate communication and collaborative work impacts team members. Our analysis identifies antecedents to conflict that are unique to distributed teams. We predict that conflict of all types (task, affective, and process) will be detrimental to the performance of distributed teams, a result that is contrary to much research on traditional teams. We also investigate conflict as a dynamic process to determine how teams might mitigate these negative impacts over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.6.615.24872","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['conflict', 'distributed teams', 'communication', 'collaboration']","The article discusses conflict in distributed teams, which touches on organizational dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Specifically, using the case of the Linux kernel development project, we build a model of community-based, evolutionary knowledge creation to study how thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the Internet to produce a knowledge-intensive, innovative product of high quality. By comparing and contrasting the Linux model with the traditional/commercial model of software development and firmbased knowledge creation efforts, we show how the proposed model of knowledge creation expands beyond the boundary of the firm. Our model suggests that the product development process can be effectively organized as an evolutionary process of learning driven by criticism and error correction. We conclude by offering some theoretical implications of our community-based model of knowledge creation for the literature of organizational learning, community life, and the uses of knowledge in society.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.6.633.24866","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['community-based', 'collaborate', 'knowledge creation', 'organizational boundaries']","The article discusses a community-based model of knowledge creation that emphasizes collaboration across organizational and geographical boundaries, reflecting themes of inclusivity and collective effort.

Firms are highly dependent on their immediate institutional and competitive environments. The present paper further explores this issue by focusing on the spatial and temporal sources of industry heterogeneity. Our goal is threefold. First, we explore founding rates as a function of spatial density, arguing that density-dependent processes occur along a geographic gradient ranging from proximate, to neighboring, to more distant contexts. Second, we show how multiple, local evolutionary clocks shape such entrepreneurial activity. Third, we provide evidence on how diffusion processes are directly affected by social contagion, with new organizational forms spreading through movements of individuals.

This challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. How should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? While it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. With the help of an agentbased simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.6.650.24840","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational structures', 'exploration', 'adaptation']","The article focuses primarily on organizational structures and competitive advantage without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that effectiveness in Russia relies more on adaptability and flexibility than it does in the United States. Furthermore, the legacy of the Communist era forces firms in Russia to deal with a workforce with a unique time perspective and a unique set of subcultures that often undermine attempts at coordination and integration.

The model incorporates the individual and additive effects of firm, team, and industry levels of managerial experience and the conflict effects of combining multiple levels of experience. Theoretical arguments are tested in a longitudinal sample of entrepreneurial firms from the medical and surgical instruments industry. The results indicate that founders' participation in the top management team and managers' past experience in the industry contribute to the competence of the team in seizing new growth opportunities. The results also show that, because of conflict effects, the positive effect of founders' participation in the management team on the rate of growth weakens as either the shared team-specific experience or industry-specific managerial experience in the team increases. For practitioners, the most important implication is that for sustained growth, entrepreneurial firms should learn to balance different levels of managerial experience in the top management team. One way to achieve this balance is to retain valuable founder resources in the team while avoiding high levels of shared team-specific experience and industry-specific managerial experience.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.6.707.24867","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['competence', 'experience', 'management']","The article focuses primarily on managerial competence and growth without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Though the effects of this standard on quality management and on performance improvement have been widely debated, there is little knowledge of how the managers and employees who are asked to implement and maintain it perceive the ISO 9000 standards or resist its use. This study will thus attempt to analyze this perception and resistance with regard to both the standard and the certification process. So as to avoid the traditional and idealised view of this standard, whose commercial stakes often give rise to uncritical statements, almost 50 interviews were conducted outside of the workplace. The results of these interviews revealed highly contrasting attitudes that were frequently critical of the ISO 9000 system, which was often given only superficial support. A qualitative analysis of the data allowed us to identify three types of respondents. They were grouped according to their opinions and attitudes about the implementation of this standard. The three groups were ceremonial integrators, quality enthusiasts and dissidents. Although the \u201cquality enthusiasts\u201d discourse often reflects managers' \u201crhetoric of success\u201d described by Zbaracki (1998) about the implementation of total quality programs, this rhetoric is not shared by the other respondent categories. Hence, this research project contributes to a better understanding of how institutional pressures, which create \u201cisomorphic\u201d organizations by leading them to adopt identical management models, are reinterpreted, renegotiated, and modified within organizations. The proposed typology casts doubt on the mechanistic, consensual, and monolithic view of the ISO 9000 system that underlies most of the work on this theme. In particular, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting both the institutionalist and critical approaches in efforts to explain the respondents' opinions. In so doing, the personnel's support for the ISO 9000 system and the certification process can then be analyzed from different angles. This certification process would ultimately appear to be a rite of passage that gives rise to various strategies that depend on the respondents' category and their support for the standard.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.14.6.720.24873","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['critical', 'perception', 'resistance', 'institutional pressures', 'support']","The article discusses critical perspectives on the ISO 9000 standards and explores how employees perceive and resist these institutional pressures, indicating a focus on ethical organizational practices and employee experiences.

Expressive ties were associated with greater similarity in coworkers' perceptions than instrumental ties in the most affect-inducing justice perceptions, perceptions of interactional justice.

Theoretical studies have shown that exposure to POS data can lead to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers have no prior knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing POS data in stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We find, using a controlled simulation experiment, that sharing POS information does help reduce some components of the bullwhip effect in a stable demand setting, namely the order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one possible explanation for this improvement by examining the relationship between order decisions and demand line information.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2003.tb00194.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and the bullwhip effect without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Pooling can be accomplished through the reduction of the number of products or stock\u2010keeping units (SKUs), through postponement of differentiation, or in other ways. These approaches are well known and becoming widely applied in practice. However, theoretical analyses of the pooling effect assume an optimal inventory policy before pooling and after pooling, and, in most cases, that demand is normally distributed. In this article, we address the effect of nonoptimal inventory policies and the effect of nonnormally distributed demand on the value of pooling. First, we show that there is always a range of current inventory levels within which pooling is better and beyond which optimizing inventory policy is better. We also find that the value of pooling may be negative when the inventory policy in use is suboptimal. Second, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulation to examine the value of pooling for nonnormal demand distributions. We find that the value of pooling varies relatively little across the distributions we used, but that it varies considerably with the concentration of uncertainty. We also find that the ranges within which pooling is preferred over optimizing inventory policy generally are quite wide but vary considerably across distributions. Together, this indicates that the value of pooling under an optimal inventory policy is robust across distributions, but that its sensitivity to suboptimal policies is not. Third, we use a set of real (and highly erratic) demand data to analyze the benefits of pooling under optimal and suboptimal policies and nonnormal demand with a high number of SKUs. With our specific but highly nonnormal demand data, we find that pooling is beneficial and robust to suboptimal policies. Altogether, this study provides deeper theoretical, numerical, and empirical understanding of the value of pooling.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2003.tb00195.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and the pooling effect, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

The standard and widely used staffing method, which we call the stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach, divides the workday into planning periods and uses a series of stationary independent Erlang\u2010c queuing models\u2014one for each planning period\u2014to estimate minimum staffing needs. Our research evaluates and improves upon this commonly used heuristic for those telephone call centers with limited hours of operation during the workday. We show that the SIPP approach often suggests staffing that is substantially too low to achieve the targeted customer service levels (probability of customer delay) during critical periods. The major reasons for SIPP\u2018 s shortfall are as follows: (1) SIPP's failure to account for the time lag between the peak in customer demand and when system congestion actually peaks; and (2) SIPP\u2019 s use of the planning period average arrival rate, thereby assuming that the arrival rate is constant during the period. We identify specific domains for which SIPP tends to suggest inadequate staffing. Based on an analysis of the factors that influence the magnitude of the lag in infinite server systems that start empty and idle, we propose and test two simple \u201clagged\u201d SIPP modifications that, in most situations, consistently achieve the service target with only modest increases in staffing.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2003.tb00197.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical improvements to staffing methods in call centers without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this article, we present one such formulation that is a market utility\u2010based model for planning and scheduling in mass services (MUMS). MUMS is a holistic approach to market\u2010based service capacity scheduling. The MUMS framework provides the structure for modeling the consequences of aligning competitive priorities and service attributes with an element of the firm's service infrastructure. We developed a new linear programming formulation for the shift\u2010scheduling problem that uses market share information generated by customer preferences for service attributes. The shift\u2010scheduling formulation within the framework of MUMS provides a business\u2010level model that predicts the economic impact of the employee schedule. We illustrated the shift\u2010scheduling model with empirical data, and then compared its results with models using service standard and productivity standard approaches. The result of the empirical analysis provides further justification for the development of the market\u2010based approach.

We conclude that the objective functions used in the literature are appropriate only in the case of a central planner facing a demand that is unresponsive to waiting time. For other scenarios, such as a private server facing a demand that does react to waiting time, these objective functions are only shortcuts for the real objective functions that must be used. A more general model is then proposed that fits these scenarios well.

We study two main configurations, under the assumption that the disassembly sequence is exactly the reverse of the assembly sequence. Under a parallel configuration, there exist two separate dedicated lines, one for assembly and one for disassembly, which are decoupled by buffers\u2014from both disassembly operations, which have preference, as well as parts from an outside, perfectly reliable supplier. Under a mixed configuration, the same station is used for both disassembly and assembly of a specific part. The problem is studied using GI/G/c networks, as well as simulation. Due to a loss of pooling, we conclude that the parallel configuration outperforms the mixed line only when the variability of both arrivals and processing time are significantly higher for disassembly and remanufacturing than for assembly. Via a simulation, we explore the impact of having advanced yield information for the remanufacturing parts.

Scheduling such a machine is interesting when the changeover times from one product to another are non\u2010trivial\u2014which is generally the case. This problem has a substantial literature, but the common practices of \u201clot\u2010splitting\u201d and \u201cmaximization of utilization\u201d suggest that many practitioners still do not fully understand the principles of cyclic inventory. This paper is a tutorial that demonstrates those principles. We show that cyclic inventory is directly proportional to cycle length, which in turn is directly proportional to total changeover time, and inversely proportional to machine utilization. We demonstrate the virtue of \u201cmaximum changeover policies\u201d in minimizing cyclic inventory\u2014and the difficulty in making the transition to an increased level of demand. In so doing, we explicate the different roles of cyclic inventory, transitional inventory, and safety stock. We demonstrate the interdependence of the products in the cycle\u2014the lot\u2010size for one product cannot be set independently of the remaining products. We also give necessary conditions for consideration of improper schedules (i.e., where a product can appear more than once in the cycle), and demonstrate that both lot\u2010splitting and maximization of utilization are devastatingly counter\u2010productive when changeover time is non\u2010trivial.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2003.tb00215.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of cyclic inventory management without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our results support the commitment hypothesis. Insiders of firms that are associated with greater potential for moral hazard lockup their shares for a longer period of time. Insiders of firms that have experienced larger excess returns, are backed by venture capitalists, or go public with high-quality underwriters are more likely to be released from the lockup restrictions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/1/1/1614196","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO lockups and their implications for firm quality and moral hazard, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2003","16","1","Gurdip Bakshi\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Gurdip Bakshi\n            \u2004\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004University of Maryland\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Address correspondence to Gurdip Bakshi, Department of Finance, Robert H.

First, we document the differential pricing of individual equity options versus the market index and relate it to variations in return skewness. Second, we show how risk aversion introduces skewness in the risk-neutral density. Third, we derive laws that decompose individual return skewness into a systematic component and an idiosyncratic component. Empirical analysis of OEX options and 30 stocks demonstrates that individual risk-neutral distributions differ from that of the market index by being far less negatively skewed. This article explains the presence and evolution of risk-neutral skewness over time and in the cross section of individual stocks.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/1/101/1615098","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the economic sources of skewness in equity options, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2003","16","1","Philip H.

Although the compound option feature may seem complicated, there is a distribution-free dominant policy of exercising reload options whenever they are in the money. The optimal policy implies general formulas for numerical valuation. Simpler formulas for valuation and hedging follow from Black\u2013Scholes assumptions with or without continuous dividends. Time vesting affects the optimal policy, but numerical results indicate that it is nearly optimal to exercise in the money whenever feasible.

Coordination makes all specialists and customers better off, but requires a system of monitoring and punishment that breaks down when information asymmetries between the exchange and a specialist are high. The specialist may then seek a temporary trading halt to alleviate unjustified punishment, or the exchange may halt trading to prevent the quoting of damaging privately optimal pricing schedules. We test this theory on a sample of NYSE halts. As predicted, we find a significant increase in estimated information asymmetry immediately preceding trading halts.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/1/263/1617519","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading halts and information asymmetry without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2003","16","1","Fran\u00e7ois Derrien\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Fran\u00e7ois Derrien\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Kent L.

Bookbuilding is becoming increasingly popular outside the United States and typically costs twice as much as a fixed-price offer. However, on its own, bookbuilding only leads to lower underpricing when conducted by U.S. banks and/or targeted at U.S. investors. For most issuers, the gains associated with lower underpricing outweighed the additional costs associated with hiring U.S. banks or marketing in the United States. This suggests a quality/price trade-off contrasting with the findings of Chen and Ritter, particularly since non-U.S. issuers raising US$20 million\u2013US$80 million also typically pay a 7% spread when U.S. banks and investors are involved.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/1/63/1614725","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of equity markets and the financial implications of U.S. underwriting methods without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A PLM can always be supported in equilibrium as the dominant market (i.e., where the hybrid limit book is empty), but an HM can also be supported, for some market parameterizations, as the dominant market. We also show the possible coexistence of competing markets.

We model how intensively dealers monitor public information to avoid being picked off by professional day traders when monitoring is costly. Price competition among dealers is hampered by their incentives to share monitoring costs. The risk of being picked off by the day traders makes dealers more competitive. The interaction between these effects determines whether a firm quote rule improves trading costs and price discovery. Our empirical results support the prediction that professional day traders prefer stocks with small spreads, but offer less support for the prediction that their trading leads to wider spreads.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/2/345/1580732","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market making and information monitoring without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

I find size, book-to-market, and momentum strategies exhibit a strong, weak, and negligible relation to covariance risk, respectively. A size factor helps predict future volatility and covariation, improving the efficiency of investment strategies. Moreover, its premium rises following increases in both its volatility and covariation with other assets. These effects are amplified in recessions. No such relations exist for book-to-market or momentum. These findings may shed light on explanations for these premia and present a challenging set of facts for future theory.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/2/417/1581117","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and covariance risk without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In unconditional tests, approximately half of the strategies' profitability is explained. In conditional tests we see a further slight decline in profits. We argue that the risk of these strategies should be increasing in the market risk premium. Empirically, while their risk measures estimated relative to the stochastic discount factor behave as predicted, market betas do not; thus capital asset pricing model (CAPM)-like benchmarks may lead to incorrect inferences. Given that our nonparametric risk adjustment explains roughly half of momentum strategy profits, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual mispricing.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/2/459/1579691","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading strategies and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a sample of S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is less for options away from the money. Third, the underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility. Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects delta-hedged gains, even after accounting for jump fears.

We use a stopping time approach to solve the finite horizonconstrained consumption portfolio problem with constant relative risk aversion and to examine the structure of equilibrium. The impact of the constraint on the optimal consumption and the financing portfolio is assessed.

Our primary focus is on the interplay between the theoretical specification of dynamic term structure models and their empirical fit to historical changes in the shapes of yield curves. We begin by overviewing the dynamic term structure models that have been fit to treasury or swap yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions, jump-diffusion, or have \u201cswitching regimes.\u201d Then the goodness-of-fit of these models is assessed relative to their abilities to (i) match linear projections of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield curve; (ii) match the persistence of conditional volatilities, and the shapes of term structures of unconditional volatilities, of yields; and (iii) to reliably price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income derivatives.

The central focus is the relationship between bond prices and the short-term rate volatility. In both scalar and multidimensional diffusion settings, typical relationships between bond prices and volatility are generated by joint restrictions on the risk-neutralized drift functions of the state variables and convexity of bond prices with respect to the short-term rate. The theory is illustrated by several examples and is partially extended to accommodate the occurrence of jumps and default.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/3/679/1572635","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of bond pricing and interest rate models without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We characterize the extent of contagion, its economic significance, and its determinants using a multinomial logistic regression model. Applying our approach to daily returns of emerging markets during the 1990s, we find that contagion is predictable and depends on regional interest rates, exchange rate changes, and conditional stock return volatility.

This belief and the use of \u201cflat\u201d priors contribute strongly to the finding of nonlinear mean reversion. Implementation of an approximate Jeffreys prior results in virtually no evidence for mean reversion in interest rates unless stationarity is assumed.

This new test fails to reject the CAPM on a dataset of stocks sorted by market valuations, whereas similar tests constructed from OLS and GMM estimation methods reject the linear CAPM.

In a finite-horizon economy, a SAO is a zero-cost trading strategy for which (i) the expected payoff is positive, and (ii) the conditional expected payoff in each final state of the economy is nonnegative. Unlike a pure arbitrage opportunity, a SAO can have negative payoffs provided that the average payoff in each final state is nonnegative. If the pricing kernel in the economy is path independent, then no SAOs can exist. Furthermore, ruling out SAOs imposes a novel martingale-type restriction on the dynamics of securities prices. The important properties of the restriction are that it (1) is model-free, in the sense that it requires no parametric assumptions about the true equilibrium model, (2) can be tested in samples affected by selection biases, such as the peso problem, and (3) continues to hold when investors' beliefs are mistaken. The article argues that one can use the new restriction to empirically resolve the joint hypothesis problem present in the traditional tests of the efficient market hypothesis.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/3/875/1575103","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical arbitrage and securities pricing without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

While better technology may result in improved information processing, it might also lead to low-cost or even free access to information through, for example, informational spillovers. In the context of credit screening, we show that better access to information decreases interest rates and the returns from screening. However, an improved ability to process information increases interest rates and bank profits. Hence predictions regarding financial claims' pricing hinge on the overall effect ascribed to technological progress. Our results generalize to other financial markets where informational asymmetries drive profitability, such as insurance and securities markets.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/3/921/1575364","article","RFS","Finance","2","['information processing', 'access to information', 'credit screening']","The article primarily focuses on technological advancements and their impact on financial services competition, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Offer prices in Japan, unlike the United States, are announced several days before the beginning of the subscription period and incorporate a substantial discount. We suggest that the positive announcement effects in Japan are consistent with the underwriter's certification of the issuing firm's value. We characterize the underwriter's risk as a put option and find a positive association between the underwriter's risk and the announcement returns, as well as other results consistent with underwriter certification.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/3/949/1575520","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically underwriter certification and stock price responses, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2003","16","3","Sergei Sarkissian\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Sergei Sarkissian\n            \u2004\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004McGill University\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Address correspondence to Sergei Sarkissian, Faculty of Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St. W, Montreal H3A1G5, Canada, or e-mail: sergei.sarkissian@mcgill.ca.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        This article is based in part on the author's dissertation at the University of Washington.

These issues are addressed within the framework of the Constantinides and Duffie (1996) model applied to a multicountry world. The article shows that the cross-country variance of consumption growth rates is counter-cyclical and that this feature of consumption data is mildly helpful for currency pricing. In particular, unlike the standard CCAPM, the new model is able to generate currency risk premiums at lower values of risk aversion and provide certain explanatory power for cross-sectional differences in currency returns.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/3/983/1575730","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on risk sharing and currency risk premiums, without any mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

A high volume of liquidity trade facilitates price discovery. Thus prices are more efficient and more information is revealed per hour during the trading day than after hours. However, the low trading volume after hours generates significant, albeit inefficient, price discovery. Individual trades contain more information after hours than during the day. Because information asymmetry declines over the day, price changes are larger, reflect more private information, and are less noisy before the open than after the close.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/4/1041/1576361","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and price discovery without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

I test whether real flexibility increases debt capacity by lowering default risk and making assets more marketable or decreases debt capacity by facilitating risk shifting and asset substitution. I measure real flexibility as the sensitivity of marginal production and investment decisions to variations in the economic environment. I find that financial leverage is negatively related to production flexibility but positively related to investment flexibility. This split in results suggests that although asset substitution facilitated by investment flexibility can be prevented contractually, risk shifting facilitated by production flexibility is intractable.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/4/1131/1575356","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Subsidies to small financially constrained segments with good relative investment opportunities significantly increase excess value, while transfers of resources from segments with good relative investment opportunities significantly decrease excess value. Of interest is that subsidies to small financially constrained segments with poor relative investment opportunities also significantly increase excess value. However, there is little evidence that this result depends on the diversity of a firm's investment opportunities. We conclude that financing constraints drive the relationship between the internal capital market and firm value.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/16/4/1167/1575670","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial mechanisms and firm value without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Evidence also suggests that recent growth in institutional investment combined with this shift in preferences helps explain why markets in general, and smaller stocks in particular, have exhibited greater firm-specific risk and liquidity in recent years.

The institution can reduce its liquidity costs by holding debt rather than equity. Conversely, except in a limited setting resembling venture capital, firms that depend on monitored finance prefer to give the monitoring institution debt rather than equity.

Our tests control for past financing choices and the costs of adjusting capital structure, factors that can obscure cross-sectional patterns among firms' target leverage ratios. We find that firms that emerge from spin-offs with more financial leverage have a higher cash flow return on assets, lower variability of industry operating income, and a greater proportion of fixed assets. The positive relation between profitability and the use of financial leverage, in a setting that is free of pecking order effects, is particularly important because it contrasts with existing evidence. Our results indicate that the ability to cover debt payments and default-related costs are important determinants of the use of financial leverage, as implied by the trade-off theory of capital structure.

A new look at the evidence","In this study we revisit the question of whether firms' performance is driven primarily by industry or firm factors, extending past studies in two major ways. Firstly, in a departure from past research, we use value-based measures of performance (economic profit or residual income and market-to-book value) instead of accounting ratios (such as return on assets). We also use a new data set and a different statistical approach for testing the significance of the independent effects. Secondly, we examine whether the findings of past research can be generalized across all firms in an industry or whether they apply to a particular class of firms within the same industry. We find that a significant proportion of the absolute estimates of the variance of firm factors is due to the presence of a few exceptional firms in any given industry. In other words, only for a few dominant value creators (leaders) and destroyers (losers) do firm-specific assets seem to matter significantly more than industry factors. For most other firms, i.e., for those that are not notable leaders or losers in their industry, however, the industry effect turns out to be more important for performance than firm-specific factors.

What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a \u2018wake-up call\u2019 and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions.

This paper investigates winning as the dependent variable, as measured by distributions of annual industry leadership in profits and returns to investors. This shift in dependent variable introduces alternative null models of competitive parity, including skew distributions derived from the natural sciences, and empirical distributions from nonbusiness domains such as chess, politics, sports, and beauty pageants. An empirical study of 20-year leadership in U.S. industries shows that performance distributions in business follow statistical power laws resembling those in natural phenomena, and closely resemble distributions found in sports, politics, and other nonbusiness domains. The results support a presumption of persistent performance advantages in business, but show that business outcomes are indistinguishable from outcomes in the wider scientific and competitive landscape, and are amenable to explanation using relatively simple heuristics. The paper shows how the choice of null model shapes firm performance explanations, and explores the consequences of a more inclusive approach to null models in strategy research.

While the impact of each of these factors on resource-investment decisions has been considered in isolation, their joint interaction effect has never been examined. The model generates the following set of testable hypotheses: Managers of firms with agency problems will, on average, tend to under-invest (relative to what shareholders would ideally like them to do) in resources of uncertain value. This under-investment will be most severe for those resources where managers' information indicates a low expected value (i.e., risky bets), and will actually be reversed (i.e., over-investment) for those resources where managers' information indicates a high expected value (i.e., safe bets). Two levers can be used to reduce the degree of this under-investment: reducing the severity of the agency problems, or improving the accuracy of managers' expectations. Based on their interaction effect, these two levers are shown to be complementary in the sense that they work better together at reducing under-investment than either one does in isolation. Therefore, future research on the genesis of competitive advantage should examine agency and governance issues along with, not apart from, resource-based issues.

Some work suggests that socially constructed shared beliefs, not technology-based economic factors, determine industry structure. While research on managerial cognition is important because it helps strategy researchers incorporate bounded rationality into otherwise hyper-rational theories, we take issue with the notion that the social construction works independently of economic factors. Empirical studies looking for shared beliefs find conflicting results. Some work suggests that managers in an industry share a common set of beliefs; other work finds the opposite (managers do not share common beliefs). Understanding, if and to what extent, managerial cognition influences industry structure and competitive heterogeneity would greatly expand our understanding of strategy and firm performance. We model bounded rationality, cognition (belief formation), competition (economic restraints), and industry structure (competitive heterogeneity). We find that competitive pressure and bounded rationality induce agents (firms or managers) to focus their attention on nearby competitors. Thus, firms develop biased estimates of their competitive environment. These estimates correlate with the estimates of nearby firms. Thus, clusters of firms will have similar beliefs resulting in stable strategic and performance heterogeneity within an industry. However, as competitive pressures and the costs of strategic change decrease, managerial beliefs tend to converge, and the pattern of strategies that emerges is consistent with those predicted by economic theory, even under conditions of bounded rationality.

Most notably, we show that resource substitution conditions not only the sustainability of a competitive advantage, but the attainment of competitive advantage as well. With equifinality among resources of different types, the rareness condition for even temporary competitive advantage must include resource substitutes. It is not rareness in terms of resource type that matters, but rareness in terms of resource functionality.

Exclusion of the time-varying dimension of the corporate effect makes it difficult to fully understand the effect of corporate strategy and the actions of corporate managers, particularly in response to a changing environment. The evidence in this article shows that within a single industry, where managers face the same external environment, time-varying corporate effects associated with corporate level managerial decisions are statistically significant.

Building upon the literature in economics on coordination failures and incomplete markets, we suggest a framework for analyzing such strategic factor market inefficiencies. Our point of departure is that a strategic opportunity exists whenever prices fail to reflect the value of a resource's best use. This paper examines the challenges of imputing a resource's value in the absence of explicit price guidance and suggests the likely characteristics of strategic opportunities. Our framework also suggests that the discovery of strategic opportunity is often a matter of \u2018serendipity\u2019 and access to relevant idiosyncratic resources. This latter observation provides prescriptive advice, although the analysis also explains why more detailed guidance has to be firm specific.

Business management and strategy concerns the creation, evaluation, manipulation, administration, and deployment of unpriced specialized scarce resource combinations. This paper applies the formalism of cooperative game theory to these concerns. In cooperative game theory, rents appear as the negotiated payments for the services of scarce valuable resources. The division of surplus is determined by the relative values created by different use combinations of resources. Within this framework, the strategy problem is clearly seen as one of discovering or estimating the value of various resource combinations. New wealth can be created by trade in resources as long as there are hitherto unexamined combinations.

We used a two-study design to evaluate quantitative data analysis trends and doctoral training. An analysis of Strategic Management Journal articles from 1980 to 2001 reveals that, contrary to some predictions, the use of general linear model techniques such as regression has increased over time. However, the use of more specialized techniques, including those suitable for examining longitudinal data, discrete events, and causal structure, has also grown substantially. A survey of recent doctoral graduates shows that, although skilled with general linear models, many are ill prepared to use specialized techniques.

I consider arguments suggested by both the contractual and the competence perspectives. In order to distinguish empirically between them, I devote special attention to the role played by the similarity of partner firms' technological specialization. In the empirical section I consider a sample composed of 271 equity joint ventures, non-equity bilateral and unilateral agreements established between each other in the period 1983\u201386 by 67 North American, European, and Japanese enterprises from the world's largest firms in information technology industries. I examine the effects on the choice of alliance form of a measure of firms' technological proximity based on patents count, while controlling for other variables that are usually considered in the empirical literature. The estimates of binomial and multinomial logit models support the competence-based argument that in technological alliances divergence in partners' technological specialization results in a higher propensity to use equity forms. Overall, the findings suggest that both the contractual and competence perspectives provide valuable complementary insights into the determinants of alliance form.

This paper explores other factors that may influence firm performance over the longer term after a radical change\u2014specifically, those related to product line management strategy. Following a radical change, a period of incremental technological change typically creates the opportunity for rapid development of new products. In such settings, strategies to manage multiple products, including families of related products that can be derived from a common platform, may be expected to impact competitive performance, especially over the longer term. The data for the study are from the telecommunications switching sector, specifically the private branch exchange (PBX) industry. Fifty-six firms and over 240 new products were analyzed over 22 years. This study shows that incumbent\u2013entrant-based explanations of firm performance are incomplete. In particular, the results demonstrate that product line strategy explains significant additional variation in firm performance. The paper tests hypotheses linking both overall product line strategy and product platform strategy to firm performance. It finds that overall product introduction rates and product longevity can be linked to performance. It also shows that decomposing overall strategy into product platform strategy\u2014rates of platform and derivative introduction, and platform longevity\u2014can further increase explanatory power. In total, the results indicate that strategic prescriptions in the literature that emphasize development speed alone are oversimplified. They also suggest that differences in how relationships among products derived from a common platform are managed can contribute to competitive advantage and demand complex trade-offs.

Corroborating a view that social capital holds contingent value, we theorize that executives facing different industrial conditions have different levels of commitment to exploiting interpersonal ties for fulfilling organizational needs. We propose that managerial networking is influenced by exogenous industrial attributes such as structural uncertainty, sales growth, regulatory stringency, competitive pressure, and production capacity utilization. Our analysis of executives in 364 firms in China demonstrates that the level of managerial networking increases when uncertainty, regulation, and competition increase and production capacity utilization decreases. For a specific firm, the link between industrial dynamics and managerial networking is moderated by its strategic proactiveness.

The use of cointegration analysis overcomes some of the limitations associated with prior attempts at modeling firm behavior within groups, and allows us to model strategies that take considerable time to adjust. Results indicate that several strategies displayed slow adjustment characteristics. All of the strategies that displayed these properties were cointegrated within the group. Finally, over the long run, the rate of strategic response to \u2018shocks\u2019 in the system varied across members and strategies: some converged, while others diverged from the group relationship.

We compare the signaling value to young firms of having ties with two types of interorganizational partnerships: endorsement relationships such as those with venture capital firms and investment banks, and strategic alliance partnerships. We propose that, under different equity market conditions, potential investors in an issuing firm attend to different types of uncertainty; attention to these different types of uncertainty affects investors' perceptions of the relative value of a young firm's different kinds of endorsements and partnerships and, hence, IPO success. Results from a sample of young biotechnology firms show that ties to prominent venture capital firms are particularly beneficial to IPO success during cold markets, while ties to prominent investment banks are particularly beneficial to IPO success during hot markets; a firm's strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical/health care firms did not have such contingent effects. Implications for understanding the contingent value of interorganizational ties are discussed.

A formal model is presented in which dynamic capabilities are treated as a set of routines guiding the evolution of a firm's resource configuration. The model centers on the endogenous choice firms make between resource deployment through imitation and experimentation in order to generate alternative resource configurations. Three performance-relevant attributes of dynamic capabilities are proposed: timing, cost, and learning of resource deployment. Theoretical propositions are developed that suggest how these attributes contribute to the emergence of differential intraindustry firm performance. Simulation analysis offers insights into the trajectories of evolutionary change engendered by dynamic capability, and serves to refine the theoretical propositions. It is found that timing, cost, and learning effects foster the emergence of robust performance differences among firms with strikingly similar dynamic capabilities. Moreover, the results show that even small initial differences among firms can generate significant intraindustry differential firm performance, especially when the effects of timing, cost and learning are combined.

Their positioning in strategic groups, in turn, is argued to influence firm actions and firm performance. We extend this research to examine performance implications of competitive positioning not just among but also within groups. We find that performance differences within groups are significantly larger than across groups, suggesting that some firms within groups develop better resource or competitive positions. We also find that secondary firms within a group outperform both core firms within the group and solitary firms, the latter being those not belonging to any multifirm strategic group. This suggests that secondary firms may be able to effectively balance the benefits of strategic distinctiveness with institutional pressures for similarity. We conclude that the primary implication of strategic groups does not relate to the ability of firms to create stable, advantageous market segments through collusion. Instead, strategic groups represent a range of viable strategic positions firms may stake out and use as reference points. Moreover, our results concerning secondary firms indicate that firm positioning within a group structure can have performance implications.

Entry mode has a major impact on R&D activities: the R&D intensities of acquired affiliates substantially exceed those in wholly owned greenfield affiliates, while the R&D intensities of minority owned ventures are higher if Japanese parent firms lack strong R&D capabilities at home. For greenfield operations, support is found for an incremental growth pattern of foreign R&D as a function of organizational learning and affiliate capability building. The results are consistent with the view that part of the explanation for Japanese firms' relative lack of involvement in overseas R&D must be sought in their status as \u2018latecomers\u2019 in the establishment of overseas manufacturing networks. At the same time, a number of Japanese firms have actively used foreign acquisitions and joint ventures to gain access to overseas technology and to establish overseas R&D capabilities at a faster pace.

We find little support for the argument that markets have become more hypercompetitive. From the late 1970s to the late-1980s we observe decreased performance and market stability, consistent with increasing hypercompetition contentions.

For practice, our results suggest that managers today face markets no more dynamic and opportunities to gain and sustain competitive advantage no more challenging than in the past.

We suggest that network effects are a function of network size (i.e., installed customer base) and network strength (i.e., the marginal impact of a unit increase in network size on demand). We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting noncooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega). Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for this situation in which the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) was able to overtake the sales of a firm with a larger network size (Sega).

Partially in response, the supply of ethical decision-making models has grown rapidly. Business ethics scholars have broadened their scope to incorporate moral philosophies into their research endeavors. Despite these positive trends, the international focus of business ethics research has been slow to evolve. Yet, diverse moral philosophies, often most apparent across international borders, have important strategic implications for multinational firms. The ethical norms pursued by cross-cultural alliance partners, distributors, suppliers, customers, financiers, and foreign government agencies can create public relations disasters, foster shareholder unrest, lead to consumer boycotts, and impact organizational outcomes. We seek to rectify the deficiency in international business ethics scholarship with two distinct contributions. First, we develop a new cross-cultural, macro-level model of societal ethics. Second, we map moral philosophies onto an established framework for assessing socioeconomic environments. These theoretical tools should assist managers of multinational organizations, international policy-makers, and researchers to recognize and prepare for the ethical consequences of international strategic decisions.

It has been recognized in the literature that, under normal stable circumstances, a firm's internal resources and its external market power are fundamentally intertwined. Consequently, it is difficult to identify the relative roles of these two theories in explaining expected firm performance and firm value. However, when market conditions are in a state of flux, as in the case of the Czech Republic in 1992, we expect the firm's resources to be the primary determinants of firm value. In order to test this notion, an RBV model was developed, based on a set of firm features reflecting the rare and valuable ability to compete in the emerging capitalistic economy (as opposed to the currently prevailing bureaucratically planned economy). A contrasting MBV model was also developed, highlighting the role of market power in this regard. These models were assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 988 Czech firms undergoing privatization. The empirical findings show that the RBV-driven variables are remarkably better at explaining share values of Czech firms in the period of privatization than MBV-driven variables. These results underscore the role of firm resources as a primary determinant of firm value in rapidly changing environments.

Given the substantial evidence of organizational learning, firms may be expected to improve their timing skills of capacity additions through their previous capacity expansion experience. Hypotheses are developed both for proprietary learning and learning at the industry level, and for forgetting. These hypotheses are tested on a database consisting of 72 companies operating in the petrochemicals industry in the United States, Europe, and Japan from 1975 to 1995. The results indicate that learning in timing capacity expansion decisions comes primarily from within firms through an accumulation of their poor outcomes.

Despite the presumption that environmental turbulence renders conventional strategic planning all but impossible, the evidence from the corporate sector suggests that reports of the demise of strategic planning are greatly exaggerated. The goal of this paper is to fill this empirical gap by describing the characteristics of the strategic planning systems of multinational, multibusiness companies faced with volatile, unpredictable business environments. In-depth case studies of the planning systems of eight of the world's largest oil companies identified fundamental changes in the nature and role of strategic planning since the end of the 1970s. The findings point to a possible reconciliation of \u2018design\u2019 and \u2018process\u2019 approaches to strategy formulation. The study pointed to a process of planned emergence in which strategic planning systems provided a mechanism for coordinating decentralized strategy formulation within a structure of demanding performance targets and clear corporate guidelines. The study shows that these planning systems fostered adaptation and responsiveness, but showed limited innovation and analytical sophistication.

We suggest that theoretical arguments about size be examined carefully to specify models with explicit comparison sets and with mechanisms linking size and underlying processes to outcomes. We illustrate the approach here by advancing arguments about scale competition within an organizational population. In this effort, we feature a theoretical model of scale-based selection, which posits that a firm's chances of survival decrease with its aggregate distance from larger competitors on a transformed size gradient. The model assumes that the appropriate comparison set consists of all contemporaneous similar organizations competing on the basis of scale and operating in a localized geographic setting. We argue that aggregate distance of a focal firm from larger other firms (a specific form of relative position in the size distribution) reflects the extent to which it can capitalize on potential competitive advantages of scale emanating from economic, political, and social processes. Analyzing the mortality rates of large organizations across the entire histories of automobile industries in four major countries provides support for the theory.

To create value, firms develop and use resources and capabilities that other firms cannot imitate, trade for, or substitute other assets for. Even a firm that has created value, however, may not capture the potential rents associated with that value. To capture rents, a firm must set the right prices for what it sells. Most views of pricing assume that a firm can readily set appropriate prices. In contrast, we argue that pricing is a capability. To develop the ability to set the right prices, a firm must invest in resources and routines. We base our argument on a study of the pricing process of a large Midwestern manufacturing firm. We show that pricing resources, routines, and skills may help or inhibit a firm in setting the right price\u2014and hence in appropriating value created. Our view of pricing as a capability contributes to the resource-based view because it suggests that strategists should consider the portfolio of value creation and value appropriation capabilities a firm uses to create competitive advantage. Our view also contributes to economics because it suggests that strategic decisions about pricing capabilities have important implications for a fundamental economic action, determining prices. Managers in firms without effective pricing processes may be unable to set prices that reflect the wishes of its customers, so the customers may misuse their resources. As a result, resources may be used ineffectively. Our view of pricing as a capability therefore takes the resource-based-view straight to the heart of what is perhaps the central economic question: the best use of resources.

In such locations, ownership structure should be a key determinant of governance reform. Firms with dispersed ownership are likely to face agency problems but may lack sufficient ownership power in the hand of external owners for adoption to occur. Extensive ownership by external parties facilitates adoption but decreases the need and motivation to adopt governance reform. We examined the adoption of stock-based incentive plans and transparent accounting regulations (e.g., greater disclosure to shareholders) among large German firms (DAX 100) during the late 1990s. We found an inverse \u2018U\u2019-shaped relationship between ownership concentration and governance reform.

We argue that while social capital is essential for the acquisition, integration, and release of resources at the core of a dynamic capability, actors can also use social capital for personal gain. Thus, social capital may be a key to understanding both rent generation and rent appropriation. Even when causal ambiguity obscures individual contributions, they may use their social capital to establish credible claims on the rent. Specifically, employees who occupy structural holes, span organizational boundaries, or who are highly central may be most able to appropriate rent because their social capital grants credibility to their claims. Rent that is appropriated in this way may be unobservable in performance measures that fail to distinguish normal compensation from rent. We contribute by identifying the specific role of social capital in a dynamic capability and linking social capital to rent appropriation patterns.

Using survey and archival data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry during the period 1981\u201391, we find that different approaches to technology sourcing (internal R&D and external R&D) are related to different types of biotechnology-based output at the end of the period. Internal R&D was positively associated with patent output. Acquisition activity was positively related to number of biotechnology-based products. Greater use of R&D contracts and licenses was associated with stronger reputation for possessing expertise in biotechnology. These findings underscore the importance of taking a multifaceted approach to technology sourcing in order to build the absorptive capacity needed to generate new technical output. Surprisingly, we also found that involvement in joint ventures was negatively related to patent output. This raises interesting questions about the strategic use of joint ventures in a regime of encompassing technological change.

Thus even if we can find sources of durable profits, maybe we shouldn't\u2014because doing so comes at the expense of social welfare. In this sense, strategy is an \u2018economic bad.\u2019 Probably the most vivid evidence of this tension is the fact that Porter's Competitive Strategy (1982) is Industrial Organization turned on its head\u2014exploiting indications of anti-competitive behavior to create prescriptions for durable profits. This study presents a parallax view in which the field of strategy is an economic good. In this view, heterogeneity stimulates innovation and economic growth. The underlying logic is that heterogeneity fuels diffusion; diffusion erodes leaders' shares; the loss of shares stimulates innovation, which in turn fuels new diffusion. I develop this view through a simple model of firms embedded in an industry, and then evaluate the model via simulation. The key issue for the model is whether there are steady states that sustain heterogeneity and innovation. Results indicate that heterogeneity persists in roughly half the industry conditions I examined. Furthermore innovation and growth are sustained under those conditions. What is comforting about the set of conditions is that they accommodate (and indeed require) all the things we hold dear: industrial policy, and strategic as well as routine behavior by firms. The new insights are as follows: (1) heterogeneity fuels growth (thus \u2018strategy\u2019 is an economic good, rather than anathema to allocative efficiency); (2) persistent heterogeneity is feasible even in the presence of spillovers (without isolating mechanisms); (3) but this heterogeneity (while persistent) requires managers to actively preserve the inherent value of their resource advantages\u2014firms can't rest on their laurels; (4) policy prescriptions differ from those of prior innovation models.

We present a research protocol to identify a domain of organizational knowledge resources within industries. Using a sample of organizations from the hospital and textile industries, we interviewed CEOs to identify the feasible set of knowledge resources. We presented this set to managers at those organizations to measure their perceptions of the value-added of each knowledge resource for their organizations. The results demonstrate that the importance of knowledge resources varies by industry and organization, and calls to question efforts to generate an inventory of generic knowledge resources that is applicable across industries.

We argue that high-performing CEOs vary their relative scanning emphases on different domains according to the level of dynamism they perceive in their external environments. The concepts of dominant logic and sector importance were used to develop predictions about which external domains and which internal domains should receive relatively more or less scanning emphasis in external environments that, overall, are more dynamic or more stable. A field survey of 105 single-business manufacturing firms evaluated CEOs' scanning emphases and firm performance. Results indicated that, for dynamic external environments, relatively more CEO attention to the task sectors of the external environment and to innovation-related internal functions was associated with high performance. In stable external environments, however, simultaneously increased scanning of the general sectors in the external environment and efficiency-related internal functions produced higher performance. These relationships were strongest between relative scanning emphases among domains and sales growth. We discuss the implications of these results for researchers and practitioners.

The central thesis is that professional firms derive power from their specialized expertise and lead clients towards complex problems that apply the expertise. In particular, relative to cash-financed acquisitions, stock-financed acquisitions more intensively apply investment banks' expertise. Consistent with expectations, results from a sample of 404 acquisitions show that firms are more likely to hire banks on stock-financed acquisitions when they have previously used banks. Evidence also suggests that clients that hire banks on such acquisitions are prone to adverse performance from them. Overall, these results suggest that professional firms lead clients to complex solutions with problematic outcomes.

While such an emphasis is clearly important, it does little to shed light on potential relationships between governance and the strategies pursued by risky firms, nor does it take into account the complementary role of key stakeholders in affecting those strategies. To partially remedy this deficit we integrate agency and behavioral perspectives to develop a theory of \u2018reasoned risk-taking,\u2019 whereby the nature of risks undertaken is a consequence of the interaction of governance mechanisms and stakeholder characteristics. We demonstrate our theory by predicting when corporate governance should be associated with strategic risk-seeking beyond a firm's technical core\u2014as seen in the degree to which it has expanded internationally. Surprisingly, even though venture capitalists (VC) are risk specialists, we find that technology-based IPO firms are less likely (i.e., a negative relationship) to have extensive global sales when they are backed by a VC. In support of our reasoned risk-taking theoretical framework, we find that VCs are indeed risk-seeking when VC backing is complemented by the international experience of their board appointees, top management team (TMT) members, or both. IPO firms with significant insider ownership are similarly global risk-seekers, and those effects are strongest with an internationally seasoned board and TMT at the helm.

We propose and test a model accounting for interfirm differences in forecasting ability. After controlling for reciprocal effects, we find that two principal firm-level factors (i.e., organizational illusion of control and organizational attention) influence both bias and magnitude of errors in estimates. High organizational illusion of control increases positive forecast bias. As for organizational attention, higher relative investments in market information appear to reduce positive forecast bias and magnitude of errors; they also moderate forecast bias due to illusion of control. Finally, higher relative investments in employee capability increase both negative forecast bias and, unexpectedly, magnitude of errors for the majority of observed cases.

Starting with a sample of firms who have bank debt and who also voluntarily changed accounting methods, we investigate whether the likelihood that the change in accounting method increased (rather than decreased) the borrower's income depends on (1) whether the change in accounting method affects the bank debt contract calculations, (2) the expected costs of violating the bank debt covenants, (3) whether performance pricing provisions affect the interest rate on the loan, and (4) whether the bank debt contract contains accounting\u2010based dividend restrictions. After controlling for other motives for changing accounting methods, we find that borrowers whose bank debt contracts allow accounting method changes to affect contact calculations are more likely to make income\u2010increasing rather than income\u2010decreasing changes. This increase in likelihood of an income\u2010increasing change is attenuated when expected costs of technical violation are lower because there is a single lender, and occurs for borrowers whose debt contacts have performance pricing and dividend restrictions. These results suggest that incentives to lower interest rates through performance pricing or to retain dividend payment flexibility influence borrowers' accounting method choices, thereby addressing the fundamental questions posed by Fields et al.

We find that only some of the analyst characteristics that are associated with future forecast accuracy are also associated with return responses to forecast revisions.

In addition, forecast properties other than expected accuracy appear to be value\u2010relevant.

I rank by complexity six tax\u2010law changes enacted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and then examine analysts' explicit forecasts of effective tax rates around those changes. I show that analysts' revisions of their forecasts of effective tax rates appear to impound the effects of the less complex tax\u2010law changes but not the more complex changes. Furthermore, as expected, if analysts assimilate less complex (but not more complex) information, the magnitude of the errors in their forecasts of effective tax rates increases with the effects of the more complex tax\u2010law changes, but is unrelated to the less complex changes. Taken together, these results indicate that analysts assimilate less complex information to a greater extent than they assimilate more complex information. Either analysts' abilities to incorporate specific information into their forecasts is a decreasing function of the complexity of that information, or analysts choose not to assimilate complex information because the cost would exceed the benefit. In either case, complexity reduces analysts' use of information. These results demonstrate the importance of considering information attributes, such as complexity, when investigating why analysts' forecasts fail to incorporate all public information.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/1/275/2730/The-Effect-of-Information-Complexity-on-Analysts","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of financial analysis and information complexity without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Banks with significant deferred tax assets are less likely to convert, presumably because the write\u2010off of deferred taxes at conversion decreases regulatory capital and exposes the bank to costly regulatory intervention.

Just as we can disaggregate profitability into accruals and cash flows from operations, we can disaggregate growth in net operating assets into accruals and growth in long\u2010term net operating assets. We find that, after controlling for current profitability, both components of growth in net operating assets\u2014accruals and growth in long\u2010term net operating assets\u2014have equivalent negative associations with one\u2010year\u2010ahead return on assets.

Specifically, we develop two models to evaluate the movement between classes of compliant and noncompliant taxpayers. Our analysis suggests that the effect on compliance of changing enforcement levels depends on whether the taxpayer population is initially compliant or noncompliant. Compliant populations are insensitive to changes in enforcement policies until enforcement becomes sufficiently lax, when we observe a sudden shift to high levels of noncompliance in equilibrium. In contrast, relatively noncompliant populations respond to increased enforcement by gradually increasing compliance. Then, when enforcement becomes sufficiently harsh, we find a sudden shift in equilibrium to very high levels of compliance. After the taxpayer population shifts from compliance to noncompliance, or vice versa, our models predict that returning to the previous enforcement policy will not cause the population to return to its previous state. On the whole, our models' results help explain why taxpayer compliance varies across time and across geographic regions, even under similar enforcement regimes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/1/39/2707/Social-Behaviors-Enforcement-and-Tax-Compliance","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['social norms', 'compliance', 'enforcement']","The article discusses social norms and enforcement in the context of tax compliance, indicating some awareness of social behavior dynamics.

The manager has unique skills that are essential for implementing the project, and he can pursue the project inside the firm or as an outside venture on his own. The firm's owner thus faces a potential managerial retention problem, where the severity of the retention problem depends on the project's outside viability. My analysis shows that if the managerial retention problem is not too severe, the owner can delegate the investment decision to the manager and use a residua\u2010lincome\u2010based bonus contract to give the manager incentives to work hard and make appropriate investment decisions. If the retention problem is severe, however, then the owner must use an option\u2010based compensation contract to retain the manager and provide him with appropriate incentives. I also establish that as the managerial retention problem becomes more severe, the owner reduces the rate of return, or hurdle rate, required to approve the investment project. These results predict that new\u2010economy firms, in which managerial expertise is critical and yet mobile, are more likely to (1) include stock options in their managers' compensation contracts, and (2) apply lower hurdle rates for approving capital investments.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/1/71/2712/Capital-Budgeting-and-Managerial-Compensation","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial compensation and investment decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine auditor dismissals following new going\u2010concern reports that Big 6 firms issued between 1988 and 1999. Our findings suggest that audit committees with greater independence, greater governance expertise, and lower stockholdings are more effective in shielding auditors from dismissal after the issuance of new going\u2010concern reports. In addition, we find that the relation between audit committee independence and auditor protection from dismissal has grown stronger over time. Finally, independent audit committee members experience a significant increase in turnover rate after auditor dismissals. These findings, coupled with those from Carcello and Neal (2000), suggest that when affiliated directors dominate the audit committee, management often can (1) pressure its auditor to issue an unmodified report despite going\u2010concern issues, and (2) dismiss its auditor if the auditor refuses to issue an unmodified report.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/1/95/2717/Audit-Committee-Characteristics-and-Auditor","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['independence', 'governance', 'auditor', 'dismissal']","The article discusses governance and independence in audit committees, which touches on ethical considerations in financial reporting.

In this study, we examine whether the Vf/P effect is due to market mispricing or omitted risk factors. We find that the Vf/P effect is partially concentrated around the future earnings announcements, consistent with the mispricing explanation. On using an extensive set of risk proxies, suggested by Gebhardt et al. (2001) and Gode and Mohanram (2001), we also find that Vf/P is significantly related to some risk proxies. However, after controlling for these risk factors, Vf/P continues to exhibit a significant positive association with future returns suggesting that these risk factors are not responsible for the Vf/P effect.

In our partial disclosure equilibrium, managers voluntarily disclose if their firm has a low variance of future cash flows, but withhold the information if their firm has highly variable future cash flows. We establish how the manager's discretionary risk disclosure affects the firm's share price, expected stock returns, and beta, within the framework of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. We show that whereas one manager's discretionary disclosure of his firm's risk does not affect other firms' share prices, it does affect the other firms' betas. Also, we demonstrate that a disclosing firm has lower risk premium and beta ex post than a nondisclosing firm. Finally, we show that ex ante, the expected risk premium and expected beta of each firm are higher under a mandatory risk disclosure regime than in the partial disclosure equilibrium that arises under a voluntary disclosure regime.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/2/449/2699/Discretionary-Risk-Disclosures","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk disclosure in accounting without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize and find that annual earnings have a weaker association with current price changes and a stronger association with lagged price changes over time. We hypothesize and find that annual earnings reflect current positive price changes less strongly and current negative price changes more strongly over time. We also find that asymmetry with respect to lagged price changes is increasingly important over time. Strikingly, we find that, since the mid\u20101980s, the aggregation of earnings over a four\u2010year window increasingly does less to reduce the importance of lags and asymmetry.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/2/523/2706/Why-Has-the-Contemporaneous-Linear-Returns","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting earnings and their relation to stock returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We assess whether reviewers' detection of conclusion errors and documentation errors depends on three factors: nature of the preparer's stylization (by way of the preparer's differential emphasis on conclusion and documentation errors), auditor rank, and the reviewer's sensitivity to such stylization attempts. Our results show that, depending on the reviewers' stylization sensitivity, their cognitive templates can both facilitate and interfere with reviewers' effectiveness in responding to these stylization attempts, resulting in both potential gains and losses from the review process.

We find that the subjectivity in the scorecard plan allowed superiors to reduce the \u201cbalance\u201d in bonus awards by placing most of the weight on financial measures, to incorporate factors other than the scorecard measures in performance evaluations, to change evaluation criteria from quarter to quarter, to ignore measures that were predictive of future financial performance, and to weight measures that were not predictive of desired results. This evidence suggests that psychology\u2010based explanations may be equally or more relevant than economicsbased explanations in explaining the firm's measurement practices.

For example, when auditors have goals of accepting client\u2010preferred accounting methods, they tend to exploit ambiguity in reporting standards to justify those methods, even when they are aggressive (Hackenbrack and Nelson 1996). We report an experimental investigation of the likely effectiveness of regulation designed to curb this tendency. Specifically, regulators suggest that having auditors identify benchmarks or assess the quality of various methods will \u201craise the bar\u201d for method acceptability, thereby reducing auditor acceptance of aggressive reporting methods. However, this reasoning ignores the fact that ambiguity typically surrounds quality assessment. Following motivated reasoning theory, we argue that, in order to meet the increased standard for acceptability, auditors with high commitment to directional goals will exploit the ambiguity surrounding the quality of various methods when making quality assessments, with the result that the client\u2010preferred method will be deemed best, or at least of high enough relative quality to be used. This theory suggests that auditor acceptance will increase with goal commitment, and that the increase will be most dramatic when quality assessment is performed. Results of our experiment support our hypotheses that performing a quality assessment amplifies the effects of auditors' directional goals on their acceptance of client\u2010preferred methods and on their ratings of the quality of that method. Moreover, auditors making quality assessments are more likely to identify the client's method as the most appropriate method when they are more committed to their directional goals. An implication of our theory and results is that regulation (such as SAS No. 90) that requires auditors to make quality assessments may decrease auditors' objectivity when auditors have directional goals to accept client methods.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/3/759/2722/The-Effect-of-Quality-Assessment-and-Directional","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['regulation', 'objectivity', 'quality assessment']","The article discusses the implications of regulatory frameworks and the potential impact on auditor objectivity, which touches on ethical considerations in accounting practices.

We examine how materiality uncertainty affects the auditor's evaluation of audit evidence and a manager's choice of earnings overstatement in a strategic auditing model where earnings misstatements also include unintentional system error. We find that when the expected cost of accepting financial statements that are materially misstated, which we refer to as an audit failure, is relatively large, an increase in materiality uncertainty results in a more conservative auditor evaluation of the audit evidence and a decrease in the amount of intentional overstatement. Alternatively, if the auditor's expected cost of extending audit procedures is relatively high, then an increase in materiality uncertainty results in a less conservative auditor evaluation of the audit evidence and an increase in the manager's earnings overstatement. The auditor also becomes increasingly conservative as the report increases when the information system is sufficiently noisy. Finally, when the expected cost of audit failure is large, the equilibrium audit risk can increase or decrease in materiality uncertainty despite the corresponding increase in auditor conservatism and decrease in intentional overstatement. Audit risk is the average probability of audit failure across all possible evidence outcomes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/3/819/2715/Materiality-Uncertainty-and-Earnings-Misstatement","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of materiality and audit processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques related to business practices.

However, the systems differ on whether team members report observations of their peers' efforts to management (vertical incentive system) or directly control the actions of each other (horizontal incentive system). Findings suggest that the effectiveness of these systems depends on the level of team identity. Specifically, a strong team identity leads to greater coordination. The result is that the effectiveness of a vertical incentive system is degraded by a strong team identity. On the other hand, a horizontal incentive system becomes more effective in the presence of a strong team identity. The results of this study suggest that when the team has achieved a high level of identity, the most effective way to use this information is likely horizontal in nature, delegating responsibility for control to self\u2010managed teams, rather than extracting the information through reporting mechanisms.

Consistent with prior empirical research, we document that the relative weight on price and non\u2010price performance measures in CEO cash pay is a decreasing function of the relative variances. Agency theory speaks to the weights in total compensation (annual total pay and changes in the CEO's equity portfolio value), however, and we document that very little of CEOs' total incentives come from cash pay. We also document that variation in the relative weight on price and non\u2010price performance measures in CEO total compensation is an increasing function of the relative variances. The conflicting results using total compensation indicate that existing findings on cash pay cannot be interpreted as evidence supporting standard agency predictions. Based on our results, we suggest approaches for future research on performance measure use in CEO total compensation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/4/957/2738/Price-versus-Non-Price-Performance-Measures-in","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of CEO compensation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The five\u2010year interval between data collection periods allows us to measure changes in risk assessments and sample sizes between the two periods. Auditors relied on controls and assessed inherent risk below the maximum on most audits, and were more likely to do so in the later period, consistent with a trend of lower risk assessment levels. Average sample sizes declined between 1994 and 1999 for the firms that had larger sample sizes in the earlier period. Overall, we find a significant relationship between inherent risk assessments and sample sizes, but this relationship is stronger in the earlier period and is not significant for all firms, especially in the later period. We find limited evidence of a relationship between control risk and sample sizes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/78/4/983/2756/A-Longitudinal-Field-Investigation-of-Auditor-Risk","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditor risk assessments and sample size decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."]]}
