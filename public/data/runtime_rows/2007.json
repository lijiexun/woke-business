The methodology of academic research and scholarly publishing operate in an entirely different time frame than actual management, a difficulty that may be impossible to fully overcome.

On the level of national culture, we propose that the typical collectivistic culture of China will dampen the effects of structural holes. On the organizational level, we propose that in organizations that foster a high-commitment culture\u2014a culture that emphasizes mutual investment between people\u2014the control benefits of structural holes are dissonant with the dominant spirit of cooperation, and the information benefits of structural holes cannot materialize due to the communal-sharing values in such organizations. Empirical results of network surveys confirm our hypotheses, and interview data add depth to our explanations. Brokers do not fit with the collectivistic values of China. Further, the more an organization possesses a clan-like, high-commitment culture, the more detrimental are structural holes for employees' career achievements such as salary or bonus, even after controlling for a host of other factors that may influence these career outcomes.

Using behavioral theory, we argue that for family firms, the primary reference point is the loss of their socioemotional wealth, and to avoid those losses, family firms are willing to accept a significant risk to their performance; yet at the same time, they avoid risky business decisions that might aggravate that risk. Thus, we propose that the predictions of behavioral theory differ depending on family ownership. We confirm our hypotheses using a population of 1,237 family-owned olive oil mills in Southern Spain who faced the choice during a 54-year period of becoming a member of a cooperative, a decision associated with loss of family control but lower business risk, or remaining independent, which preserves the family's socioemotional wealth but greatly increases its performance hazard.

Rather than focusing solely on dependence advantage and the concomitant logic of power, we focus on joint dependence, which operates through a logic of embeddedness. We examine how the effect of joint dependence on performance is mediated by specific elements of embeddedness: joint action, trust, and the quality and scope of information exchange. Results show that joint dependence enhances the performance of procurement relationships for manufacturers and that this effect is partially mediated by the level of joint action and the quality of information exchange between the partners. Decomposing dependence asymmetry into the conditions of a manufacturer's and a supplier's dependence advantage, we also find that while the manufacturer's dependence advantage diminishes its performance, the supplier's dependence advantage has a null effect.

Our hypotheses challenge assumptions in the management literature that each group will necessarily express ingroup bias and outgroup derogation. Instead, we call attention to the status hierarchy that develops from status construction processes, the prototypicality that emerges from social categorization processes, and a framework of stereotype content that is based on an analysis of structural positions among groups in the society. Using hierarchical linear modeling with survey data from scientists and engineers in research and development in 24 major corporations, we find that U.S.-born white males, who constitute the normative ingroup, receive advantages in both allocation and evaluation decisions from all evaluators, not just from other white men. We also find that normative outgroups (non-male, non-whites, and/or non-U.S. born) receive ambivalent or indifferent more than discriminatory or biased treatment, depending on their structural position in relation to U.S.-born white men, and that these effects are independent of who is doing the rating.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.52.2.175","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['demographic groups', 'ingroup bias', 'outgroup derogation', 'status hierarchy', 'structural positions']","The article addresses issues of demographic disparities in the allocation and evaluation of work experiences, highlighting biases related to structural positions within the workforce.

We develop three claims: (1) crowding from below, which measures the number of competitors capable of surpassing a given actor in a tournament-based contest, predisposes that actor to take risks; (2) as a determinant of risky conduct, crowding from below has a stronger influence than crowding from above, which captures the opportunity to advance in rank; and (3) the effect of crowding from below is strongest after the rank ordering of the actors in a tournament becomes relatively stable, which focuses contestants' attention on proximately ranked competitors. Using panel data on NASCAR's Winston Cup Series from 1990 through 2003, we model the probability that a driver crashes his car in a race. Findings show that drivers crash their vehicles with greater frequency when their positions are increasingly at risk of displacement by their nearby, lower-ranked counterparts; the effect of crowding from below exceeds that of crowding from above; and the effect of crowding by lower-ranked contestants is greatest when there is relatively little race-to-race change in the rank ordering of drivers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.52.2.208","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics and risk-taking behavior in NASCAR racing without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Establishing such contextual effects empirically is complicated by the possibility that unobserved individual traits influence both the contexts in which people are observed and their likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. This paper presents the first systematic study of the effects of bureaucracy on entrepreneurship that accounts for such unobserved sorting processes. Analyses of data on labor market attachments and transitions to entrepreneurship in Denmark between 1990 and 1997 show that people who work for large and old firms are less likely to become entrepreneurs, net of a host of observable individual characteristics. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that this negative effect of bureaucracy does not spuriously reflect self-selection by nascent entrepreneurs into different types of firms. An important implication of this finding is that the structure of organizational populations affects the supply of nascent entrepreneurs, as well as the availability of entrepreneurial opportunities.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.52.3.387","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","4","['social context', 'entrepreneurship', 'bureaucracy']","The article discusses the influence of bureaucratic environments on entrepreneurship, highlighting the social context's role in shaping entrepreneurial activity.

Red Bank reduced cognitive uncertainty such that bankers experienced it as transient. It conveyed abstract concepts so that bankers could solve problems independently using deduction. This created an individual-centric organizational cognition. To highlight situational uniqueness, Amp Bank amplified cognitive uncertainty such that bankers experienced it as persistent. This created a collective-centric organizational cognition: because demands exceeded individuals' cognitive capacity, bankers used organizational resources to solve problems inductively.

Stable organizational traits, such as a search strategy or routine, do not imply that an organization's performance will remain stable over time or that cross-sectional differences in performance will persist. These properties create the possibility that population-level selection processes will be inefficient in that organizations with potentially superior long-run performance will be selected out. We theorize that organizational-level adaptation often results in fluctuations in current performance across time. These fluctuations may attenuate the degree to which current performance differences among organizations are indicative of future performance. As a consequence, search strategies that generate systematically different performance trajectories, even if they share a common long-run outcome, will generate differing survival rates. These ideas are explored using a formal simulation model employing the framework of NK performance landscapes. Our central finding is that selection may be systematically prone to errors and that these selection errors are endogenous to, and differ markedly across, firms' search strategies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.52.4.586","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['selection', 'organizational adaptation', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on organizational selection processes and performance metrics without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Prior research has introduced \u201cactive-learning\u201d policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly.

This is especially true in health care and national security, where this data is considered vital for a number of public health and safety initiatives. In some cases legislation has been used to establish some standards for limiting the collection of and access to such data. However, all such legislative efforts contain many provisions that allow for access to individually identifiable microdata without the consent of the data subject. Furthermore, although legislation is useful in that penalties are levied for violating the law, these penalties occur after an individual\u2019s privacy has been compromised. Such deterrent measures can only serve as disincentives and offer no true protection. This paper considers security issues involved in releasing microdata, including individual identifiers. The threats to the confidentiality of the data subjects come from the users possessing statistical information that relates the revealed microdata to suppressed confidential information. The general strategy is to recode the initial data, in which some subjects are \u201csafe\u201d and some are at risk, into a data set in which no subjects are at risk. We develop a technique that enables the release of individually identifiable microdata in a manner that maximizes the utility of the released data while providing preventive protection of confidential data. Extensive computational results show that the proposed method is practical and viable and that useful data can be released even when the level of risk in the data is high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0112","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['privacy', 'data protection', 'confidentiality']","The article discusses privacy protection and the ethical implications of releasing individually identifiable microdata, which touches on themes of data ethics and individual rights.

Despite their ubiquity, theoretical and empirical research investigating the impact of such IT-based features on online community communication and interaction is limited. Drawing on the social psychology literature, we describe an identity-based view to understand how the use of IT-based features in online communities is associated with online knowledge contribution. Specifically, the use of four categories of IT artifacts\u2014those supporting virtual co-presence, persistent labeling, self-presentation, and deep profiling\u2014is proposed to enhance perceived identity verification, which thereafter promotes satisfaction and knowledge contribution. To test the theoretical model, we surveyed more than 650 members of two online communities. In addition to the positive effects of community IT artifacts on perceived identity verification, we also find that perceived identity verification is strongly linked to member satisfaction and knowledge contribution. This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanisms through which IT features facilitate computer-mediated knowledge sharing, and it yields important implications for the design of the supporting IT infrastructure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0113","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['identity verification', 'online communities', 'knowledge contribution', 'social psychology']","The article discusses the impact of information technology on identity verification and knowledge sharing within online communities, touching on themes of social interaction and community dynamics.

This research examines how users value virtual communities and how virtual communities differ in their value propositions. In particular, this research examines the nature of trade-offs between information quantity and quality, and explores the sources of positive and negative externalities in virtual communities. The analyses are based on more than 500,000 postings collected from three large virtual investing-related communities (VICs) for 14 different stocks over a period of four years. The findings suggest that the VICs engage in differentiated competition as they face trade-offs between information quantity and quality. This differentiation among VICs, in turn, attracts users with different characteristics. We find both positive and negative externalities at work in virtual communities. We propose and validate that the key factor that determines the direction of network externalities is posting quality. The contributions of the study include the extension of our understanding of the virtual community evaluation by users, the exposition of competition between virtual communities, the role of network externalities in virtual communities, and the development of an algorithmic methodology to evaluate the quality (noise or signal) of textual data.

Our results suggest that while some resources, such as procurement-process digitization, influence Internet use in both the procurement stages, other resources, such as the diversity of organizational procurement knowledge, impact Internet use in only one stage. We also find that Internet use in the OIC stage has a more significant impact on procurement-process performance than use in search.

In our model, a seller of information goods faces customers that are heterogeneous with regard to both the marginal willingness to pay for quality and the outside opportunity. In the development stage, the seller determines the quality limit of the product. In the second stage, the seller\u2019s problem is to design the price schedule corresponding to different quality levels, taking into account production and distribution costs. We show that versioning is optimal for the seller when customers have multiple outside options or, more generally, convex reservation utilities. In addition, we show that in the optimal solution the seller discards both low-end and high-end customers. Among those that are served, the seller offers a continuum of (inferior) versions to customers with relatively low willingness to pay, and extracts full information rent from each of them. A common version with the quality limit is offered to the rest. We further prove that the seller should offer a single version when reservation utilities are either concave or linear. Through numerical experiments, we study the sensitivity of our results to changes in the cost structure and customer utilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0119","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Ang et al. (2002) published the first in-depth analysis of compensation for IT professionals juxtaposing human capital endowment (education and experience) and institutional determinants (firm\u2019s size, industry, and sector) of compensation in the Singaporean economy. In this paper, we explore the influence of particular national economies on IT workers\u2019 compensation. We draw on research into the roots of wage differentials in labor economics and build on the Ang et al. research to present a multilevel analysis of IT workers\u2019 compensation in the United States, analyzing the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Current Population Survey (CPS) data for 1997, 2001, and 2003. We find that, while institutional differences in Singapore mattered only in conjunction with individual factors, in the U.S. institutional differences had a direct effect on IT workers\u2019 wages. As tightness of IT labor supply decreased in the United States in the early 2000s, the influence of a firm\u2019s size on wages became more pronounced. Also, female IT workers and workers without a college degree fared worse than their male and college-educated counterparts as the IT job market slowed down. We suggest that factors such as presence of job search friction, diversity in the educational system, geographical differences in cost of living, labor mobility, and shortages in IT labor supply vis-\u00e0-vis demand help explain the differences among countries. We conclude by outlining the implications of these findings for IT workers, firms, and policy makers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0121","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['diversity', 'female IT workers', 'institutional differences', 'wage differentials']","The article discusses the impact of institutional differences and highlights disparities faced by female IT workers, indicating a moderate focus on diversity and equity themes.

Chin et al. (2003) completed an extensive experiment using Monte Carlo simulation that compared two different techniques for detecting and estimating such interaction effects: partial least squares (PLS) with a product indicator approach versus multiple regression with summated indicators. By varying the number of indicators for each construct and the sample size, they concluded that PLS using product indicators was better (at providing higher and presumably more accurate path estimates) than multiple regression using summated indicators. Although we view the Chin et al. (2003) study as an important step in using Monte Carlo analysis to investigate such issues, we believe their results give a misleading picture of the efficacy of the product indicator approach with PLS. By expanding the scope of the investigation to include statistical power, and by replicating and then extending their work, we reach a different conclusion\u2014that although PLS with the product indicator approach provides higher point estimates of interaction paths, it also produces wider confidence intervals, and thus provides less statistical power than multiple regression. This disadvantage increases with the number of indicators and (up to a point) with sample size. We explore the possibility that these surprising results can be explained by capitalization on chance. Regardless of the explanation, our analysis leads us to recommend that if sample size or statistical significance is a concern, regression or PLS with product of the sums should be used instead of PLS with product indicators for testing interaction effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0123","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical methods in information systems research without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Is there a set of core principles we can apply to thinking about the enabling potential of information technologies and their consequences for business and society? We present a business-centric framework and a technology-centric framework that together form a blueprint for answering these questions. The business-centric framework articulates three compelling reasons why information technology (IT) matters in business: (1) IT continually transform industry and society, (2) executive decisions about IT investments, governance, and strategy are critical to organizational success, and (3) deriving value from increasingly available data trails defines effective decision making in the digital economy. However, our conversations with the leadership of 45 business schools and our subsequent data indicate that business schools are challenged by effectively training future executives to think about these reasons and act on them as part of a forward-looking program of business education that is grounded in stable concepts. In response, the technology-centric framework provides a set of grounding concepts and stable principles about IT that have emerged over the last four decades, and leads to a natural set of consequences that can inform thinking about IT in business. We illustrate how these complementary frameworks\u2014business and technology\u2014can be combined to frame an educational program by outlining a set of key questions, by placing these questions in the context suggested by our frameworks, and by providing guidelines toward answering them.

Given this motivation, firms are unbundling their value chain processes and exploring new sourcing mechanisms. With the emergence of world-class skills and capabilities in offshore locations, new sourcing mechanisms have become available beyond traditional domestic insourcing and outsourcing. However, there is little systematic research examining how firms choose sourcing mechanisms for their business processes. This study views the digitally enabled extended enterprise as a complex system of business processes and examines how sourcing choices are made in such enterprises. It builds on the modular systems theory to posit that modularization of business processes and their underlying information technology (IT) support infrastructures are associated with the choice of sourcing mechanisms for the processes. The study tests this proposition in a sample of business process sourcing choices made by 93 medium and large U.S. firms. The results show that firms tend to choose domestic outsourcing for processes that are high in modularity and offshore outsourcing for processes that are low in modularity. Further, when processes can be detached from a firm's IT infrastructure, firms tend to use offshore outsourcing. However, when processes are tightly coupled with underlying IT infrastructure, it may be infeasible to detach processes and execute them in remote locations.

This reshapes the extended enterprise from the traditional network of upstream manufacturers and downstream retailers to include midstream third-party and manufacturer-owned referral services in the supply chain. We model competition between retailers in a supply chain with such digitally enabled institutions and consider their impact on the optimal contracts among the manufacturer, referral intermediary, and the retailers. Offline, retailers face a higher customer discovery cost. In return, they can engage in price discrimination based on consumer valuations. Online, they save on the discovery costs but lose the ability to identify consumer valuations. This critical trade-off drives firms' equilibrium strategies. We derive the optimal contracts for different entities in the supply chain and highlight how these contracts change with the entry of independent and manufacturer-owned referral services. The establishment of a referral service is a strategic decision by the manufacturer. It leads to diversion of supply chain profit from a third-party infomediary to the manufacturer. Further, it enables the manufacturer to respond to an infomediary, by giving itself greater flexibility in setting the unit wholesale fee to the profit-maximizing level. Both third-party and manufacturer-sponsored referral services play a critical role in enabling retailers to discriminate across consumers' different valuations. Retailers use online referral services to screen out low-valuation consumers and sell only to high-valuation consumers in the online channel. Our model thus endogenously derives a correlation between consumer valuation and online purchase behavior. Finally, we show that under some circumstances, it is too costly for the manufacturer to eliminate the referral infomediary.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0130","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Information Intensity, Skills, and Global Service Disaggregation","Which service occupations are the most susceptible to global disaggregation? What are the factors and mechanisms that make service occupations amenable to global disaggregation? This research addresses these questions by building on previous work by Apte and Mason (1995) and Rai et al. (2006) that focuses on the unbundling of information and physical flows. We propose a theory of service disaggregation and argue that high information intensity makes an occupation more amenable to disaggregation because the activities in such occupations can be codified, standardized, and modularized. We empirically validate our theoretical model using data on more than 300 service occupations. We find that at the mean skill level, the information intensity of an occupation is positively associated with the disaggregation potential of that occupation, and the effect of information intensity on disaggregation potential is mediated by the modularizability of an occupation. We also find that skills moderate the effect of information intensity on service disaggregation. Furthermore, we study the patterns in U.S. employment and salary growth from 2000 to 2004. Contrary to popular perception, we do not find any adverse effect in terms of employment growth or salary growth for high information-intensity occupations at the mean skill level. Our findings show that high-skill occupations have experienced higher employment and salary growth than low-skill occupations at the mean level of information intensity. Notably, high information-intensity occupations that require higher skill levels have experienced higher employment growth, though this employment growth is accompanied by a decline in salary growth. Occupations with a higher need for physical presence have also experienced higher employment growth and lower salary growth. Overall, these results imply that firms and managers need to consider the modularizability of occupations as they reallocate global resources to pursue cost and innovation opportunities. For individual workers, our results highlight the importance of continuous investments in human capital and skill acquisition because high information-intensity and high-skill occupations appear to be relatively less vulnerable to global disaggregation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0131","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['skills', 'global disaggregation', 'employment growth']","The article discusses the impact of information intensity on service occupations and their global disaggregation potential, touching on employment and skills.

Adaptive extended enterprise arrangements allow participating enterprises to leverage their combined assets for collective exploration and exploitation. In the context of extended enterprises, where significant investments have been directed toward instituting common interfaces, this study examines the question: How does the use of standard electronic business interfaces (SEBIs) enable supply chain partnerships to become more adaptive? This study conceptualizes the use of SEBIs as a boundary-spanning mechanism that helps overcome boundaries that impede knowledge transfer between enterprises in supply chains. SEBIs enables partners to gain insight into their broader environments, enriching each partner's perspective (enhanced bridging). SEBIs also help strengthen the cooperative ties between partners, motivating each partner to adapt for collective gain (enhanced bonding). Our research model is empirically tested using data collected from 41 demand-side supply chain partnerships (between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, and retailers) in the information technology (IT) industry. The results show that collaborative information exchange (CIE) between supply chain partners mediates the relationship between use of SEBIs and mutual adaptation (MA) and adaptive knowledge creation between supply chain partners. Interestingly, the use of SEBIs is found to be directly associated with MA but only indirectly associated with adaptive knowledge creation. The study points out that the strategic impacts of SEBIs go well beyond the exchange of transaction information and process integration. It also shows that multilateral, quasi-open, and information exchange\u2013and process linkage\u2013oriented SEBIs can result in both bonding and bridging across supply chain partners without binding them inflexibly to specific partners. Based on the model and results, the study offers practical implications for how SEBIs should be developed, adopted, and used.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0132","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['adaptive', 'collaborative', 'knowledge transfer']","The article discusses adaptive supply chain partnerships and collaborative information exchange, which suggest a focus on cooperation and knowledge sharing.

We propose that these capabilities augment the relational value that a firm derives from its business partners\u2014channel partners and customer enterprises\u2014in the context of the distribution channel. Two cospecialized relational assets are considered as key to realization of relational value\u2014knowledge sharing and process coupling. Hypotheses linking two IS capabilities (IS flexibility and IS integration) to the relational asset dimensions, and ultimately to firm performance, are proposed. The research model is tested based on data collected through a survey of business units of enterprises embedded in customer and channel partner ties in the high-tech and financial services industries. We find that IS integration with channel partners and customers contributes to both knowledge sharing and process coupling with both types of enterprise partners, whereas IS flexibility is a foundational capability that indirectly contributes to value creation in interfirm relationships by enabling greater IS integration with partner firms. We find that two types of relational assets are significantly associated with business performance\u2014knowledge sharing with channel partners and process coupling with customers\u2014pointing to underlying mechanisms that differentially leverage resources of different types of channel partners.

Recently, interorganizational business process standards (IBPS) enabled by information technology (IT) have been suggested as a solution to help organizations overcome this problem. Drawing on three theoretical perspectives, i.e., the relational view of the firm, institutional theory, and organizational inertia theory, we propose three mechanisms\u2014relational, influence, and inertial\u2014to explain the assimilation of IBPS in organizations. We theorize that these mechanisms will have differential effects on the assimilation of IBPS in dominant and nondominant firms. Using a cross-case analysis based on data from 11 firms in the high-tech industry, we found evidence to support our propositions that relational depth, relationship extendability, and normative pressure were important for dominant firms while relational specificity and influence mechanisms (coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures) were important for nondominant firms. Inertial mechanisms, i.e., ability and willingness to overcome resource and routine rigidities, were important for both dominant and nondominant firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0134","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['interorganizational relationships', 'normative pressure', 'institutional theory']","The article discusses interorganizational relationships and normative pressures, which touch on collaborative practices and institutional influences.

A study conducted to test this model has largely confirmed our expectations: (1) both vividness and interactivity of product presentations are the primary design features that influence the efficacy of the presentations; (2) consumers' perceptions of the diagnosticity of websites, their perceptions of the compatibility between online shopping and physical shopping, and their shopping enjoyment derived from a particular online shopping experience jointly influence consumers' attitudes toward shopping at a website; and (3) both consumers' attitudes toward products and their attitudes toward shopping at a website contribute to their intentions to purchase the products displayed on the website.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0124","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online product presentations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although total network value is maximized when everyone operates in one compatible network, we find that the technology benefits for the users depend on vendor incentives, which are driven by the existence of \u201cde facto\u201d or \u201cde jure\u201d standards. In head-to-head competition, customers are better off \u201cletting a thousand flowers bloom,\u201d fostering fierce competition that results in a de facto standard if users prefer compatibility over individual fit, or a split market if fit is more important. In contrast, firms that sponsor these products are better off establishing an up-front, de jure standard to lessen the competitive effects of a network market. However, if a firm is able to enter the market first by choosing a proprietary/incompatible technology, it can use a \u201cdivide-and-conquer\u201d strategy to increase its profit compared with head-to-head competition, even when there are no switching costs. When there is a first mover, the early adopters, who are \u201clocked in\u201d because of switching costs, never regret their decision to adopt, whereas the late adopters, who are not subject to switching costs, are exploited by the incumbent firm. In head-to-head competition, customers are unified in their preference for incompatibility when there is a first mover; late adopters prefer de jure compatibility because they bear the brunt of the first-mover advantage.

To achieve these objectives we develop a two-stage model of search intermediaries in a vertically differentiated product market. In the first stage an intermediary chooses a search engine design that specifies to which extent a firm's search rank is determined by its bid and to which extent it is determined by the product offering's performance. In the second stage, based on the search engine design, competing firms place their open bids to be paid for each referral by the search engine. We find that the revenue-maximizing search engine design bases rankings on a weighted average of product performance and bid amount. Nonzero pure-strategy equilibria of the underlying discontinuous bidding game generally exist but are not robust with respect to noisy clicks in the system. We determine a unique nondegenerate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium that is robust to noisy clicks. In this equilibrium firms of low product performance fully dissipate their rents, which are appropriated by the search intermediary and the firm with the better product. The firms' expected bid amounts are generally nonmonotonic in product performance and depend on the search engine design parameter. The intermediary's profit-maximizing design choice, by attributing a positive weight to the firms' bids, tends to obfuscate search results and reduce overall consumer surplus compared to the socially optimal design of fully transparent results ranked purely on product performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0139","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['consumer surplus', 'socially optimal', 'transparency']","The article discusses the implications of search engine design on consumer welfare and transparency, hinting at social considerations.

Consistent with the complementarity perspective, we view this specific form of IS capability as enhancing manufacturing's coordination with marketing and supply chain functions to drive manufacturing performance. Additionally, the theoretical model presented here introduces manufacturing-IS coordination, a form of coordination not considered in past research, as a key antecedent to integrated IS capability. The research thus provides a comprehensive framework for examining manufacturing performance in contexts that have been transformed by the use of advanced information systems. The theoretical model is tested using primary data collected from manufacturing firms and matched with objective manufacturing performance data from secondary sources. Results show that a firm's integrated IS capability, as well as the complementary effects of IS capability with manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain processes, are significant predictors of manufacturing performance.

We define information risk as the probability that firm-specific financial statement information pertinent to investor pricing decisions is of low precision, and use the factor-mimicking portfolio returns formed on the Dechow-Dichev [2002] accrual quality (AQ) metric to proxy for the information risk (IR) factor returns. We augment the Fama-French three-factor model with this IR factor, and find that dividend initiation and increase firms exhibit a decrease in the factor loadings on the IR factor while dividend decrease firms exhibit an increase in the corresponding factor loadings, but such changes in the factor loadings occur months prior to the dividend change announcements. The results are robust to further controls for operating risk and using an alternative measure of information risk. Further analysis on changes in information characteristics such as AQ, the probability of informed trading score (PIN), forecast dispersion, and return volatility surrounding dividend change events are consistent with the asset pricing results. Overall, we interpret our results as being consistent with investors treating the information risk associated with the precision of financial statement information as a priced risk factor, with both the precision and pricing changing in predictable directions around dividend changes. However, while we attempt to control for operating risk changes in additional tests, we cannot completely rule out changes in operating risk as a competing alternative explanation for our observed results.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00225.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and pricing without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We distinguish two broad bases for accounting measurements: input-based and output-based accounting. We argue that the structural difference in the two measurement bases leads to a systematic difference in the efficiency of the investment decisions. In particular, we show that an output-based measure has a natural advantage in aligning investment incentives because of its comprehensiveness. The (first-)best investment is achieved when the output-based measure is noiseless and manipulation free. In addition, under an output-based measure, more accounting noise/manipulation always leads to more inefficient investment choices. Therefore, if an output-based accounting measure is highly noisy and easy to manipulate in practice, the induced investment efficiency can be quite low. On the other hand, an input-based accounting measure, while not as comprehensive, may induce more efficient investment decisions than an output-based measure if some noise is unavoidable in either measure. The reason is twofold. First, input-based measures may be associated with less noise and limited manipulation in practice. Second, and more importantly, we show that under an input-based measure, a slight increase in accounting noise/manipulation may lead to more efficient investment choices. In fact, the (first-)best result is achieved when the noise/manipulability is small but positive. In other words, for an input-based measure, being less comprehensive makes small but positive accounting noise/manipulability desirable. Two extensions of the basic model are also explored.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00227.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting measurement and investment efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The model provides new explanations for several empirical findings and has some novel implications. We show that greater opacity in financial markets leads to more frequent and more severe crashes in asset prices (under a historic-cost-accounting regime). Moreover, our model indicates that historic cost accounting can make the financial market more rather than less volatile, which runs counter to conventional wisdom.

This relationship allows us to identify the circumstances under which mark-to-market accounting facilitates and when it detracts from the objective of providing an early warning of potential financial distress. We show that the reporting of an impending derivative loss by a distressed firm can actually lead outsiders to infer that the firm is in a better financial position than what they would have inferred under the silence associated with historical cost accounting.

We find that changes in ownership by institutions with large positions in a firm are consistent with informed trading. However, other previously documented proxies for private information produce results more consistent with risk-based trading (e.g., investment style) or insignificant in the presence of other proxies (e.g., fiduciary type).

We demonstrate that the quality of accounting information can influence the cost of capital, both directly and indirectly. The direct effect occurs because higher quality disclosures affect the firm's assessed covariances with other firms' cash flows, which is nondiversifiable. The indirect effect occurs because higher quality disclosures affect a firm's real decisions, which likely changes the firm's ratio of the expected future cash flows to the covariance of these cash flows with the sum of all the cash flows in the market. We show that this effect can go in either direction, but also derive conditions under which an increase in information quality leads to an unambiguous decline in the cost of capital.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00238.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting information and its influence on the cost of capital, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Such manipulation reduces accounting numbers' stewardship value and leads to inferior risk sharing.

We measure celebrity as the quantity of media coverage analysts receive in sources included in the Dow Jones Interactive database, and find that media coverage is positively related to investor reaction to forecast revisions. The effect of celebrity on the reaction to forecast revisions remains significant after controlling for forecast performance variables examined in prior studies (ex post forecast accuracy, ex ante accuracy, award status, and other variables shown to be related to forecast accuracy). While these results are consistent with the familiarity of the analyst's name affecting the market reaction, we cannot rule out that our measure of celebrity is correlated with error in the performance measures we examine and/or correlated with other unexamined dimensions of forecast performance. A content analysis of a random subsample of the media coverage of our sample analysts suggests that our findings likely are not due to the increased availability of forecast revisions. Finally, an investigation of the excess returns around the quarterly earnings announcement date suggests that market participants react too strongly to forecast revisions issued by analysts with high levels of media coverage.

I then investigate whether subjective performance evaluation is beneficial when not all the scorecard measures are contractible. It emerges that congruity of the contractible scorecard measures constrains a purely implicit incentive contract, but the first-best solution may still be obtained through a combination of formal and relational contracts.

The results of the experiment are consistent with theories of motivated reasoning that predict when and in what manner directional preferences affect how information is processed. Specifically, investors are motivated to agree unthinkingly with information that suggests they might make money on their investment, but disagree with information that suggests they might lose money. In disagreeing, long investors expect earnings to be relatively high and short investors expect earnings to be relatively low.

We test our predictions in two experiments in which participants judge the appropriateness of income-statement recognition. Experiment 1 uses Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students and varies example type (affirmative, counter) and case (revenue recognition, expense recognition) in a 2 \u00d7 2 design. Experiment 1 supports our predictions. Experiment 2 uses more experienced practitioners, and varies example type (affirmative, counter, both) in a 1 \u00d7 3 design. Experiment 2 supports the use of example-based reasoning, and indicates that practitioners in the \u201cboth\u201d condition respond as if they had only received an affirmative example. These results have implications for understanding how guidance that accompanies accounting standards can result in aggressive or conservative application of standards.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00248.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and example-based reasoning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

One part of the paper considers the effects of the observability of precision choices. We show that, generally, making precision choices private increases firms' equilibrium precision choices and also, as a by-product, their equilibrium investment choices. We further show that, when firms' precision choices are private, there may be a \u201cdisclosure trap,\u201d in which, unless investors conjecture the owner has chosen an estimate with the highest possible precision, the owner will respond to investors' conjecture by choosing an estimate whose precision is higher than investors' conjecture.\n            In a multifirm version of the model with endogenous investment, we show that the equilibrium investment by the firm increases in the precision of the firm's own estimate and decreases in the precisions of other firms' estimates.\n            Finally, we show that, in a setting where the firm's initial owner sells his stake in the firm over the course of two periods, with disclosures of estimates of the firm's value occurring prior to each sale of shares, if the precisions of the estimates are public, the equilibrium precisions of the estimates increase over time when the owner sells a sufficiently large fraction of the firm in the first period, and otherwise the equilibrium precisions of estimates remain constant over time.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00249.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting estimates and their allocational effects without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that, despite the qualitative and subjective nature of strategy-related disclosure, there is positive stock price reaction to the disclosure. The evidence suggests that investors view the disclosure as credible good news. We also find that the disclosure is associated with more positive stock price reaction when it is preceded by insider purchase transactions. This evidence is consistent with insider purchase enhancing the credibility of the disclosure. The credibility-enhancing effect is found to be stronger for firms with higher degrees of information asymmetry (younger firms, firms with lower analyst following, loss firms, and firms with higher research and development (R&D) intensity). Our evidence also indicates that predisclosure insider purchase is associated with greater future abnormal returns, suggesting that managers are privy to good news shortly before the disclosure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00250.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on stock price reactions and insider transactions without addressing any themes related to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In this paper, we experimentally test whether a characteristic of a management earnings forecast\u2014namely, whether it is disaggregated\u2014can affect its credibility. We also test whether disaggregation moderates the relation between managerial incentives and forecast credibility. Disaggregated forecasts include an earnings forecast as well as forecasts of other key line items comprising that earnings forecast. Our results indicate that disaggregated forecasts are judged to be more credible than aggregated ones and that disaggregation works to counteract the effect of high incentives. We also develop and test an original model that explains how disaggregation positively impacts three factors that, in turn, influence forecast credibility: perceived precision of management's beliefs, perceived clarity of the forecast, and perceived financial reporting quality. We show that forecast disaggregation works to remedy incentive problems only via its effect on perceived financial reporting quality. Overall, our study adds to our understanding of how managers can credibly communicate their expectations about the future to market participants.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00252.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on enhancing the credibility of management earnings forecasts through disaggregation, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Proponents have noted that markets are a simple and efficient mechanism for allocating resources in economies in which information is dispersed. In contrast to the use of markets in the broader economy, the efficiency of an internal market is determined in large part by the endogenous contractual incentives provided to the participating, privately informed agents. In this paper, we study the optimal design of managerial incentives when resources are allocated by an internal auction market, as well as the efficiency of the resulting resource allocations. We show that the internal auction market can achieve first-best resource allocations and decisions, but only at an excessive cost in compensation payments. We then identify conditions under which the internal auction market and associated optimal incentive contracts achieve the benchmark second-best outcome as determined using a direct revelation mechanism. The advantage of the auction is that it is easier to implement than the direct revelation mechanism. When the internal auction mechanism is unable to achieve second-best, we characterize the factors that determine the magnitude of the shortfall. Overall, our results speak to the robust performance of relatively simple market mechanisms and associated incentive systems in resolving resource allocation problems within firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00255.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of resource allocation and managerial incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We investigate the effectiveness of the financial reporting process at restraining earnings surprise games. Because the annual reporting process is subject to an independent audit and more rigorous expense recognition rules than interim reporting, it provides managers with fewer opportunities to manage earnings upward. We document that, relative to interim reporting, annual reporting reduces the likelihood of income-increasing earnings management and, to a lesser extent, of negative surprise avoidance, but increases the magnitude of downward expectations management. Our findings suggest that regulatory attempts to monitor corporations' internal checks and balances are likely to be more effective at curbing upward earnings management than at mitigating negative surprise avoidance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00256.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['financial reporting', 'earnings management', 'regulatory']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and earnings management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We estimate that the bias, computed as the difference between the estimates of the implied expected rate of return based on analysts' earnings forecasts and estimates based on current earnings realizations, is 2.84%. The importance of this bias is illustrated by the fact that several extant studies estimate an equity premium in the vicinity of 3%, which would be eliminated by the removal of the bias. We illustrate the point that cross-sample differences in the bias may lead to the erroneous conclusion that cost of capital differs across these samples by showing that analysts' optimism, and hence, bias in the implied estimates of the expected rate of return, differs with firm size and with analysts' recommendation. As an important aside, we show that the bias in a value-weighted estimate of the implied equity premium is 1.60% and that the unbiased value-weighted estimate of this premium is 4.43%.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00257.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial analysis and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations in business practices."],["2007","45","5","MARK BAGNOLI,\u00a0\n                     MARK BAGNOLI\n                     Purdue UniversitySearch for more papers by this authorSUSAN G.

This different information asymmetry produces new, testable implications regarding the probability of and market reaction to voluntary disclosures.

First, we analytically develop the mean and variance of the distribution of absolute discretionary accruals, and show that the expected value is an increasing function of the variance in the underlying error term from the first-stage discretionary accrual estimation model. Second, we highlight several firm characteristics that are related to the error variance in discretionary accrual estimation models. Using simulations, we show that correlation between the earnings management partitioning variable and these firm characteristics leads to an overrejection of the null hypothesis of no earnings management. Third, we provide research design suggestions to help researchers mitigate the potential bias arising from the use of unsigned measures of earnings management. Using these suggestions, we replicate a recent study, and demonstrate that the inferences change after controlling for operating volatility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00259.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

PVFs allow insiders to hedge downside risk, share performance gains, and obtain immediate large-sum cash payments for investment or consumption. On average, PVF transactions cover 30% of a sample insider's firm-specific wealth ($22 million), which is substantially larger than a typical open-market sale. PVFs systematically follow strong firm performance and precede degraded stock and earnings performance. PVFs also precede periods of negative abnormal returns relative to potential alternative investments. The documented association between PVFs and performance declines does not appear to result from the market's response to transaction disclosure, participant self-selection, or general price reversals. Thus, evidence suggests that insiders use PVFs to diversify firm-specific holdings in anticipation of performance declines.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00260.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial transactions without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

However, contrary to the perception in the accounting literature, the exclusion of variables from the MT's forecasting and pricing equations leads to an omitted variables problem that affects inferences about the rational pricing of accounting variables. Only if the omitted variables are rationally priced is their exclusion irrelevant. Failure to recognize this issue leads accounting researchers to employ the MT without appreciating how omitted variables affect the inferences they draw. We demonstrate that when additional explanatory variables are included in the MT, the rational pricing of accruals is not rejected. That is, the accrual anomaly documented in Sloan [1996] vanishes when additional explanatory variables are incorporated into the MT. We also show that in accounting research settings, where samples are large, ordinary least squares (OLS) is equivalent to the MT. As a result, accounting researchers should consider using OLS or be more explicit about the exact advantages of the MT over OLS in their research setting.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00261.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and rational pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Reply to Park and MacInnis; Schwarz; Petty; and LynchGet access","Park and MacInnis (2006, in this issue) provide the always sound advice to examine the boundaries of the focal construct, in this case attitudes. They wonder whether attitudes are capable of predicting differences in levels of personal investment and commitment to resulting behavior, and they question whether attitude dimensions such as strength and extremity, or additional dimensions and moderators, are rich enough to account for either the range of affect intensity reflected in the degree of emotional attachment or in behavioral commitment. They draw our attention to consumers' emotional attachment to brands (which they see as inherently linked to one's self-schema) and argue for a sharper delineation of the boundaries of the attitude construct. Their analysis suggests that emotional attachment is a separate relationship-based construct.             \n             \nSeveral reactions seem in order. First, we do not suggest that attitude theory can explain emotional attachment and its consequences (see also Cohen [1990], Cohen and Areni [1991], and Pham et al. [2001] for consistent attempts to separate attitudinal and affective processes). In creating the Multiple Pathway Anchoring and Adjustment (MPAA) model, we draw on relevant cognitive and motivational theory and research to better understand both attitude formation and the conditions under which attitudes are likely to guide behavior. Attitudes arise out of a range of human experience extending from direct experience and exposure to internalized information through social interaction and, yes, to \u201chot\u201d emotion-laden responses. Within attitude theory it is important to examine how these separable bases influence both attitude formation and important behavioral consequences such as commitment and resistance to change. We agree with these authors that rigorous delineations of psychological constructs (as opposed to blurring distinctions among them) is essential, but we also believe that the formation, retrieval, and reliance on attitudes to guide behavior is so central to human functioning that incorporating broader cognitive and motivational processes (rather than compartmentalizing research domains) is mandatory (see Andrade and Cohen [2006] for a specific example of a model of emotional response across diverse domains). We hope the Park and MacInnis (2006, in this issue) call for greater attention to emotional attachment and behavioral commitment will spur this type of research.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/33/1/28/1822597","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on theoretical discussions related to attitudes and emotional attachment in consumer behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

We suggest that when a brand operates in multiple product domains, extension evaluations are more complex than have been conceptualized, and favorable consumer responses may result even in the absence of the above two conditions. Our two-process contingency model proposes two dimensions of fit (brand prototype fit and product exemplar fit) and two evaluative processes (top-down and parallel attitude transfer) that drive extension evaluations in different ways, depending on the level of cognitive resources.

By implying that consumers cannot always accurately predict their need for variety, this preference inconsistency also raises the question of what factors influence consumers' tendency to overestimate their need for the flexibility offered by larger assortments. Building on the view of choice as a hierarchical decision process, this research posits that choice among assortments is a function of consumers' decision focus and, in particular, the degree to which the subsequent task of making a choice from the selected assortment is salient to consumers. The data from four experiments offer converging evidence for the moderating role of decision focus on choice among assortments.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/33/1/50/1822609","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For prevention-focused individuals, maximal frames represented either a \u201cno loss\u201d or a \u201cdeviation from the norm.\u201d The no loss representation led to maximal and minimal frames being equally persuasive.

We suggest that mere salience of the norms of a communal relationship (based on concern for the partner) relative to those of an exchange relationship (based on quid pro quo) leads to a greater degree of loss aversion.

Conversely, analytical self-referencing persuades via more traditional processing models, wherein cognitive elaboration is enhanced by relating incoming information to one's self or personal experiences, which results in a differential persuasive effect of strong versus weak arguments.

Specifically, agreement with an agent on previously loved alternatives is perceived as more diagnostic of the agent's suitability than agreement on previously hated alternatives. This article argues that the positivity effect arises from greater ambiguity about attribute ratings of hated versus loved alternatives. Three studies support this by showing that the effect is moderated by the number of attributes, the number of alternatives, and the revelation of an agent's attribute ratings, and is mediated by attribute ambiguity.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/33/4/499/1790352","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer evaluations and psychological effects without addressing any themes related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice.

Firms are modeled as long-lived assets distinguished by the timing of cash flows. The stochastic discount factor is specified so that shocks to aggregate dividends are priced, but shocks to the discount rate are not. The model implies that growth firms covary more with the discount rate than do value firms, which covary more with cash flows. When calibrated to explain aggregate stock market behavior, the model accounts for the observed value premium, the high Sharpe ratios on value firms, and the poor performance of the CAPM.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01201.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model explaining the value premium without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a battery of liquidity measures covering over 4,000 corporate bonds and spanning both investment grade and speculative categories, we find that more illiquid bonds earn higher yield spreads, and an improvement in liquidity causes a significant reduction in yield spreads. These results hold after controlling for common bond-specific, firm-specific, and macroeconomic variables, and are robust to issuers' fixed effect and potential endogeneity bias. Our findings justify the concern in the default risk literature that neither the level nor the dynamic of yield spreads can be fully explained by default risk determinants.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01203.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of bond liquidity and yield spreads without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, reflecting a purely profit-oriented analysis."],["2007","62","1","JONATHAN E.

We combine attractive elements from each of these lines of research by observing market professionals from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in a controlled environment. Analysis of over 1,500 individual decisions suggests that CBOT professionals behave differently from our student control group. For instance, professionals are better able to discern the quality of public signals and their decisions are not affected by the domain of earnings. These results have implications for market efficiency and are important in both a positive and normative sense.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01204.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['market efficiency', 'normative sense', 'decisions']","The article primarily focuses on empirical research related to market behavior and efficiency, with only a brief mention of normative implications.

Our conjectures are predicated on the idea that, until recently, large bank acquisitions were a new phenomenon, with no best practices history to inform bank managers or market investors. We hypothesize that merging banks, and investors pricing bank mergers, learn by observing information that spills over from previous bank mergers. We find evidence consistent with these conjectures for 216 M&As of large, publicly traded U.S. commercial banks between 1987 and 1999.

Given this dual role, the CEO faces a trade-off in disclosing information to the board: If he reveals his information, he receives better advice; however, an informed board will also monitor him more intensively. Since an independent board is a tougher monitor, the CEO may be reluctant to share information with it. Thus, management-friendly boards can be optimal. Using the insights from the model, we analyze the differences between sole and dual board systems. We highlight several policy implications of our analysis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01206.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of board management and CEO information disclosure without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

On the Optimal Structure of Executive Pay","We calibrate the standard principal\u2013agent model with constant relative risk aversion and lognormal stock prices to a sample of 598 U.S. CEOs. We show that this model predicts that most CEOs should not hold any stock options. Instead, CEOs should have lower base salaries and receive additional shares in their companies; many would be required to purchase additional stock in their companies. These contracts would reduce average compensation costs by 20% while providing the same incentives and the same utility to CEOs. We conclude that the standard principal\u2013agent model typically used in the literature cannot rationalize observed contracts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01208.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of executive pay structures without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2007","62","1","ROBERT JARROW,\u00a0\n                     ROBERT JARROWSearch for more papers by this authorHAITAO LI,\u00a0\n                     HAITAO LISearch for more papers by this authorFENG ZHAO,\u00a0\n                     FENG ZHAO\n                     Jarrow is from the Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University.

To capture the volatility smiles, we develop a multifactor term structure model with stochastic volatility and jumps that yields a closed-form formula for cap prices. We show that although a three-factor stochastic volatility model can price at-the-money caps well, significant negative jumps in interest rates are needed to capture the smile. The volatility smile contains information that is not available using only at-the-money caps, and this information is important for understanding term structure models.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01209.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of interest rate caps and volatility models without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In practice, the use of marking-to-market and collateralization questions this view as they introduce intermediate cash flows and alter credit characteristics. We provide a swap valuation theory under marking-to-market and costly collateral and examine the theory's empirical implications. We find evidence consistent with costly collateral using two different approaches; the first uses single-factor models and Eurodollar futures prices, and the second uses a formal term structure model and Treasury/swap data.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01210.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance related to swap pricing and collateralization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2007","62","1","CARMELO GIACCOTTO,\u00a0\n                     CARMELO GIACCOTTOSearch for more papers by this authorGERSON M.

At the industry level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in concentration.

We distinguish between firms that experienced relationship termination as a consequence of bank M&As and those that did not.

We validate several of these predictions empirically.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01234.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on asset pricing and forecasting models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2007","62","3","ROBERT BATTALIO,\u00a0\n                     ROBERT BATTALIOSearch for more papers by this authorANDREW ELLUL,\u00a0\n                     ANDREW ELLULSearch for more papers by this authorROBERT JENNINGS,\u00a0\n                     ROBERT JENNINGSBattalio is from the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.

We identify instances in which New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks experience trading floor relocations. Although specialists follow the stocks to their new locations, most brokers do not. We find a discernable increase in liquidity costs around a stock's relocation that is larger for stocks with higher adverse selection and greater broker turnover. We also find that floor brokers relocating with the stock obtain lower trading costs than brokers not moving and brokers beginning trading post-move. Our results suggest that reputation plays an important role in the NYSE's liquidity provision process.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01235.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and market behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2007","62","3","JENNIFER HUANG,\u00a0\n                     JENNIFER HUANGSearch for more papers by this authorKELSEY D.

As a consequence, in a dynamic economy the leverage of most firms is likely to differ from the \u201coptimum\u201d leverage at the time of readjustment. This paper explores the empirical implications of this observation. I use a calibrated dynamic trade-off model to simulate firms' capital structure paths.

We model pre-repurchase takeover probability as a latent variable and examine its impact on the firm's decision to repurchase shares. Given specification tests reject the Tobit model, we turn to the censored quantile regression method of Powell (1986, Journal of Econometrics 32, 143\u2013155). We find a significantly positive relation between open market share repurchases and takeover probability, and we reconcile empirical findings in previous studies that contradict predictions. Repurchase activity is inversely related to firm size, consistent with smaller firms having greater information asymmetry, and is related to temporary, but not permanent, cash flows.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01258.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance related to share repurchases and takeovers, with no mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Acquisitions also enable acquirer CEOs to improve the long-term value of overvalued holdings. Examining all firms during 1993 to 2001, we show that CEOs with higher holdings (illiquidity discount) are more likely to make acquisitions (get acquired). Further, in 250 completed acquisitions, target CEOs with a higher illiquidity discount accept a lower premium, offer less resistance, and more often leave after acquisition. Similarly, acquirer CEOs with higher holdings pay a higher premium, expedite the process, and make diversifying acquisitions using stock payment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01260.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial mechanisms and CEO behaviors related to stock and option holdings without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

At the same time, a wide futures-cash basis may trigger arbitrage trades and, in turn, affect liquidity. We test these ideas by studying the dynamic relation between stock market liquidity and the index futures basis. There is evidence of two-way Granger causality between the short-term absolute basis and liquidity, and liquidity Granger-causes longer-term absolute bases. Shocks to the absolute basis predict future stock market liquidity.

We first solve a one-period trading game in continuous-time, using an asset pricing equation that accounts for the price impact of trading. Then, in a multi-period framework, we describe an equilibrium in which traders cooperate most of the time through repeated interaction, providing apparent liquidity to one another. Cooperation breaks down when the stakes are high, leading to predatory trading and episodic illiquidity. Equilibrium strategies that involve cooperation across markets lead to less frequent episodic illiquidity, but cause contagion when cooperation breaks down.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01274.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and market behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The regions are affected by negatively correlated liquidity shocks, so liquidity coinsurance is Pareto improving. The moral hazard problem can be solved if banks are sufficiently capitalized. Under autarky a limited amount of capital is sufficient to prevent risk-taking, but when financial markets are open capital becomes insufficient. Thus, bankruptcy occurs with positive probability and the crisis spreads to other regions via financial linkages. Opening financial markets is nevertheless Pareto improving; consumers benefit from liquidity coinsurance, although they pay the cost of excessive risk-taking.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01275.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial systems and risk management without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The Determinants of Very Short-Term Corporate Yield Spreads","Employing a comprehensive database on transactions of commercial paper issued by domestic U.S. nonfinancial corporations, we study the determinants of very short-term corporate yield spreads. We find that liquidity plays a role in the determination of spreads but, somewhat surprisingly, credit quality is the more important determinant of spreads, even at horizons of less than 1 month. These results are robust across a variety of proxies for liquidity and credit risk, and have important implications for the literature on the modeling of corporate bond prices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01276.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically liquidity and credit risk, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In contrast to the standard literature, we find that transaction costs can have a first-order effect on liquidity premia.

Previous research finds that these stocks tend to be overpriced, but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks tend to be more severely overpriced. Additionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the convergence of prices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the initially overpriced stocks are negatively correlated with the time series of innovations in aggregate market liquidity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01278.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial metrics such as mispricing and liquidity without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Interstate income insurance occurs when personal income reacts less than one-to-one to state-specific output shocks. We find that insurance improved after banking deregulation, with a larger effect in states where small businesses are more important and on proprietors' income than on other components of personal income. Our explanation centers on the role of banks as a prime source of small business finance and on the close intertwining of the personal and business finances of small business owners.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01292.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of banking deregulation and its effects on personal income insurance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that under strong creditor protection, loans have more concentrated ownership, longer maturities, and lower interest rates. Moreover, the impact of creditor rights on loans depends on borrower characteristics such as the size and tangibility of assets. Foreign banks appear especially sensitive to the legal and institutional environment, with their ownership declining relative to domestic banks as creditor protection falls. Our multidimensional empirical model paints a more complete picture of how financial contracts respond to the legal and institutional environment than existing studies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01293.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['legal', 'institutional', 'creditor rights']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of financial contracts and creditor protection without addressing social justice or equity themes.

We find that habit persistence can help reproduce the nonlinearity of the spot rate process, the documented deviations from the expectations hypothesis, the persistence of the conditional volatility of interest rates, and the lead-lag relationship between interest rates and monetary aggregates.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01299.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of macroeconomic models and interest rates without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2007","83","1","Author links open overlay panelChris Downing a, Stephen Oliner b","The term structure of commercial paper rates","his paper tests a generalized version of the expectations hypothesis in the market for commercial paper.

We argue that a firm, by repurchasing its shares, sends a positive signal about itself and a negative one about its competitors. This induces the competing firms to mimic the behavior of the repurchasing firm by repurchasing themselves. Using a broad sample of US firms from the period 1984\u20132002, we show that, in concentrated industries, a repurchase announcement lowers the stock price of the other firms in the same industry. The other firms react by repurchasing themselves to undo these negative effects. Repurchases are chosen as a strategic reaction to other firms\u2019 repurchase decisions and are not motivated by the desire to time the market, i.e., to take advantage of a significantly undervalued stock price. Therefore, repurchasing firms in more concentrated industries experience a lower increase in value in comparison with their counterparts in less concentrated industries in the post-announcement era. Alternative methodologies used to estimate long-term performance confirm that it is only the repurchasing firms in low concentration industries that outperform the market, their non-repurchasing peers, and their counterparts in more concentrated industries by amounts that are economically and statistically significant.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X07000165","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of share repurchases and their strategic implications in concentrated industries, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The model predicts that, controlling for observable borrower risk, collateralized loans are more likely to default ex post, which is consistent with the empirical evidence.

Process models of internationalization propose that firms start with low commitment activities and gradually increase their commitments to international markets. However, recent empirical evidence has shown that many firms make high international commitments from the start. Our findings suggest that domestic resources and competitive action propensity affect early international commitments indirectly through domestic mindsets.

R&D decentralisation avoids having to adapt centrally developed innovations to local markets, being able to use the specific know-how of the subsidiary. In addition R&D subsidiaries can be used to source locally available external know-how. At the same time, however, R&D internationalisation intensifies the spillover of valuable know-how to competitors located in the foreign markets. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the intensity of competition in the local market in determining the size of both the benefits and costs of R&D decentralisation. It shows that when R&D is undertaken abroad in association with production, the local knowledge base is not unequivocally a pulling factor attracting R&D investments by foreign MNEs, depending on the level of local competition. The paper also shows that efficiency in reverse intra-company technology transfers is a critical factor in benefiting from technology sourcing. The results thus illustrate the complementarity of efficient internal and external knowledge management systems. In addition the model suggests that, with a fall in the cost of intra-company technology transfers, relative market size loses importance as a locational factor for R&D decentralisation.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400249","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on theoretical models of R&D organization and competitive dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We propose that the salient features of accelerated and early internationalisation by the newly internationalising firm are best captured in a framework that is found at the intersection of entrepreneurial and internationalisation perspectives, which we propose be known as international entrepreneurial dynamics. We discuss such a framework in terms of entry points and pathways mapped by firms as they probe the IB arena, and the key factors that impinge on behaviour and strategic choices. In line with recent developments in the entrepreneurship literature, these are grouped into three milestones of entrepreneurial processes that extend across national boundaries: (1) the discovery of new opportunities; (2) the deployment of resources in the exploitation of these opportunities; and (3) the engagement with competitors. Implications for MNE and internationalisation theory are discussed.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400271","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['internationalisation', 'entrepreneurial', 'opportunities']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of international business and entrepreneurship without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, in emerging economies, with their institutional environment context characterized by low resource munificence and continuous economic liberalization, a theoretical extension of the current perspective is needed. This paper introduces new parameters by focusing on specific ownership advantages and strategic actions that firms have to develop in response to the institutional characteristics of the emerging economies when they decide to pursue outward FDI. The focus here is on international venturing that requires a firm to engage in activities for new business creation in a foreign country rather than simply seek to distribute a product in another nation. It is shown empirically that the relationship between firm-specific ownership advantages and international venturing is moderated by the degree of home industry competition and export intensity. In addition, such a relationship is mediated by the intensity of corporate entrepreneurial transformation in the form of innovation, new business creation, and strategic renewal.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400278","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['emerging economies', 'institutional environment', 'corporate entrepreneurship']","The article discusses the context of emerging economies and the need for firms to adapt to their institutional environments, which hints at a consideration of broader social and economic factors.

It has also been shown that NIE firms are often controlled by founding families who make key strategic decisions, and that they rely heavily on network linkages when developing their FDI strategies. What is less clear, however, is how the corporate governance factors in NIEs, the risk preferences of the main shareholder constituencies, and the network-based business culture affect the decision to undertake FDI in emerging markets. This paper explores the entry mode and location choices of firms from an Asian NIE (Taiwan) in an emerging market (the People's Republic of China). It shows that the choice of equity stake in an affiliate depends upon the extent of family and institutional share ownerships in the parent company. High-commitment entry is found to be positively associated with the affiliate being located in areas with strong economic, cultural and historic links with the parent company. Furthermore, the entry mode and location decisions appear to be interrelated, with the parent's equity stake in the affiliate depending inter alia upon the location within China, and the favoured location depending inter alia upon the equity stake.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400279","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['corporate governance', 'entry mode', 'emerging markets']","The article primarily focuses on foreign direct investment strategies and corporate governance without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We also suggest that MNCs are likely to take a higher ownership stake in response to strong internal pressure to sustain their internal legitimacy at the corporate level of their institutional environment. We also propose that MNCs are more likely to exchange ownership for legitimacy in local industries than in host countries, and in local markets with a high level of political instability than in those with a low level of political instability.

We develop network-based measures that incorporate not only the volume of trade but also the influence that a country has on the international trading system. These measures incorporate the structure and function of the network, and may provide a more meaningful approach to globalization than current measures based on trade volumes. We find that, in terms of participation and influence in the network, global trade is hierarchical, with a core\u2013periphery structure at higher levels of trade, though integration of smaller countries into the network increased considerably over the 1990s. The network is strongly \u2018balkanized\u2019 according to geography of trading partners, but not as strongly by income or legal origin.

This paper, then, presents a conceptual model describing the relationship between expatriate assignments and intra-organizational career success. Specifically, theories of career mobility are used to develop a framework for outlining the factors likely to determine whether expatriate assignments help or hinder the advancement of employees who have worked as international assignees.

In the federative MNC, the headquarters and the subsidiaries are involved in a perpetual bargaining process. Thus a crucial issue is what power bases are there that the different actors in the federative MNC can use to influence strategic decisions. In this paper, we focus on the power bases associated with the local business network in which the different subsidiaries are embedded, and on the headquarters\u2019 knowledge concerning these networks. A causal model is developed and tested with data from 97 subsidiaries in 20 MNC divisions. The results indicate that the strength and influence of a subsidiary's local business network are determined by the extent to which the subsidiary provides technology within the MNC. The fact that the business network is strong does not suffice to augment the intra-organisational power of a subsidiary. In addition, our investigation also provides support for the idea that, when the headquarters has a sound knowledge of the subsidiaries\u2019 business networks, it is better able to balance or moderate the influence of strong subsidiaries. The paper concludes by pointing out a potential dilemma facing the headquarters of the federative MNC: externally embedded subsidiaries can provide access to a variety of competencies, but they may also reduce the subsidiaries\u2019 interest in contributing to the overall performance of the MNC.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400292","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['power', 'influence', 'subsidiaries']","The article primarily focuses on the dynamics of power and influence within multinational corporations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Founding our arguments in resource dependence theory, we propose that, while the subsidiary is relatively small, increasing subsidiary size will correlate with increasing resources in the subsidiary and a consequent increase in subsidiary autonomy. This positive linear relationship persists until an inflection point is reached and subsidiary autonomy begins to decline. We argue that this is due to increasing subsidiary size bringing increasing coordination complexity, a need for greater inputs of managerial experience and expertise, and growing interdependence between the subsidiary and the rest of the corporation. Employing a sample of 313 Australian subsidiaries of mostly US, UK, European and Japanese MNCs, we use a three-step hierarchical regression to investigate controls only, linear and quadratic effects of subsidiary size on subsidiary autonomy.

Consumer involvement (CI) is proposed as a pivotal construct to capture behavioural homogeneity, for the identification of market segments. Results from a five-country study demonstrate how the strategic framework can be valuable in managerial decision-making. First, there is evidence for the cultural invariance of the measurement of CI, allowing a true comparison of inter- and intra-cultural behavioural homogeneity. Second, CI influences purchase behaviour, and its evaluation provides a rich source of information for responsive market segmentation. Finally, a decomposition of behavioural variance suggests that national-cultural environment and nationally transcendent variables explain differences in behaviour.

Moreover, we apply Williamson's new institutional economics to investigate the influence of institution building on multinational enterprises' dual investment choice. In the context of transition economies, we test empirically the possible moderating effect of a host country's institutional environment.

Using a sample of 192 IJVs in an emerging market, this study finds general support for our theoretical model. Our research validates that countering opportunism involves a system-wide effort that integrates economic and social mandates, unifies ex ante and ex post mechanisms, controls both egoistic and non-egoistic motivations, and combines organizational-level and individual-level forces. For partners from individualist cultures, economic ordering forces (contractual and structural) are stronger than social ordering forces (relational and justice) in relation to opportunism resistance, whereas for partners from a collectivistic culture, social ordering forces are relatively stronger than economic ordering forces for this end.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400300","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","5","['justice', 'equity', 'opportunism', 'social exchange']","The article discusses themes of 'justice' and 'equity' in the context of international joint ventures, indicating a moderate focus on social considerations alongside traditional business practices.

However, asymmetries are found in the extent to and speed with which private-label share changes in cyclical up- versus downturns. Consumers switch more extensively to store brands during bad economic times than they switch back to national brands in a subsequent recovery. In addition, the switch to private-label brands is faster than the opposite movement to national brands after the recession ends. Finally, not only are consumers more prone to buy private labels during economic downturns, but some keep buying them when bad economic times are long over as well, leaving permanent \u201cscars\u201d on national brands\u2019 performance level. The authors argue that national-brand manufacturers can mitigate the effect of an economic downturn on their shares by intensifying their marketingsupport activities in recessions.

However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i.e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, market knowledge breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms.

Analysis of 25 quasi experiments involving 125 suppliers and $385 million in procurement contracts suggests that the larger the number of bidders, the larger the economic stakes, and the less visible the price in an auction, the more positive is the impact on the interorganizational relationship. Large price drops (higher savings) over the course of the event have a detrimental effect on the buyer\u2013supplier relationship. For auctions in which the lowest bidder wins, there is a decrease in opportunism suspicions as the economic stakes of the auction increase, and there is an increase in opportunism suspicions in auctions with greater price visibility.

Despite their strong validity, these theories have not been incorporated into mainstream management science literature because of their qualitative nature. In this article, the author proposes a theory of intraperson games (TIG) to fill this important gap. Building on social welfare literature and standard (multiperson) game theory, the TIG defines two types of intraperson players, and each has a unique strategy set. The first type, the efficiency agent, attempts to maximize the total utility for the entire set of selves that reside in a person's mind. The second type, the equity agent, strives to balance the utilities that each of these selves receives. The TIG states that an individual decision is the outcome of the strategic interaction between the efficiency agent and the equity agent. Thus, standard consumer utility theory is a special case of the TIG if the role of the equity agent is ignored. A mathematical apparatus is provided for the TIG and is defined in a way similar to standard (multiperson) game theory. As a general quantitative theory, the TIG can be applied to many different contexts across disciplines, including, but not limited to, management science. The author demonstrates one such application for variety-seeking behavior and shows that stochastic variety seeking is a mixed-strategy equilibrium in an intraperson game.

Locating the Firm on a Profit Function","When deciding about changes in levels of multiple marketing investments aimed at improving profits, managers need to know whether they are on the uphill side or the downhill side of the profit function with respect to each investment variable. Spending errors made by an uphill-located firm that believes that it is a downhill-located firm can have serious consequences. This article offers an econometric \u201cdiagnostic tool\u201d to infer a company's current location on a multivariable profit function and to determine the changes in investments that will take the company to the neighborhood of the maximum profit. The authors apply the proposed approach to daily newspaper industry data and investigate the optimality of companies' allocation behaviors with respect to three marketing efforts: investments in quality, distribution, and advertising space sales effort. A novel feature of this problem setting is that it involves a \u201cdual-revenue\u201d market with possibly interrelated demands for subscriptions and advertising space. The authors derive normative rules for marketing investments in four dual-revenue market types. The empirical analysis finds that daily newspapers' dual revenues are positively interrelated and that a majority of these companies are located near the optimal level of spending for quality, a surprising finding considering that previous studies have characterized marketing managers as overspenders. Indeed, when these companies are suboptimal, they are much more likely to be underspending (i.e., they are located on the uphill side of the profit function) than overspending. In addition, the research furnishes estimates of sales elasticities with respect to quality, personal selling, and distribution investments, which are sparsely available in the extant literature.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.2.026","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of profit functions and marketing investments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors evaluate the usefulness of brand equity estimates obtained from store-level data for monitoring the health of a brand. They use a random coefficients logit demand model calibrated on store-level scanner data to track brand equity estimates over time in two consumer packaged goods categories that experienced several new product introductions during the period of the empirical investigation. Using these tracked measures, the authors also study the impact of marketing actions, such as advertising, sales promotions, and product innovations, on brand equity. They find that the brand equity estimates effectively capture the high equity of strongly positioned popular brands and brands that command a significant price premium in niche markets. Using an example, the authors illustrate how these brand equity estimates can be used to monitor changes in brand equity, which measures such as market share may fail to capture. The substantive results indicate that advertising has a positive effect on brand equity in both the product categories, whereas the effect of sales promotions is not significant in either category. Furthermore, the results reveal that new product innovations have a positive impact on brand equity and can explain a significant proportion of its variation. Overall, the analysis shows that a brand manager can track brand equity using store-level data, gain insights into the drivers of the brand's equity, and manage these drivers to achieve brand equity targets.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.2.061","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brand equity management and marketing actions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To evaluate exit decisions, they propose a Bayesian belief-updating model of learning embedded in a logit model that incorporates market- and firm-specific factors. The estimated evolution of beliefs over time enables the authors to determine whether firms use market information to update their prior beliefs about market attractiveness. The authors empirically investigate the market exits of new entrant discount airlines from city-pair markets. The results suggest that a combination of several market and firm factors influences exit behavior.

This article considers an alternative strategy in which resale is only partially restricted; specifically, resale is banned on spot but still allowed in advance. Using a two-period model in which buyers have discreet valuations, the authors show that it is possible for partial resale to outperform no resale (and also unrestricted resale at the other extreme) in terms of seller profitability when the following conditions hold: when the seller has limited capacity, when the number of high-valuation buyers is small enough, and when the number of early arrivers is not too large.

This raises the question whether managers, who have limited own experience, take their competitors' prior decisions into account when deciding on their own entry timing and size and whether there is value in doing so. To address these questions, the authors estimate a sequential hazard/Poisson regression model on the top 75 European grocery retailers' decisions to enter the Eastern European market. Indeed, firms pay close attention to prevailing practices in their industry. Prior entries first serve as legitimation but eventually become a deterring factor. Moreover, rather than just imitating the most popular or modal decision when determining the own entry timing and size, managers pay closer attention to the actions of their home competitors, react to prior entries of same-format competitors differently from those of different-format competitors, and adjust the observed industry practice for the specificity of their own resources. The authors show that managers are justified in taking the combined industry wisdom into account; deviations from prevailing industry practice, in terms of both timing and size, hurt the efficiency of their operations in subsequent years. Thus, attempts to develop own, distinct entry rules tend to be dysfunctional. Moreover, corrective actions are easier to implement along the size than along the time dimension; the detrimental effects of entering at a different time from the industry norm persist and even become amplified over time, whereas the negative impact of size deviations is temporary.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.2.196","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the strategic decisions of retail firms entering transition economies, emphasizing managerial decision-making and industry practices without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Moreover, the relative importance of the cognitive system as a driver of responsiveness is greater in firms with a low market share and in markets with low entry barriers for new competitors.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.018","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['responsiveness', 'organizational systems', 'customers', 'competitors']","The article primarily focuses on organizational responsiveness to market dynamics without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, in contrast to the importance prior literature credits to the \u201cchicken-and-egg\u201d paradox in these markets, the temporal pattern (i.e., Which leads to which?) of indirect network effects remains unstudied.

In contrast, this study investigates the negative side of customer experience and tests the harmful impact of consumer negative voice on firms' stock returns. Based on a longitudinal real-world data set that matches consumer negative voice (complaint records) in the airline industry with firm stock prices, this article finds that higher levels of current consumer negative voice harm firms' future idiosyncratic stock returns. In addition, this harmful impact is robust (albeit different across airline companies) after latent heterogeneity and traditional finance fundamentals are considered. These findings enable marketers and corporate financers to be more confident with customer equity theory and customer relationship management. In addition, armed with \u201chard\u201d data (record-based, longitudinal), this research helps relieve criticisms against prior studies that are based on \u201csoft\u201d data (survey-based, cross-sectional). To financial analysts, this research suggests that, all else being equal, they should rate downward the stocks of firms that are shadowed by harmful consumer negative voice. In today's high-tech environment with blogs and online forums, the damage caused by negative voice may be nontrivial and should not be ignored. Overall, this research demonstrates to managers that investments in reducing consumer negative voice could indeed make financial sense in terms of promoting firm-idiosyncratic stock returns.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.075","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['consumer negative voice', 'customer experience', 'harmful impact']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of consumer negative voice rather than addressing social justice or ethical themes.

Using the automotive retailing context as the setting for the study, the authors address the following question: Can online infomediaries serve as a viable mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination? They draw on a unique and extensive data set of consumers who report on the information they found when using online buying services (OBS) as part of their new vehicle purchase process. The analysis of the data set shows that consumers who obtain price information pay lower prices (for the same product), whereas consumers who obtain product information pay higher prices. Although this points to the existence of distinct consumer segments, this knowledge is of limited value without a viable mechanism that enables firms to identify and target these customer segments specifically. On the basis of consumer usage patterns of OBS, the authors uncover distinct OBS clusters and empirically demonstrate that the use of these different clusters is associated with predicted differences in consumer outcomes. They also show that the differential use of OBS clusters is systematically related to underlying consumer characteristics. They discuss the relevance of the findings for automobile dealers and manufacturers and for other industries in which online infomediaries have established a significant presence.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.089","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['price discrimination', 'market segmentation', 'consumer characteristics']","The article primarily focuses on market segmentation and price discrimination without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, some facets of thought-world differences enhance the market performance of the business unit through a direct effect that outweighs the negative effect mediated by the quality of cooperation between marketing and sales. Market performance is enhanced if one side plays the customers' advocate while the other plays the products' advocate. Market performance is also enhanced if one side plays the advocate of short-term considerations while the other plays the advocate of long-term considerations. In contrast, differences between marketing and sales in regard to product knowledge and interpersonal skills are deleterious to market performance.

However, as promotion depth increases, consumers might lower their expectations of future price, which in turn may threaten future choice when prices return to normal levels. This research examines how promotion frame (percentage off versus cents off) moderates the effect of promotion depth on postpromotion price expectations and choice. The findings indicate that compared with cents-off promotions, high-depth percentage-off promotions lead to higher postpromotion price expectations. Likewise, postpromotion choice is higher when high-depth promotions are framed in percentage-off than cents-off terms.

The authors aim to answer this question by contrasting, synthesizing, and simultaneously testing three scientometric perspectives\u2014universalism, social constructivism, and presentation\u2014on the influence of article and author characteristics on article citations. They study all articles published in a sample of five major journals in marketing from 1990 to 2002 that are central to the discipline. They count the number of citations each of these articles has received and regress this count on an extensive set of characteristics of the article (i.e., article quality, article domain, title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity) and the author (i.e., author visibility and author personal promotion). They find that the number of citations an article in the marketing discipline receives depends more on \u201cwhat is said\u201d (quality and domain) and \u201cwho says it\u201d (author visibility and personal promotion) than on \u201chow it is said\u201d (title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity). The insights gleaned from this analysis contribute to the marketing literature and are relevant to scientific stakeholders, such as the management of scientific journals and individual academic scholars, as they strive to maximize citations. They are also relevant to marketing practitioners; they inform practitioners on characteristics of the academic journals in marketing and their relevance to decisions they face. Conversely, the insights also raise challenges regarding how to make journals accessible and relevant to marketing practitioners: (1) Authors visible to academics are not necessarily visible to practitioners; (2) the readability of an article may hurt academic credibility and impact, but it may be instrumental in influencing practitioners; and (3) it remains questionable whether articles that academics assess to be of high quality are also managerially relevant.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.171","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['visibility', 'accessibility', 'relevance']","The article primarily focuses on the factors influencing article citations in marketing, with minimal emphasis on socially progressive themes.

The authors argue that this conflict results from the assumption that consumer recovery expectations are monolithic and largely homogeneous, driven mainly by behavioral, relational, or contextual stimuli. Instead, recovery scenarios involving high-involvement (i.e., self-relevant) goods and service failures may activate closely held, identity-related cultural models that, though ultimately applied to regain balance (a foundational schema), differ according to their sociocultural heritage and create a range of unique consumer recovery preferences. The authors empirically identify three embodied cultural models\u2014relational, oppositional, and utilitarian\u2014that consumers apply to goods or service failures. Furthermore, the authors discuss implications for service recovery research and services marketing practice and introduce adaptive service recovery diagnostics that enable providers to identify and respond to consumers' varying recovery preferences.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.3.194","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['cultural models', 'identity', 'sociocultural heritage', 'consumer preferences']","The article discusses how recovery expectations vary based on identity-related cultural models, indicating an awareness of diversity and sociocultural factors in consumer behavior.

The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing.

The academic literature has not addressed how customers behaviorally respond to overbooking experiences, such as downgrading, denied service, or upgrading. In this article, the authors use the econometric technique of conditional difference-in-differences analysis to study the effect of such incidences on customer usage patterns in an airline context. They find that customers who experience negative consequences of revenue management significantly reduce the amount of their transactions with the airline, whereas upgraded customers exhibit only weak positive responses. The effects of the negative events are stronger for high-value customer groups, whereas significant effects of positive events can be found only for a low-value customer group.

In this paradigm, established relationships are viewed as survivors of a selection process whose parameters are the conduct of the partners, dependencies between the partners, and external adversities in the markets. Selection has the effect of culling certain combinations of these parameters, such as attempts at unilateral control when the partner is not dependent. The effect of selection is to carve out patterns that appear as associations between parameters, for example, between unilateral control and dependence. Traditionally, such associations have been interpreted as causal effects of one parameter on the other. This study shows that quasi-Darwinian selection may sometimes be the more correct explanation of an observed association. The guiding principle can be summarized by the motto \u201cselection creates association.\u201d As an explanatory paradigm, selection may rival causation. The quasi-Darwinian framework applies to any type of marketing relationships in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. Examples include all relationships in the supply chain, relationships between service providers and customers, and relationships between sales representatives and customers. The article develops the quasi-Darwinian framework in generality, but it emphasizes applications to business-to-business relationships. When associations between relationship parameters are carved out by selection, they can be interpreted as adaptations, and their descriptive meaning has normative implications; if partners in a relationship pattern their conduct according to these associations, on average, they may enhance the longevity of their relationship.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.4.048","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['selection', 'relationships', 'normative implications']","The article discusses the concept of selection in marketing relationships, which hints at relational dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

Drawing on stratified random samples for three major markets\u2014namely, the United States, Japan, and Germany\u2014and a total of 1770 consumers, the empirical results suggest that the studios that produce motion pictures can increase their revenues by up to 16.2% through sequential distribution chain timing and order changes when applying a common distribution model for all movies in a country and that revenue-optimizing structures differ strongly among countries.

This article sheds light on the returns on this investment using an event study that considers the impact of more than 1200 casting announcements on trading behavior in a simulated and real stock market setting. The author finds evidence that the involvement of stars affects movies' expected theatrical revenues and provides insight into the magnitude of this effect. For example, the estimates suggest that, on average, stars are worth approximately $3 million in theatrical revenues. In a cross-sectional analysis grounded in the literature on group dynamics, the author also examines the determinants of the magnitude of stars' impact on expected revenues. Among other things, the author shows that the stronger a cast already is, the greater is the impact of a newly recruited star with a track record of box office successes or with a strong artistic reputation. Finally, in an extension to the study, the author does not find that the involvement of stars in movies increases the valuation of film companies that release the movies, thus providing insufficient grounds to conclude that stars add more value than they capture.

This article is the first to employ a game-theoretical approach to investigate consumer contest design issues, including prize structure, segmentation, and handicapping. First, the authors find that both skill distribution and the number of contestants play an important role in determining the optimal prize structure in consumer contests. Specifically, if the skill distribution has the increasing hazard-rate property, it is optimal for a marketer to use a winner-take-all design. In large contests, for the winner-take-all approach to be optimal, it suffices to have the increasing hazard-rate property only at the high end of the skill distribution. Second, increasing contest size is beneficial to the marketer. Third, a less dispersive skill distribution leads to higher consumption by consumers at all skill levels and thus is beneficial to the marketer. The marketer may achieve less dispersive skill distributions by (1) segmenting or screening contestants according to their skill levels and (2) adopting a performance evaluation scheme that handicaps high-skilled contestants.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.71.4.140","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer contest design without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using four years of longitudinal data (N = 396), the authors compare the relative efficacy of these four perspectives for driving exchange performance and provide empirical insights into the causal ordering among key interorganizational constructs. The results demonstrate the parallel and equally important roles of commitment\u2013trust and relationship-specific investments as immediate precursors to and key drivers of exchange performance. Building on the insights gleaned from tests of the four frameworks, the authors parsimoniously integrate these perspectives within a single model of interfirm relationship performance consistent with a resource-based view of an exchange. Managers may be able to increase performance by shifting resources from \u201crelationship building\u201d to specific investments targeted toward increasing the efficacy or effectiveness of the relationship itself to improve the relationship's ability to create value.

The results confirm the existence of two theoretically ideal configurations. As hypothesized, channels in these ideal configurations make greater contributions to their firms' performance than do channels in alternative configurations.

First, they replicate this basic finding in France and find that it is robust to time and region aggregation and data duration. Second, because of regional variation in chain locations and the limited research on the relative effect of chains on market shares, they link chain effects to market shares in France. The authors find that (1) chain effects explain more variation in market share than either time or region effects and (2) the addition of chain effects attenuates region-specific effects. Thus, chain structure is both another source of regional variation in demand and an important consideration in its own right.

The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.042","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of pricing information and competition without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Despite decades of study, little systematic research exists on a central question: Why do the acquisitions of some firms perform better than those of others? The work that has examined this question has mostly focused on deal-specific variables (i.e., how the acquisitions are conducted). In this article, the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable\u2014namely, product capital\u2014that affects acquisition performance and predicts which firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors also present a mechanism by which product capital affects performance\u2014 namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment of targets' innovation potential. This article shows that firms with high product capital (i.e., those with greater product development and support assets) make smarter acquisition decisions. Such firms are better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying this potential to gain competitive advantage. The performance consequences of this superiority in the selection and deployment of target firms manifest in the long-term financial rewards to the acquiring firm. The results of an analysis of acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry across seven countries and over 11 years (1992\u20132002) provide empirical support for the arguments.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.057","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate acquisitions and product capital without addressing any themes related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice.

Therefore, this research examines the effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self or for the family, focusing specifically on the dual role of emotions in serving these stakes as a provider of resources and information. The authors theorize that (1) the valence dimension of discrete emotions influences resources, thus fostering or hindering the processing of aversive health information, whereas (2) the self-/other-relatedness dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with the focal referent in the message (self or family) to determine compatibility. In Experiments 1\u20133, the authors demonstrate that when people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility hinders processing of the message. In Experiment 4, the authors track emotions before and after exposure to a health message to demonstrate that the observed effect occurs because of an increase in the negative emotional state in compatible situations when people process disease-related information.

A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty).

The authors examine alternative theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group, stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast, and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher postpurchase evaluations.

Because preferences are often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks).

A mall-intercept field study shows that consumers with a chronic disposition to be promotion focused own more new high-technology goods and newly launched repeat-purchase items than prevention-focused consumers. There is no difference in ownership of products that have been available for many years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when risks associated with a really new product are not specified to consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for products that are not portrayed as new. Mediation analyses in both laboratory studies show that the effect of regulatory focus on purchase intentions for new products is due to concerns about the performance of the new technology, which are more pronounced among prevention-focused consumers.

The authors contrast the efficacy of comparative and noncomparative new information about a target brand when the initial impression of the brand is positive or negative. A body of extant research shows that positive initial impressions change more in the face of comparative information than when the same information is noncomparative and does not mention a competitor. The authors replicate this effect for positive initial impressions but deduce and show that the opposite is true for negative initial impressions.

Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase.

They illustrate the procedure using household-level scanner-panel data on breakfast cereals and replicate the substantive results using data on ketchup. The authors find that (1) omission of state dependence in demand biases inference of firm behavior (i.e., tacit collusion is erroneously inferred when firms are competitive); (2) observed retail prices are consistent with a pricing model in which both manufacturers and retailers are forward looking (i.e., they incorporate the effects of their current prices on their future profits), but firms have short time horizons when setting prices (i.e., they look ahead by only one period, suggesting that firms are boundedly rational in their dynamic pricing behavior); and (3) even a myopic pricing model of firms that accounts for state dependence in demand is a reasonable approximation of the observed prices in the market.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.434","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical procedures related to pricing behavior and does not address any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, the resultant increase in consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article, the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes. They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an increase in repeat purchases.

However, preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high.

In most industries, competing firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters.

In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a \u201cprevention orientation,\u201d or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a \u201cpromotion orientation.\u201d When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3).

In such situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they may be uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV). They find that consumer learning can result in a win\u2013win situation for both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall CLV with consumer learning than without. The key driver of this result is the change in the retention rate with and without learning.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.529","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer learning and service quality in a technical and profit-oriented context, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They find substantial variations in the SR effects across brands, categories, and consumers. They explore possible drivers for these differences and find that higher-market-share, higher-priced, and more frequently promoted brands tend to gain share and that reduction in the number of sizes, reduction in the number of SKUs, and change in SKU share in the category are important in affecting change in a brand's purchase share after the SR. They also find that SRs lead to an increase in category purchase incidence and quantity for highly state-dependent consumers and frequent buyers but a decrease in category purchase and quantity for mildly state-dependent consumers and infrequent buyers. In addition, SRs tend to cause more changes in brand choice probabilities among consumers of lower state dependence and higher price and promotion sensitivity.

With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI\u2014a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers\u2014using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.560","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of marketing strategies and customer data utilization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

On a store visit, households maximize utility across several categories subject to an overall budget constraint. Then, they choose to purchase a subset of categories, in which they select a specific brand and an associated quantity level. Under their assumptions for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/ substitutability across categories. In addition, it accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the estimation. Thus, the three key features of multicategory models proposed in the literature are all reflected in the framework. The authors provide an empirical application of the methodology using four categories from the Stanford market basket data\u2014laundry detergent, fabric softener, toilette tissue, and paper towel. The results indicate that, in general, cross-category effects, as measured by the cross-category price elasticities between brands in the categories, are small, and they arise mostly through consumers\u2019 joint purchase incidence decisions rather than at the purchase quantity decision conditional on brand choice.

The essence of this approach is to simulate latent choice data that are consistent with the observed aggregate data. When the augmented choice data are made available in each iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the dynamics of consumer buying behavior can be explicitly modeled. The authors first demonstrate the validity of the method with a series of simulations and then apply the method to an actual store-level data set of consumer purchases of refrigerated orange juice.

In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions.

Ranking providers based on the product of relevance and bid price performs well and is robust across varying degrees of correlation.

Regardless of the allocation mechanism, sponsored search revenues are lower when users\u2019 attention decays quickly at lower ranks, emphasizing the need to develop better user interfaces and control features. The search engine can address initial inscience of relevance scores by modifying rank allocations over time as it observes clickthroughs at each rank.

The approximation coincides with the independent case derived previously in the limit as the correlation vanishes and also agrees with the two-design exact solution.

We call this an M/DN/1 queue. There are potential numerical problems inverting Laplace transforms associated with this queue because the service distribution is discontinuous. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of numerical transform-inversion methods in analyzing this queue. We first derive continuity properties of the steady-state distribution of wait in the M/DN/1 queue. Then, we show analytically how continuity properties affect the performance of the Fourier method for inverting transforms. In particular, continuity is not required in all derivatives for best performance of the method. We also present a new inversion method specifically for the M/DN/1 queue. Finally, we give numerical experiments comparing these and four other inversion methods. Although no method clearly dominates, the recursion method performs well in most examples.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0148","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of queue performance and numerical methods without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

Different from traditional subgradient-based approaches, we design two new methods that attempt to circumvent or obviate the nondifferentiability of the objective function, so that standard differentiable optimization techniques could be used. These methods, called the perturbation technique and the barrier-Lagrangian reformulation, are implemented as initialization procedures to provide a warm start to a theoretically convergent nondifferentiable optimization algorithm. Our computational study reveals that this two-phase strategy produces much better solutions with less computation in comparison with both the stand-alone nondifferentiable optimization procedure employed, and the popular Held-Wolfe-Crowder subgradient heuristic. Furthermore, the best version of this composite algorithm is shown to consume only about 3.19% of the CPU time required by the commercial linear programming solver CPLEX 8.1 (using the dual simplex option) to produce the same quality solutions. We also demonstrate that this initialization technique greatly facilitates quick convergence in the primal space when used as a warm start for ergodic-type primal recovery schemes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0158","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical optimization methods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The problem is \ud835\udca9\ud835\udcab-hard and very difficult to solve in practice as no good mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation has been found for the packing problem. We propose an algorithm based on the well-known Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition where the master problem deals with the production constraints on the rectangles while the subproblem deals with the packing of rectangles into a single bin. The latter problem is solved as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP), which makes it possible to formulate a number of additional constraints that may be difficult to formulate as MIP models. This includes guillotine-cutting requirements, relative positions, fixed positions and irregular bins. The CSP approach uses forward propagation to prune inferior arrangements of rectangles. Unsuccessful attempts to pack rectangles into a bin are brought back to the master model as valid inequalities. Hence, CSP is used not only to solve the pricing problem but also to generate valid inequalities in a branch-and-cut system. Using delayed column-generation, we obtain lower bounds of very good quality in reasonable time. In all instances considered, we obtain similar or better bounds than previously published. Several instances with up to n = 100 rectangles are solved to optimality through the developed branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0181","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in operations research without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

ERPS approaches a given MDP by iteratively dividing it into a sequence of smaller, random, sub-MDP problems based on information obtained from random sampling of the entire action space and local search. Each sub-MDP is then solved approximately by using a variant of the standard policy-improvement technique, where an elite policy is obtained.

ETAQA exploits the repetitive structure of the infinite portion of the chain and derives a finite system of linear equations. In contrast to the classic techniques for solution of such systems, the solution of this finite linear system does not provide the entire probability distribution of the state space, but simply allows calculation of the aggregate probability of a finite set of classes of states from the state space, appropriately defined. Nonetheless, these aggregate probabilities allow for computation of a rich set of measures of interest such as the system queue length or any of its higher moments. The proposed solution approach is exact and, for the case of M/G/1-type processes, compares favorably to the classic methods as shown by detailed time and space complexity analysis. Detailed experimentation further corroborates that ETAQA provides significantly less expensive solutions when compared to the classic methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0160","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution for Markov processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2007","19","2","Emily K.

Thus, organizations have invested heavily in training their employees to use IT in a disciplined, scientific way to make process improvements. This has spawned such popular initiatives as Six Sigma, yielding significant returns, but at considerable investment in training in statistical-analysis and decision-making tools. Can aspects of the decision-making process be automated, letting humans do what they do best (create, define, and measure) and machines (e.g., learning machines) do what they do best (analyze)? We propose an automated intelligent manufacturing system (AIMS) for analysis and decision making that mines real-time or historical data, and uses statistical and computational-intelligence algorithms to model and optimize enterprise processes. The algorithms employed involve a regression support vector machine (SVM) for model construction and a genetic algorithm (GA) for model optimization. Performance of AIMS was compared to Six-Sigma-trained teams employing statistical methodologies, such as design of experiments (DOE), to improve a simulated manufacturing operation, a three-stage TV-manufacturing process, where the objectives were to maximize yield, minimize cycle time and its variation, and minimize manufacturing costs, which were affected by conflicting defects and their causes. AIMS generally outperformed the teams on the above criteria, required relatively little data and time to train the SVM, and was easy to use. AIMS could serve as a productivity springboard for enterprises in existing and emergent technologies, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology/life sciences, where environment and miniaturization may make human monitoring and intervention difficult or infeasible.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0171","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical advancements in manufacturing and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

All coefficients are assumed to be nonnegative and all decision variables are binary. A new exact algorithm is presented, which makes use of aggressive reduction techniques to decrease the size of the instance to a manageable size. A cascade of upper bounds is used for the reduction, including an improved version of the Caprara-Pisinger-Toth bound based on upper planes and reformulation, and the Billionnet-Faye-Soutif bound based on Lagrangian decomposition. Generalized reduction techniques based on implicit enumeration are used to fix variables at their optimal values. In order to obtain lower bounds of high quality for the reduction, a core problem is solved, defined on a subset of variables. The core is chosen by merging numerous heuristic solutions found during the subgradient-optimization phase. The upper and lower bounding phases are repeated several times, each time improving the subgradient method used for finding the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the upper bounds. Having reduced the instance to a (hopefully) reasonable size, a branch and bound algorithm based on the Caprara-Pisinger-Toth framework is applied. Computational experiments are presented showing that several instances with up to 1,500 binary variables can be reduced to fewer than 100 variables. The remaining set of variables are easily handled through the exact branch and bound algorithm. In comparison to previous algorithms the framework does not only solve larger instances, but the algorithm also works well for instances with smaller densities of the profit matrix, which appear frequently when modeling various graph problems as quadratic knapsack problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0172","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution to a mathematical problem without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The problem is to serve a number of customers at minimum cost without violating the customers\u2019 time-window constraints or the vehicle-capacity constraint. In this paper, we propose a two-stage algorithm for the VRPTW. The algorithm first minimizes the number of vehicles with an ejection pool to hold temporarily unserved customers, which enables the algorithm to go through the infeasible solution space. Then it minimizes the total travel distance using a multi-start iterated hill-climbing algorithm with classical and new operators including generalized ejection chains, which enable the algorithm to search a larger neighborhood. We applied the algorithm to Solomon\u2019s 56 VRPTW instances and Gehring and Homberger\u2019s 300 extended instances. The experimental results showed that the algorithm is effective and efficient in reducing the number of vehicles and is also very competitive in terms of distance minimization. The m-VRPTW is a variant of the VRPTW in which a limited number of vehicles is available. A feasible solution to m-VRPTW may contain some unserved customers due to the insufficiency of vehicles. The primary objective of m-VRPTW is to maximize the number of customers served. We extended our VRPTW algorithm to solve m-VRPTW and the experimental results showed consistently good performance of the algorithm when compared with other methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0186","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for solving a logistics problem with no mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Since it is difficult to optimize directly on a placement, a number of topological representations have been presented in the literature. One of the most successful is the sequence pair representation. As opposed to previous papers using sequence pair, we do not make use of the corresponding constraint graph, but interpret the sequences as a packing order in a constructive algorithm. All placements generated are semi-normalized, i.e., each module is moved as far left and down as possible according to the current packing contour. It is shown that the two interpretations are equivalent for any minimum-area placement, and for a given sequence pair the new interpretation results in a placement using no more area than the constraint graph interpretation. The transformation runs in O(nlog log n) time and it is able to handle various constraints on the location of modules.

A through connection at a station is a connection between an arrival flight and a departure flight at the station, both of which have the same fleet type assigned to them, which ensures that the same plane flies both legs. Typically, passengers are willing to pay a premium for through connections. The through-assignment model (TAM) identifies a set of profitable throughs between arrival and departure flights flown by the same fleet type at each station to maximize the through benefits. TAM is usually solved after obtaining the solution from FAM. In this sequential approach, TAM cannot change the fleeting to get a better through assignment, and FAM does not take into account the through benefits. The goal of the combined through-fleet-assignment model (ctFAM) is to come up with a fleeting and through assignment that achieves the maximum combined benefit of the integrated model. We give a mixed integer-programming (MIP) formulation of ctFAM that is too large to be solved to even near optimality within allowable time for the data obtained by a major U.S. airline. We thus focus on neighborhood search algorithms for solving ctFAM, in which we start with the solution obtained by the previous sequential approach (that is, solving FAM first, followed by TAM) and improve it successively. Our approach is based on generalizing the swap-based neighborhood search approach of Talluri (1996) for FAM, which proceeds by swapping the fleet assignment of two flight paths flown by two different plane types that originate and terminate at the same stations and the same times. An important feature of our approach is that the size of our neighborhood is very large; hence the suggested algorithm is in the category of very large-scale neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithms. Another important feature of our approach is that we use integer programming to identify improved neighbors.

That framework approximates the desired function value by a finite linear combination of transform values, depending on parameters called weights and nodes, which are initially left unspecified. Alternative parameter sets, and thus algorithms, are generated and evaluated here by considering power test functions. Real weights for a real-variable power algorithm are found for specified real powers and positive real nodes by solving a system of linear equations involving a generalized Vandermonde matrix, using Mathematica. The resulting power algorithms are shown to be effective, with the parameter choice being tunable to the transform being inverted. The powers can be advantageously chosen from series expansions of the transform. Experiments show that the power algorithms are robust in the nodes; it suffices to use the first n positive integers. The power test functions also provide a useful way to evaluate the performance of other algorithms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0217","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of algorithm development without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The proposed Stochastic Response Surface (SRS) Method iteratively utilizes a response surface model to approximate the expensive function and identifies a promising point for function evaluation from a set of randomly generated points, called candidate points. Assuming some mild technical conditions, SRS converges to the global minimum in a probabilistic sense. We also propose Metric SRS (MSRS), which is a special case of SRS where the function evaluation point in each iteration is chosen to be the best candidate point according to two criteria: the estimated function value obtained from the response surface model, and the minimum distance from previously evaluated points. We develop a global optimization version and a multistart local optimization version of MSRS. In the numerical experiments, we used a radial basis function (RBF) model for MSRS and the resulting algorithms, Global MSRBF and Multistart Local MSRBF, were compared to 6 alternative global optimization methods, including a multistart derivative-based local optimization method. Multiple trials of all algorithms were compared on 17 multimodal test problems and on a 12-dimensional groundwater bioremediation application involving partial differential equations. The results indicate that Multistart Local MSRBF is the best on most of the higher dimensional problems, including the groundwater problem. It is also at least as good as the other algorithms on most of the lower dimensional problems. Global MSRBF is competitive with the other alternatives on most of the lower dimensional test problems and also on the groundwater problem. These results suggest that MSRBF is a promising approach for the global optimization of expensive functions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0182","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for optimization without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity, which are necessary for a higher woke score."],["2007","19","4","I.

Streamlining web-site navigation is further motivated by the availability of comprehensive site-visit traces such as shopping carts and click-stream logs. We incorporate such sales and browsing patterns for the autonomous design of web catalogs by reducing the expected click count it takes to find related items. We first model catalog design as a task of placing items onto catalog pages, leading to a quadratic assignment formulation. For a more extensive redesign, such as when the number and location of links on each page are also decision variables, we propose a two-stage optimization procedure to ensure that click-count reduction is not achieved at the cost of excessive page cluttering. Our analysis reveals that an optimized catalog is robust against shifts in browsing behavior and that simplistic interfaces are preferred for users at either end of the experience spectrum.

Prior to dissemination, tabular data need to be processed to avoid disclosure of individual confidential information. Cell suppression is one of the most widely used techniques by NSAs. Optimal procedures for cell suppression are computationally expensive with large real-world data sets, so heuristic procedures are used. Most heuristics for positive tables (i.e., cell values are nonnegative) rely on the solution of minimum-cost network-flows subproblems. A very efficient heuristic based on shortest paths already exists, but it is only appropriate for general tables (i.e., cell values can be either positive or negative), whereas in practice most tables are positive. We present a method that sensibly combines and improves previous approaches, overcoming some of their drawbacks: it is designed for positive tables and requires only the solution of shortest-path subproblems\u2014therefore being much more efficient than other network-flows heuristics. We report extensive computational experience in the solution of randomly generated and real-world instances, comparing the heuristic with alternative procedures. The results show that the method, currently included in a software package for statistical data protection, fits NSA needs: it is extremely efficient and provides good solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0185","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data protection and does not address any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

We illustrate this by extending four single-solution metaheuristics (hill-climbing, simulated annealing, tabu search, and a hybrid metaheuristic) to population-based variants using our asynchronous cooperative mechanism.

The QAP arises in many diverse settings, is known to be NP-hard, and can be solved to optimality only for fairly small instances (typically, n \u2264 30). Neighborhood search algorithms are the most popular heuristic algorithms for solving larger instances of the QAP. The most extensively applied neighborhood structure for the QAP is the 2-exchange neighborhood. This neighborhood is obtained by swapping the locations of two facilities; its size is therefore O(n2). Previous efforts to explore larger neighborhoods (such as 3-exchange or 4-exchange neighborhoods) were not very successful, as it took too long to evaluate the larger set of neighbors. In this paper, we propose very large-scale neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithms when the size of the neighborhood is very large, and we propose a novel search procedure to enumerate good neighbors heuristically.

While some progress has been made since then, contemporary authors argue that limited dialogue between operations management and behavioral researchers continues to restrict the interpretability of such studies. Drawing on expertise from both operations and behavioral research, and motivated by a case example, we intend to further this dialogue. In doing so, we outline interdisciplinary commonalities and several methodological pitfalls that those studying the links between resource constraints and operational performance should take into account when developing new research. These issues range from appropriate model conceptualization to operationalization for empirical studies. Recommendations for appropriately confronting methodological concerns related to these issues are provided.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.08.004","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['behavioral factors', 'interdisciplinary', 'methodological concerns']","The article discusses the integration of behavioral factors into operations management, which hints at a recognition of broader social influences on business practices.

In some particular industries (i.e., music), the Internet has also provided consumers with unprecedented opportunities to consider retail offers involving physical goods (i.e., CDs) alongside specialized services. As shown in this paper, these circumstances have important implications for the design and management of customer relationships. These circumstances also permeate relationships across retail and wholesale echelons in music supply chains. In particular, an empirical analysis shows that online consumer access to information on CD retail markups compels retailers to market a level of service quality that is consistent with that markup information. However, limitations in consumer access to markup data, available only to wholesalers and to Internet retailers, allow retailers to inversely link their markups to the fulfillment service quality offered to consumers with wholesaler support.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.11.013","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of e-service quality and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The quality and cost of a product or service offered in the market is a function, not only of the capabilities of the firm, but also the supplier network providing inputs to the enterprise. To remain competitive, organizations are increasingly implementing supplier development programs to maintain capable and high performance supply bases. This paper presents a conceptual model of an organization's efforts to improve supplier performance. Then latent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM) is used to test the model with data for 215 supplier development experiences from US manufacturing firms. The results suggest that evaluation and certification efforts are the most important supplier development prerequisites before undertaking operational knowledge transfer activities such as site visits and supplier training. Furthermore, collaborative inter-organizational communication is identified as important supporting factor in transforming an organization's efforts to develop suppliers into supplier performance improvements.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.02.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier development', 'performance', 'knowledge transfer']","The article primarily focuses on improving supplier performance through operational strategies and knowledge transfer, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The results are based on a sample of 186 announcements of ERP implementations, 140 SCM implementations, and 80 CRM implementations. Our analysis of the financial benefits of these implementations yields mixed results. In the case of ERP systems, we observe some evidence of improvements in profitability but not in stock returns. The results for improvements in profitability are stronger in the case of early adopters of ERP systems. On average, adopters of SCM system experience positive stock returns as well as improvements in profitability. There is no evidence of improvements in stock returns or profitability for firms that have invested in CRM. Although our results are not uniformly positive across the different enterprise systems (ES), they are encouraging in the sense that despite the high implementation costs, we do not find persistent evidence of negative performance associated with ES investments. This should help alleviate the concerns that some have expressed about the viability of ES given the highly publicized implementation problems at some firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.02.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the financial performance and profitability of enterprise systems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The use of organizational theory to formulate propositions regarding the effects of such factors is especially scarce in the TQM literature. This study uses institutional theory and contingency theory as the basis to test a number of such propositions. First, a model of TQM and organizational performance is developed. Then using survey data, the effects of five contextual factors \u2013 three institutional factors and two contingency factors \u2013 on the implementation of TQM practices and on the impact of TQM on key organizational performance measures are analyzed within a TQM\u2013performance relationships model framework. The three institutional factors include TQM implementation, ISO 9000 registration, and country of origin, and the two contingency factors include company size and scope of operations. The results show that the implementation of all TQM practices is similar across subgroups of companies within each contextual factor. In addition, the effects of TQM on four performance measures, as well as the relationships among these measures, are generally similar across subgroup companies. Thus, for the five contextual factors analyzed, the overall findings do not provide support for the argument that TQM and TQM\u2013performance relationships are context-dependent.

Since no solid theory exists, managers are uncertain whether both formality and discretion can be simultaneously applied, though it is clear that both are needed in R&D projects. This study aims to develop a model that conceptualizes and brings empirical evidence for the relationship between formality, discretion and R&D project performance. More than 1500 participants from 62 R&D projects, and 248 customer representatives in one high technology electronics company responded to questionnaires that measured formality, discretion, uncertainty, and additional control variables. Each project's performance was assessed using the company's information system on deviation from objectives in unit-cost (in US$), total project cost (in US$), time-to-market (in months), project product mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR), and customer satisfaction. Results demonstrated that formality and discretion are distinct constructs of project execution. Each was found to positively affect R&D project performance; moreover, interaction existed in their relationships with performance. In other words, the positive relationship between formality and the performance achievement in R&D projects is stronger in projects that allow higher discretion than in projects that restrict members\u2019 discretion.

Achieving optimal benefits from non-financial audits will, however, require that auditors and their clients obtain a greater understanding of and appreciation for the appropriate roles, responsibilities and skills of the non-financial auditor. This research uses data obtained from surveys of 126 practicing non-financial auditors and 400 non-financial audit clients in Australasia to test two propositions about the roles and requirements of non-financial auditors. The results indicate that non-financial auditors believe they are providing a style of auditing that is strongly focused on developing continuous improvement of client's quality systems. Non-financial auditors also appear to have a desire to meet what they perceive to be the requirements of certified organizations by emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement focused auditing. However, their clients have the opposite perception believing that they are getting less continuous improvement focused auditing than they would like, and more compliance auditing than they need. The results show that client organizations are, in general, looking for a more balanced approach to non-financial auditing in terms of compliance and continuous improvement. The evidence also suggests that a major constraint identified relates to some fundamental issues of auditor independence. This dilemma created is apparent both in the understanding of what the appropriate role of the auditor is (in both the mind of the client and the auditor), and in the nature of the different roles each plays as a stakeholder in a quality system.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.02.005","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['auditor independence', 'continuous improvement', 'quality systems']","The article discusses the roles and responsibilities of non-financial auditors with a focus on continuous improvement, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

However, researchers have suggested that computer-mediated interaction with suppliers may not be conducive to strong supplier relationships in general and to trust in particular. This paper compares two computer-mediated sourcing tools (email negotiation and Internet reverse auctions) with face-to-face negotiation. Information richness theory suggests that the different media will produce different impacts relating to sellers\u2019 trust in buyers. Data are generated with a simulation experiment using 117 subjects. We found that information richness affects seller\u2013buyer trust: Sellers who used face-to-face negotiation, the richest medium in the study, always reported higher trust in their buyer counterparts than did sellers using Internet reverse auctions. There were also some trust advantages of face-to-face negotiation over email and limited advantages of email over reverse auctions. We also found that procurement complexity influences the relationship between information richness and trust. As hypothesized, when face-to-face negotiation is used, procurement complexity has no effect on seller trust. When reverse auctions are utilized, the greater the complexity of the purchase, the less the seller trust. However, when email is used, greater procurement complexity is associated with greater seller trust, and there are no differences in trust between the email and face-to-face channels. Finally, we found that sellers\u2019 trust in buyers is positively associated with sellers\u2019 desire for future dealings with the buyer.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.02.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['trust', 'sourcing mechanisms', 'supplier relationships']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of sourcing mechanisms and their impact on supplier trust, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Further, most prior studies that compare journals have relied on single-item measures of such evaluation dimensions as quality and relevance. In order to address these research gaps, a survey instrument targeted to purchasing and supply management academics was implemented to explore how they evaluate and rate journals considered important for advancing the field of PSM. The three highest-rated journals in this study that publish PSM research are the Journal of Operations Management, the Journal of Business Logistics, and the Journal of Supply Chain Management. Four journal evaluation constructs emerged: Journal Quality, Journal Reputation, PSM Practitioner Relevance, and PSM Research Relevance. The results provide guidance for PSM scholars with respect to journals that contribute to the knowledge base in PSM, as well as support an extended understanding of conceptual bases for how scholars evaluate the journals they read and in which they publish.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.02.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on evaluating academic journals in purchasing and supply management without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In this paper we examine the influences of MMI in each of four stages of new product development (NPD) on new product time and success. A path analysis of data collected from 467 completed NPD projects indicates that increased MMI in each stage of product development is respectively associated with greater product competitive advantage, which in turn is associated with higher project return on investment (ROI). Greater MMI is also significantly associated with longer product commercialisation (PC) stages of new product development, but the data indicate little significant relationship between NPD project time and project return on investment. Hence, increased MMI may require added NPD time, but this drawback appears to be outweighed by the added benefits accrued to greater product competitive advantage.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing-manufacturing integration and its impact on product development and competitive advantage, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2007","25","2","Matthias Holweg,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Matthias Holweg\n                     \n                        m.holweg@jbs.cam.ac.uk\n                     \n                     Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1AG, United KingdomTel.: +44 1223 760 583; fax: +44 1223 339 701.Search for more papers by this author","The genealogy of lean production","Lean production not only successfully challenged the accepted mass production practices in the automotive industry, significantly shifting the trade-off between productivity and quality, but it also led to a rethinking of a wide range of manufacturing and service operations beyond the high-volume repetitive manufacturing environment. The book \u2018The machine that changed the World\u2019 that introduced the term \u2018lean production\u2019 in 1990 has become one of the most widely cited references in operations management over the last decade. Despite the fact that the just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing concept had been known for almost a decade prior, the book played a key role in disseminating the concept outside of Japan. While the technical aspects of lean production have been widely discussed, this paper sets out to investigate the evolution of the research at the MIT International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) that led to the conception of the term \u2018lean production\u2019. Furthermore, the paper investigates why \u2013 despite the pre-existing knowledge of JIT \u2013 the program was so influential in promoting the lean production concept. Based on iterating series of interviews with the key authors, contributors and researchers of the time, this paper presents an historical account of the research that led to the formulation and dissemination of one of the most influential manufacturing paradigms of recent times.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects and historical development of lean production without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Longitudinal research data, based on inventory trends, provide insights on JPM's diffusions and its uneven results. Latter-day puzzling lapses and disappointments, among Japanese as well as Western companies, raise questions about JPM's sustainability, as well as some of its changing manifestations.

Managed supply chains offer the promise of added value through proactive cooperative efforts among participating firms. However, as a strategic alliance, managed supply chains represent a form of social dilemma: supply chain alliances may fail because participating firms fear opportunistic behavior on the part of other alliance participants, and as a consequence underinvest their information and resources into the alliance. The interdependence structure of the alliance may contribute to this problem. Viewing managed supply chains as a form of social dilemma also identifies solutions that may be implemented unilaterally by individual firms or jointly by the alliance to maintain the \u201cindispensable virtue\u201d of high trust that allows supply chains to effectively create added value.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.005","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['social dilemma', 'trust', 'cooperative efforts']","The article discusses managed supply chains as a social dilemma, emphasizing the importance of trust and cooperation among firms.

However, despite these widespread prescriptions, the potential for supplier opportunism means that supermarket retailers are either skeptical or have failed to make such category management relationships with key suppliers work. Drawing on agency, transaction costs, and network theory, we synthesize insights from qualitative fieldwork with retailer and supplier managers and primary data from 73 category managers in U.K. supermarket retailers to empirically examine antecedents and consequences of category-level focal supplier opportunism. Our findings suggest that focal supplier opportunism decreases retailer category performance and increases militant behaviors among non-focal suppliers in the category supply chain. Consistent with retailer fears, we find that focal suppliers with significant influence in retailers\u2019 category management efforts are more likely to engage in opportunistic behavior. However, our results also reveal that retailer fears that being dependent on a focal supplier will lead to greater supplier opportunism are largely unfounded, while supplier dependence on the retailer is also unrelated to focal supplier opportunism. Finally, we find that retailers\u2019 ability to monitor \u2013 but not to punish \u2013 its focal suppliers is negatively related to opportunistic behavior among focal suppliers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of category management and supplier relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

While all suppliers adopted the program as an apparent response to coercive institutional pressures from their customer, the study focuses on the effects of such pressures on internal information processing and the behavior of the actors involved. The study therefore addresses a significant gap in the institutional theory literature concerning the question of how managers reconcile potential conflicts between externally imposed institutional demands and internal operational efficiency constraints. Specifically, the supplier development process is conceptualized using two different approaches: one based on assumptions of rational efficiency, the other based on assumptions of institutional image construction. Five propositions were tested using quantitative data from the customer and interview data from the suppliers. Overall, the two propositions based on image construction were supported while only one proposition of the three for the rational decision making approach was partially supported. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding how a firm's institutional context influences the implementation and use of operation management strategies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.009","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['institutional theory', 'coercive pressures', 'image construction']","The article discusses institutional pressures and the implications of image construction in supplier development, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in operations management.

Although Canada's abundance of natural resources led to the development of primary industries in the 17th and 18th centuries, the manufacturing industry was not significant until the early 19th century. Four representative manufacturing industries are discussed to illustrate the overall trend in the chronological evolution of Canadian manufacturing in the 19th and 20th centuries. The role and impact of factors such as transportation, electricity, foreign investment, particularly by U.S. entrepreneurs, and government support for industry is reviewed to understand their impact on manufacturing as it has evolved to the present. It appears that these were indeed influential and thus are factors that other countries in a less developed stage of their manufacturing evolution may look to for directions.\n            \n            Our analysis also shows that Canadian manufacturing which began by producing simple items in small volumes due to geographical diversity and the absence of a large market, moved into the mass manufacturing age only in the 20th century. But in the 21st century due to competition from low labour cost countries Canada has moved back to customized manufacturing though in sophisticated goods such as aircraft manufacturing and biotech. While there are bright spots in Canadian manufacturing, recent studies also show that work needs to be done to produce more value added products and ensure Canadian manufacturing competitiveness in the global market place.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.014","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on historical developments in Canadian manufacturing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our focus for this study was the Fred Harvey Company, which operated a highly successful string of restaurants and hotels along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad line starting in 1876, reaching its peak around 1912, and continuing until the early 1950s. Fred Harvey was a visionary businessman who understood many of the key concepts guiding the most successful service operations today. This article describes the operating system Harvey used for delivering 15 million meals per year in 65 restaurants extending over a span reaching from Chicago to San Francisco. The underpinnings of Harvey's system foretold concepts considered new today, particularly the service profit chain [Heskett, J., Jones, T., Loveman, G., Sasser Jr., W.E., Schlesinger, L., 1994] and its reliance on a clear operations strategy supported by well-trained, loyal employees and a congruent system of measurement. It is significant that Harvey achieved his success without the advantages of modern information systems by relying, instead, on his iconic leadership, dogged attention to mundane details, and the service culture he was able to embed throughout the far-flung enterprise. The Harvey story is an example of ahead-of-its-time operations thinking, but it also asks us to attend more broadly to the history of the field \u2013 as does this entire special issue \u2013 as a source of inspiration and grounding.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.06.002","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['service culture', 'leadership', 'operations strategy']","The article primarily focuses on historical business practices and operational strategies without addressing contemporary social issues or ethical critiques.

In the 1950s, a team led by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon, which also included Bonini and Winters, worked on aggregate production planning and forecasting and published a series of papers and a book. The literature contains reports of at least 73 applications of their work in four companies and three application studies. Holt et al.'s work and its visibility led to a renaissance of the field of operations and supply chain management as we know it today and brought two paradigm changes in the domain and the role of operations and supply chain management. First, seemingly unrelated and non-managerial individual functions started to emerge as parts of an integrated system of managing production. Second, aggregate production planning brought to forefront the central role of operations management by linking it with supply chains and other functions in the organization.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.06.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on historical contributions to operations management without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Elwood Spencer Buffa first published his textbook, Modern Production Management, in 1961. He had degrees in business and engineering and had worked as an industrial engineer. He was also part of the UCLA\u2013RAND academic complex whose operations researchers coined the term management science and conceived the idea of The Institute of Management Sciences. Buffa coined the term operations management and consolidated knowledge from various streams of production management, including operations research and industrial engineering, into a coherent managerial framework.\n            \n            Modern business education had started to emerge around 1959 after reports from the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation recommended improving research and analytical approaches. Many business schools created courses in POM. At the time, no single book covered what we now call production and operations management. The POM faculty at most business schools, including Columbia's Graduate School of Business, adopted Buffa's book enthusiastically when they introduced courses in \u201cproduction management\u201d. Buffa was an extraordinary visionary who covered supply chain management, design for manufacturing, quality management, service operations, and computer applications and the automated factory. The POM community pursued these issues more actively 2 or 3 decades later.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.06.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the historical development of production and operations management without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques.

The scale and complexity of these machines meant their realisation was dependent upon the latest industrial advances like parts standardization and machine tool technology. As a result Babbage committed large amounts of his time and money to the theoretical and empirical study of advanced production and engineering practice.\n            \n            This paper argues that Charles Babbage deserves to be recognised as a pioneer in the field of operations management.

Another major evolution along a different dimension is now underway: it is from a material-based economy to an information-based economy. In the past, the product\u2013service dichotomy has proved useful as an organizing principle for the study of operations management. Today, however, a material\u2013information categorization of products and services appears to be equally important and useful. The information sector now comprises the major share of the U.S. private economy and includes many of the largest industrial sectors and firms. We discuss the implications of this evolution for research and teaching in operations management (OM).\n            \n            The basic questions addressed here are: In what ways are information products, services, processes and chains similar to, or different from, those in the material world? To what extent is it possible to manage operations in information industries using the existing operations management concepts and techniques? The conclusions are mixed. To a great extent, traditional concepts are indeed applicable and useful. However, there are significant differences. For example, quantification and measurement pose a fundamental problem in the study of information industries. As a result, there are difficulties in analyzing some of the most basic OM issues related to productivity, cost, value, and transformation. Nevertheless, the process-centric methods of operations management can be quite effective in analyzing firms and industries that produce information goods and services. An understanding of process economics and information chains is also central to the analysis of competition given the impact of new technologies on processes, firms, information chains and information industries. We conclude that while there is much in the information sector that can be addressed with our current toolkit, some very interesting and challenging issues still remain open for research. From the perspective of management education too, operations management in the information economy is an area of growing importance, with some easy wins and some significant challenges.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.11.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['information economy', 'operations management', 'process-centric']","The article primarily focuses on the evolution of operations management in the context of an information economy, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

By 2000, services comprised almost 80% of U.S. employment. This rapid growth was caused by several factors including changing population lifestyles, deregulation, and new and improved infrastructure including the widespread availability of new technologies. With the service sector surpassing 50% of the U.S. economy in the 1950s, researchers \u2013 especially economists \u2013 began to examine the characteristics of services and attempt to apply some of the concepts that were developed and proven in manufacturing. From these early efforts there emerged a growing demand for business schools to develop both research agendas and courses in service operations. Beginning at the Harvard Business School in the early 1970s, and continuing through to the present, research and courses in service operations have evolved from simply applying basic manufacturing concepts in a service environment to recognizing the need for a trans-disciplinary approach appropriately suited to the particular characteristics of service operations. This article traces the evolution of service operations from its immediate pre-business school days through its early years as an academic discipline in business schools to the present, identifying \u201cpioneers\u201d in service operations who truly blazed a previously unmarked trail that many have since followed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.11.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the historical development of service operations management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, NSD empirical investigations have been hindered by the lack of psychometrically sound measurement items and scales. This paper reports a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called NSD competence. NSD competence reflects an organization's expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. This competence is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: NSD process focus, market acuity, NSD strategy, NSD culture, and information technology experience. In the first stage of measure development, we analyse judgment-based, nominal-scaled data collected through an iterative item-sorting process to assess the tentative reliability and validity of the proposed measurement items. Our results demonstrate that a reduced set of measurement items have reasonable psychometric properties and, therefore, are useful inputs for multi-item measurement scale development. In the second stage of measurement development, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of the five NSD competence dimensions using survey data collected from a sample of retail bank key informants and confirm the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the proposed five multi-item scales. The NSD competence scales developed in this research may be used to advance scholarly understanding and theory in NSD. Further, these NSD scales may provide a useful diagnostic and benchmarking tool for managers seeking to assess and/or improve their firm's service innovation expertise.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.07.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service development in retail banking without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We form hypotheses using the value chain to specify the expected financial impact of SCM systems. By examining the change in financial performance pre- and post-adoption controlling for industry median changes in performance, we find that SCM systems increase gross margin, inventory turnover, market share, return on sales, and reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses. We also provide a model showing how process improvements around supply chain initiatives combine to improve overall performance.

Antecedents include embeddedness with suppliers, supply base rationalization, and supplier selection based on product development capabilities. Product innovation and quality are modeled as returns of supplier integration in product development. We also assess the moderating role that firm size may play in the relationships we posit. Our research framework relies primarily on the social network perspective (SNP) and using a sample of 157 firms we found support for many of the posited hypotheses. Specifically, we found that embeddedness with suppliers is positively related to supply base rationalization and supplier selection based on product development capabilities. Supply base rationalization has a significant positive impact on gray-box integration (i.e., suppliers working along side the customer's engineers for product development) but not black-box integration (i.e., suppliers carry out on their own the development of components or parts for the customers). On the other hand, selecting suppliers based on their product development capabilities leads to higher levels of both gray-box and black-box integration. Only gray-box integration manifests statistically significant positive effects towards product innovation. The effects of black-box integration are negligible. Product innovation exhibits strong positive effects on quality. We also found partial support for the moderating impact of firm size. Supply base rationalization practiced by small firms has a statistically significant negative impact on black-box integration but there is no statistically significant effect for large firms. Supply base rationalization is statistically related to gray-box integration only for large firms. Finally, the positive effects of product innovation on quality are more potent for large firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.009","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier integration', 'product development', 'firm size']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supplier integration and product development without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper investigates whether improving the project plan can lead to improved success for high-risk projects. A quality of planning index was designed to explore how the presence of high risk affects the quality of planning and project success. The index includes managerial aspects such as costs, human resources, procurement and quality, as well as organizational support aspects based on organization maturity models. In a field study based on data collected from 202 project managers regarding their most recent projects, it was found that the levels of risk at the beginning of projects has no effect on their final success. Drilling down to find an explanation for this surprising phenomenon, we found that in the presence of high risk, project managers significantly improve their project plans. Hence, in high-risk projects, better project plans improve all four dimensions of project success: schedule overrun, cost overrun, technical performance and customer satisfaction. However, in low-risk projects, better project plans did not contribute to reducing schedule or cost overruns. In other words, while endless risk management tools are developed, we found that improving the project plan is a more effective managerial tool in dealing with high-risk projects. Finally, the paper presents the most common planning tools currently being used in high-risk projects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.12.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on project management and risk without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we investigate the process-model which posits that the relationship between IT investment and financial performance is mediated by operational performance, albeit in the manufacturing sector using firm level data. We examine the process-model using publicly available sector level data from 1960 to 1999 in the manufacturing, retail and wholesale sectors of the U.S. economy. Our results provide strong support for the process-model and highlight inter-sector variations, suggesting that different contextual factors may be at play in the three sectors.

The alignment of the purchasing function with business strategy is essential, but previous work links better performance with the implementation of specific purchasing practices. This article develops a different approach focused on purchasing capabilities rather than purchasing practices and proposes that purchasing's contribution to business performance depends on the degree to which purchasing capabilities fit with and support the business strategy. By adapting the Theory of Production Competence to the purchasing context, this article distinguishes two levels of fit: between purchasing strategic objectives and purchasing capabilities, defined as \u201cpurchasing efficacy,\u201d and between business strategy and purchasing strategic objectives, which is viewed as an immediate consequence of the strategic integration of purchasing. The interaction between both levels of fit influences business commercial and financial performance, and an empirical analysis of 141 industrial companies supports this proposition.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the strategic importance of purchasing in relation to business performance without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Many researchers have studied how perceptions of e-service quality dimensions relate to perceptions of higher order evaluations such as overall satisfaction and customer loyalty. However, in this study, we turn toward operational practice, examining relationships between e-service process attributes and e-service quality dimensions. Our intent is to identify potential drivers of e-service quality that managers may use as levers to improve their operations. The study employs a cross-sectional regression analysis of publicly available data collected from an online rating site. The study sample consists of over 1000 online retailers from several retailing industry segments. The data collection and analysis are innovative due to the lack of operations management research utilizing public data sources and the increased generalizability of results obtainable from multi-sector data sets. The results identify operational drivers associated with customer ratings of e-service quality, and provide guidance for future research on drivers of e-service quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of e-service quality and operational practices without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While an insightful body of knowledge \u2013 based primarily on studies at the process-level \u2013 exists on the management of capacity and inventory, the dynamism characterizing most operating and competitive systems poses an ongoing challenge for managers having to mitigate the impact of variability across different levels of operating systems (e.g., production processes, facilities, and supply chains). This paper builds on a conceptual framework, derived from queuing theory and termed the \u201cprocess management triangle\u201d, to explore the extent to which fundamental trade-offs between capacity utilization, variability and inventory (CVI) generalize to complex operations and business systems. To do so, empirical analyses utilizing comparatively unique data for the study of these process management issues \u2013 and collected from two distinct, vastly different levels of analysis \u2013 are presented. First, a simulation-based facility-level analysis using teaching case study data is presented. Second, an industry-level analysis employing archival economic data spanning three multi-year periods is considered. Collectively, these empirical analyses provide exploratory support for the generalization and extension of analytical insights on CVI trade-offs to both complex operations and business systems, although with decreasing explanatory power. The implications of these studies for furthering process management theory and understanding are framed around additional research propositions intended to guide future investigation of CVI trade-offs.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management, specifically on process trade-offs and empirical analyses, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2007","25","5","Craig R.

However, recent quasi-experimental and field research has suggested that the use of this sourcing technique can create perceptions of opportunism among participating suppliers. Yet from the buyer's perspective, online reverse auctions can yield lower purchase prices. Given the many ways in which to configure on-line auctions, we extend existing research by using a laboratory experiment to investigate how different reverse auction configurations jointly influence bid price and suppliers\u2019 perceptions of buyer opportunism.\n            \n            Our findings suggest that supplier bid prices decrease over time as they participate in more eRAs, regardless of the configuration of auction parameters. However, the combination of rank (versus price) visibility, high (versus low) supplier need to win a contract, and six (versus three) competitors was significantly more effective than other combinations of variables in immediately reducing bid prices. The data also indicated that when suppliers\u2019 bids dropped substantially across auctions, their perceptions of opportunism increased. Notably, auction parameter combinations such as price visibility, three competitors, and low need for the contract yielded comparably low bids by the third auction, without any increases in perceived buyer opportunism.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.005","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of electronic reverse auctions and their impact on pricing and supplier perceptions without addressing any social justice, ethical, or DEI themes.

However, the immediate costs of customer queues are primarily psychological, with subsequent costs being customer dissatisfaction and reduced future sales. A fundamental element of psychological waiting costs is wait-perception bias, which is the propensity to overestimate (or underestimate) the passage of time spent waiting. In 1985, Maister proposed a number of principles that affect wait-perception bias [Maister, D., 1985. The psychology of waiting lines. In: Czepiel, J., Solomon, M., Surprenant, C. (Eds.), The Service Encounter. Lexington Books, Lexington, MA, pp. 113\u2013123]. Maister's principles have been frequently quoted in operations management literature, but they have rarely been put to empirical test. One challenge in trying to test these principles is that traditional empirical methods can make it very difficult to accurately represent specific waiting conditions while controlling for confounding factors.\n            \n            This article describes a video-based data collection methodology for studying wait-perception bias. We specifically look at Maister's principle about the impact of wait explanation on wait-perception bias. Results show that there is a significant difference in wait-perception bias due to the presence or absence of an explanation, but that whether the explanation focuses on customer cause or server cause makes little difference. The findings provide needed empirical support for one of Maister's principles, with additional contribution being the development of a video-based research methodology that is able to enrich queuing research by enabling the study of wait-perception bias.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for studying wait-perception bias without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, adoption of eBusiness in supply chains has been slower than expected, particularly in small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper reports findings of a longitudinal study of four supply chains in different sectors over a 4-year period. Specifically it examines the barriers to adoption of eBusiness technologies and therefore to achievement of integrated information in supply chains. Differences between firms in supply chains and between supply chains are examined. The study reveals disparity between existing and planned use of eBusiness by larger downstream firms compared to upstream SMEs. The SMEs are cautious, only planning to invest in eBusiness if dominant downstream customers force them; however, they do not appreciate the full benefits to be gained from eBusiness adoption. The downstream larger businesses are forging ahead with eBusiness in \u2018eIsolation\u2019 and are not providing supply chain leadership. They are creating eLands with SMEs adrift of them.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.004","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['supply chain', 'SMEs', 'eBusiness', 'disparity']","The article discusses the barriers faced by SMEs in adopting eBusiness technologies, highlighting disparities in supply chain integration.

Using a combination of case studies and survey data from a diverse sample of industries, the research examines how industry context, firm characteristics and firm-level strategic resources, such as purchasing teams, influence the exploitation of e-business technologies and the relationship between e-business technology use and firm performance. Based on a synthesis of related literatures from transaction cost economics and the relational view of the supply chain, a two-dimensional framework for e-business technology is proposed with transactional and relational dimensions. However, empirical analysis indicated that transactional technologies can be further subdivided into two factors: dyadic cooperation and price determination. Significant differences were found between the two dimensions in terms of their overall levels of adoption, with dyadic coordination being the most widely adopted. In addition, the development of strategic resources expanded, in particular internal and customer teams, the use of e-business technologies expanded. Purchasing organizational structure and firm size also were positively related to the adoption of transactional e-business technologies. Finally, of particular importance to practitioners, e-business technologies targeted at reducing dyadic coordination costs lead to improved financial performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.005","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['diverse', 'firm characteristics', 'strategic resources']","The article discusses the influence of firm characteristics and teams on e-business technology use, which includes a mention of a 'diverse sample of industries.'

The relationships proposed and tested in the model are justified and explained based on a number of theoretical perspectives. These include Transaction Cost Economics, Socio-technical Systems, Resource Dependency, Knowledge Based View, Stakeholder Theory and Organizational Learning. The implications of the findings for Transaction Cost Theory are noteworthy firstly because they support the appropriateness of the inter-organizational governance structure in the context of this study, and secondly because although application of these technologies may reduce information search and related costs, whether this necessarily leads to reduced coordination costs is problematic. The potential benefits from improved coordination may be constrained by the perceived costs, and risks, of transition to new structural forms. The implication for practice is that increased use of Internet technologies creates substantial pressure to invest in organizational change. The attractiveness of investing in technologies that place managers in a position where they need to promote organizational change in order to extract adequate returns creates a significant dilemma. On the one hand Internet technologies enable extensive sharing and integration of data among trading partners, but at the same time they create conditions requiring managers to embrace fundamental organizational change in order to leverage the potential of such integration.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.006","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['collaboration', 'organizational change', 'stakeholder theory']","The article discusses the need for organizational change and collaboration with trading partners, but it primarily focuses on technical and economic aspects rather than social justice or equity themes.

But little is known about the infrastructural competencies required for manufacturers engaged in Internet-enabled activities with downstream business customers. This paper aims to take a first step in operationalizing a set of new, multi-item measures that tap into infrastructural (or \u201csoft\u201d) competencies required for leveraging B2B commerce.\n            \n            We use a structured, two-stage approach to develop and refine a set of constructs, items, and new multi-item measurement scales in order to rigorously evaluate their measurement properties. By drawing upon the literature as well as extensive interviews with expert practitioners, we define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies \u2013 termed B2B seller competence (B2B-SC) \u2013 associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. We find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) change disposition, (3) conflict management, (4) market acuity, (5) coordinated logistics, (6) knowledge channels, and (7) fluid partnering. Operational indicators that tap into constructs pertaining to each B2B-SC dimension are developed through an iterative process.\n            \n            In the second stage, we conduct a field study to more fully assess the measurement properties of item and scale reliability and validity using a covariance structure framework.

Our model differs from past studies in that collaboration is viewed as two unique constructs, differentiating between intra- and inter-organizational collaboration. Our findings show that use of e-business technologies impacts performance both directly and indirectly by promoting both measures of collaboration. Intra-firm collaboration is also found to have a direct impact on organizational performance. However, the impact of inter-organizational collaboration on performance is found to be only indirect, through the impact of intra-organizational collaboration.

Take-back laws require that firms take responsibility for the collection/disposal costs of their products. We consider two alternative implementations of take-back laws that are distinguished by the degree of control that the manufacturer has on returns sold to the remanufacturer. In one implementation, known as collective WEEE take-back, the manufacturer has no control over returns sold to the remanufacturer. The other implementation, known as individual WEEE take-back, gives complete control to the manufacturer.\n            \n            We develop a general two-period model to investigate questions of interest to policy-makers in government and managers in industry. Our results suggest that, in some settings, enactment of collective WEEE take-back will result in higher manufacturer and remanufacturer profits while simultaneously spurring remanufacturing activity and reducing the tax burden on society. A negative effect is higher consumer prices in the market. In other settings, we find that collective WEEE take-back introduces a structural change to the industry\u2014creating an environment where remanufacturing becomes profitable when it is not profitable without a take-back law. With respect to individual WEEE take-back, we find that the manufacturer often benefits from allowing the remanufacturer to enter the market, though from a government policy-maker perspective, there are clear risks of monopolistic behavior.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.014","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['take-back laws', 'responsibility', 'remanufacturing', 'society']","The article discusses take-back laws that require manufacturers to take responsibility for product disposal, which aligns with themes of sustainability and social responsibility.

The RSC can potentially reduce negative environmental impacts of extracting virgin raw materials and waste disposal. If so, investment in the reverse supply chain should not be made in isolation, but instead must be integrated with investments selected to improve the forward supply chain. After defining and operationalizing these constructs, a survey of plant managers was used to empirically assess the linkages between supply chain investments, organizational risk propensity (i.e., willingness to take risk) and business uncertainty. Reverse supply chain investment had two primary dimensions: reconditioning (i.e., high-value recovery) and recycling and waste management (i.e., low- or no-value recovery). Ongoing investment in the forward supply chain was significantly related to investment in recycling and waste management, but not to investment in reconditioning. Moreover, risk propensity was found to mediate the relationship between the external business uncertainty and investment in the forward and reverse supply chain.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.015","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['environmental impacts', 'recycling', 'waste management']","The article discusses the environmental implications of reverse supply chains, emphasizing sustainability and waste management, which aligns with moderate woke themes.

We consider a durable end-of-life product from which a particular part can be dismantled and remanufactured, and the remainder of the product can be further processed for part and/or material recovery. Both the quantity of end-of-life products available and the demand for remanufactured parts are price-sensitive. We develop models to determine the optimal acquisition price of the end-of-life products and the selling price of the remanufactured parts in centralized as well as remanufacturer- and collector-driven decentralized channels. We discuss how the decentralized channels can be coordinated to attain the end-of-life product collection rate that can be achieved in the centralized channel. In the presence of environmental regulations that require an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of durable goods to collect and process its end-of-life products, we identify when and why the OEM would prefer a remanufacturer- or a collector-driven channel, i.e., outsource the processing or the collection activity, respectively. From a practical perspective, we show that the OEM should prefer a collector-driven channel to increase the collection rate, when end-of-life products are homogenous. However, we also show that the OEM would prefer a remanufacturer-driven channel under certain conditions. We also examine how the OEM can increase the quantity of used products collected, when the collection rate in the preferred channel setting falls short of the collection rate mandated by the environmental regulation. When end-of-life products are heterogeneous, we observe that the collection rate for all quality groups can be positive in a remanufacturer-driven channel, whereas the collection rate for some quality groups may be zero. This indicates that the OEM must pay more attention to its outsourcing decision in this case, if the environmental regulation in effect specifies target collection rates for individual quality groups.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.017","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['environmental regulations', 'end-of-life products', 'sustainability']","The article discusses environmental regulations and the processing of end-of-life products, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability themes.

These regulations significantly influence the distribution process of retail chain organizations. This paper studies the impact of governmental time-window pressure on retailers\u2019 logistical concepts and the consequential financial and environmental distribution performance. We determine which dimensions in the retailer's logistical concept determine its cost and emission sensitivity to increasing time-window pressure. Our research is based on a multiple case study of fourteen Dutch retail cases in different sectors and with different store formulas. The retailers provided all organizational, flow and cost data of their secondary distribution (between distribution center and stores). We use these data to calculate the impacts of different time-window pressure scenarios, including the current situation, using vehicle routing software. It appears that cost and emissions increases are moderate, when few cities are affected. However, as more cities are affected, costs and emissions increase considerably, particularly if time-window lengths become shorter. Time-windows harmonized between cities lead to fewer negative effects. We find various dimensions that contribute to reducing a retailer's sensitivity to time-window pressure. We formulate conclusions hypothesizing the links between time-window pressure, its effects, and the dimensions that determine these effects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.020","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['sustainability', 'social', 'environmental', 'policies']","The article discusses the impact of local sustainability policies on retail operations, emphasizing social sustainability and environmental performance.

To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in \u201cnew\u201d or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.021","short communication","JOM","Operations Management","5","['sustainable', 'environmental', 'responsibility', 'reuse', 'remanufacture']","The article discusses sustainability and environmental responsibility in the context of supply chain management, which aligns with moderate woke themes.

Specifically, this model explains how top management mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on the degree of usage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.  The hypotheses were tested using survey data from companies that have already implemented ERP systems.  Results from partial least squares analyses suggest that mimetic pressures positively affect top management beliefs, which then positively affects top management participation in the ERP assimilation process.  In turn, top management participation is confirmed to positively affect the degree of ERP usage.  Results also suggest that coercive pressures positively affect top management participation without the mediation of top management beliefs.  Surprisingly, we do not find support for our hypothesis that top management participation mediates the effect of normative pressures on ERP usage, but instead we find that normative pressures directly affect ERP usage.  Our findings highlight the important role of top management in mediating the effect of institutional pressures on IT assimilation.  We confirm that institutional pressures, which are known to be important for IT adoption and implementation, also contribute to post-implementation assimilation when the integration processes are prolonged and outcomes are dynamic and uncertain.\n\nThis paper is a recipient of one of  the 2011 Emerald Management Reviews Citations of Excellence Awards.","https://misq.umn.edu/assimilation-of-enterprise-systems-the-effect-of-institutional-pressures-and-the-mediating-role-of-top-management.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['institutional pressures', 'top management', 'ERP usage']","The article discusses institutional pressures and the role of top management in the assimilation of enterprise systems, which hints at organizational dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

RAs have the potential to support and improve the quality of the decisions consumers make when searching for and selecting products online.  They can reduce the information overload facing consumers, as well as the complexity of online searches.  Prior research on RAs has focused mostly on developing and evaluating different underlying algorithms that generate recommendations.  This paper instead identifies other important aspects of RAs, namely RA use, RA characteristics, provider credibility, and factors related to product, user, and user\u2013RA interaction, which influence users\u2019 decision-making processes and outcomes, as well as their evaluation of RAs.

Data were collected in sales divisions at two large corporations in the information technology industry.  We compared multiple media use within and between the two sales divisions, and identified similarities and differences in repertoires.  Our findings suggest that use of repertoires is influenced by institutional conditions (e.g., incentives, trust, and physical proximity) and situational conditions (e.g., urgency, task, etc.), and by routine use of the media over time.

In this article, we propose a strategy for developing information infrastructures in general and in particular for the health care sector in developing countries.  We use complexity science to explain the challenges that need to be addressed, in particular the need for standards that can adapt to a changing health care environment, and propose the concept of flexible standards as a key element in a sustainable infrastructure development strategy.  Drawing on case material from a number of developing countries, a case is built around the use of flexible standards as attractors, arguing that if they are well defined and simple, they will be able to adapt to the frequent changes that are experienced in the complex health environment.  A number of paradoxes are highlighted as useful strategies, integrated independence being one that encourages experimentation and heterogeneity to develop and share innovative solutions while still conforming to simple standards.  The article provides theoretical concepts to support standardization processes in complex systems, and to suggest an approach to implement health standards in developing country settings that is sensitive to the local context, allows change to occur through small steps, and provides a mechanism for scaling information systems.","https://misq.umn.edu/developing-health-information-systems-in-developing-countries-the-flexible-standards-strategy.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['developing countries', 'health care', 'sustainable infrastructure', 'local context', 'innovation']","The article addresses the development of health information systems in developing countries, emphasizing sustainability and local context, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social equity and ethical considerations in technology deployment.

When an information system is used to advance socio-economic development in less developed countries (LDCs), there are additional sources contributing to this multiplicity.  In the case of land management applications, it is important to consider the knowledge that communities have of the land they inhabit.  This paper stresses the importance of constructing knowledge alliances between these multiple knowledge systems in order to support more effective IS development and implementation.  The term knowledge alliance refers not merely to the material characteristics of the knowledge inscribed in technology, but also to the indigenous knowledge of the various communities involved.  This includes the social setting that has shaped the practices which are responsible for the communities\u2019 production, articulation, and use of knowledge.  Two key theoretical concepts, namely boundary objects and participation, are drawn upon both to understand the multiplicity of knowledge systems and to suggest possible approaches to the creation of effective knowledge alliances.

Two hypotheses related to these approaches are developed and tested based on matched survey data collected from the CEOs and CIOs of 110 firms.  The results indicate that the resource-centered and contingency-based approaches provide complementary understanding of the strategic value of IT.  On the one hand, the contingency-based approach is better at explaining the impact of cost-related IT applications on firm performance.  Alignment between business strategy and information systems strategy on cost reduction was found to have a significant negative association with firm expense.  On the other hand, the resource-centered perspective has a stronger predictive ability of IT impact on firm revenue and profitability.  Our results indicate that investments in growth-oriented applications were directly and positively related to firm revenue.  An ANOVA test indicates that the nonlinear approaches provide additional insights that help to better understand the relationship between alignment and performance.  The response surface method (RSM) shows that high-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both high) leads to superior performance compared to low-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both low).

Its mission has been to empower managers, IS engineers, and information and communication technology users with knowledge and techniques for effective decision making.  However, empirical research frequently encounters human activity that is at odds with the assumed pattern of rational behavior.  Recent work tries to explain behavior in IS and organizational change in terms of social processes rather than as a consideration of rational techniques of professional practice.  In this paper we address this ambivalence of the IS field with regard to technical/rational knowledge and practice.  We draw from the theoretical work of Michel Foucault on power/knowledge and the aesthetics of existence to argue that the rational techniques of IS practice and the power dynamics of an organization and its social context are closely intertwined, requiring each other to be sustained.  Furthermore, we develop a context-specific notion of rationality in IS innovation, through which interested parties judge the value of an innovation for their lives and consequently support or subvert its course.

The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health.  The purpose of the system was to improve health conditions by extending science-based medicine into a region with well-established traditional healing practices.  The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices.  The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel\u2019s activity, the local population\u2019s conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery.  The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics.  In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers, and patients in the districts whether or not they were involved in the telemedicine project.  New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients.  Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers. \n\nAn argument is made that people\u2019s construction of their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects.

In this study, we draw on the task complexity literature to develop a broad and holistic model that examines the antecedents and consequences of PWC. Our results provide two important insights into the relationship between PWC and user outcomes. First, the positive relationship between objective complexity and PWC was moderated by user familiarity. Second, online task goals (goal-directed search and experiential browsing) moderated the relationship between PWC and user satisfaction.

Some of these changes are incremental, but many require fundamental shifts in mindset (referred to as a mindshift).  Within the domain of software development, previous research has determined that veteran developers experience difficulty making the transition to new forms of development.  Although prior research has brought awareness to the problems caused by a mindshift and has provided some insight, it has not answered the question of why software developers have difficulty making the transition. This study begins to answer that question by positing and examining the mindshift learning theory (MLT). The MLT suggests that the degree of perceived novelty of the fundamental concepts that characterize the new mindset will impact learning.  Specifically, concepts may be perceived as novel (i.e., not familiar to the learner), changed (i.e., similar to a known concept, but a different meaning in the new context), or carryover (i.e., known concept with a similar meaning in the new context).  As an exemplar mindshift learning situation, this study explores the phenomenon in the context of software developers transitioning from traditional to object-oriented (OO) software development.  Findings indicate that software developers had higher knowledge scores on the OO concepts they perceived as novel or carryover compared to those they perceived as changed.  Thus, developers experienced detrimental interference from their existing traditional software development knowledge structure when trying to learn OO software development. The findings have implications for organizations and individuals as an understanding of mindshifts could mean an easier transition through decreased frustration and a more effective learning process.","https://misq.umn.edu/understanding-mindshift-learning-the-transition-to-object-oriented-development.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['mindshift', 'learning', 'transition']","The article discusses the concept of 'mindshift' in the context of software development, which indicates a focus on learning and adaptation rather than traditional profit metrics.

While plausible in the case of initial IS adoption, this assumption may not be as readily applicable to continued IS usage behavior since it ignores that frequently performed behaviors tend to become habitual and thus automatic over time.  \n\nThis paper is a step forward in defining and incorporating the \u201chabit\u201d construct into IS research.  Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of habit and its antecedents in the context of continued IS usage.\n\nBuilding on previous work in other disciplines, we define habit in the context of IS usage as the extent to which people tend to perform behaviors (use IS) automatically because of learning.  Using recent work on the continued usage of IS (IS continuance), we have developed a model suggesting that continued IS usage is not only a consequence of intention, but also of habit.  In particular, in our research model, we propose IS habit to moderate the influence of intention such that its importance in determining behavior decreases as the behavior in question takes on a more habitual nature.  Integrating past research on habit and IS continuance further, we suggest how antecedents of behavior/behavioral intention as identified by IS continuance research relate to drivers of habitualization.\n\nWe empirically tested the model in the context of voluntary continued WWW usage.  Our results support the argument that habit acts as a moderating variable of the relationship between intentions and IS continuance behavior, which may put a boundary condition on the explanatory power of intentions in the context of continued IS usage.  The data also support that satisfaction, frequency of past behavior, and comprehensiveness of usage are key to habit formation and thus relevant in the context of IS continuance behavior.

Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team members played an important role in forming expertise location and cognition-based trust.  Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less important.

It is particularly challenging in institutionalized settings such as hospitals.  We report an interpretive field study of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) at an acute-care hospital, in which we investigated how institutionally triggered and technology-triggered change interacted in complementary processes to engender alignment.  Social structure changes included increased interdependency among clinical departments, multidisciplinary cooperation across clinical disciplines, and standardization in clinical decision-making.  Organization members also enacted institutionalized interaction patterns with physicians by deferring to their preferences for CPOE use.  The cumulative influence of change triggers nonetheless facilitated the hospital\u2019s realization of clinical goals.  We drew on Barley\u2019s (1990) role- and network-based model for technology and structure alignment.  Nonetheless, we extended this micro-level analytic approach to account for the influence of change in the macro-institutional environment.

However, the growth of Internet auctions has been accompanied by a corresponding growth in Internet auction fraud.  Much extant research on Internet auction fraud in the information systems literature is conducted at the individual level of analysis, thereby limiting its focus to the choices of individual traders or trading dyads.  The criminology literature, in contrast, recognizes that social and community factors are equally important influences on the perpetration and prevention of crime.  We employ social disorganization theory as a lens to explain how online auction communities address auction fraud and how those communities interact with formal authorities.  We show how communities may defy, coexist, or cooperate with the formal authority of auction houses.  These observations are supported by a qualitative analysis of three cases of online anticrime communities operating in different auction product categories.  Our analysis extends aspects of social disorganization theory to online communities.  We conclude that community-based clan control may operate in concert with authority-based formal control to manage the problem of Internet auction fraud more effectively.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-role-of-online-trading-communities-in-managing-internet-auction-fraud.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['community', 'social disorganization', 'authority', 'crime prevention']","The article discusses the role of online communities in addressing auction fraud, emphasizing social factors and community influence, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social responsibility and ethical considerations in business practices."],["2007","31.0","4","Christopher J.

Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level).  Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in practice.  To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such.  The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences.","https://misq.umn.edu/toward-a-deeper-understanding-of-system-usage-in-organizations-a-multilevel-perspective.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['multilevel', 'system usage', 'organizations']","The article focuses on a technical examination of system usage in organizations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper introduces smooth transition regression models to study threshold-based price elasticity of the top 4 brands across 20 fast-moving consumer good categories. Threshold-based price elasticity is found for 76% of all brands: 29% reflect historical benchmark prices, 16% reflect competitive benchmark prices, and 31% reflect both types of benchmarks. The authors demonstrate asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size and the sign and the magnitude of the elasticity difference. Interestingly, they observe latitude of acceptance for gains compared to the historical benchmark, but saturation effects in most other cases. Moreover, category characteristics influence the extent and the nature of threshold-based price elasticity, while individual brand characteristics impact the size of the price thresholds. From a managerial perspective, the paper illustrates the sales, revenue, and margin implications for price changes typically observed in consumer markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0207","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price elasticity in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We analyze a problem in which a manufacturer segments the market on quality attributes and offers products that are partial substitutes. Because consumers self-select from the product line, product cannibalization is an issue. In addition, the manufacturer sets a production schedule in order to balance production setups with accumulation of inventories in the presence of economies of scale. We show that simultaneous optimization of the product line design and production schedule leads to insights that differ significantly from the common intuition and assertions in the literature, which omits either the demand side or the supply side of the equation. In particular, we demonstrate that more expensive production technology always leads to lower product prices and may at the same time lead to higher quality products. Further, a less efficient production technology does not necessarily increase total production costs or reduce consumer welfare. We also demonstrate that in the presence of production technology, the demand cannibalization problem may distort product quality upward or the number of products upward, which is contrary to the standard result.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0216","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product line design and production technology without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that such a policy creates opportunities for multiple selling in a capacity-constrained service\u2014i.e., collecting cancellation fees from advance buyers who cancel, and then reselling the freed slots. The better the alternative that motivates a cancellation, the more profitable is a refund-for-cancellations policy compared with a no-refund policy that \u201clocks in\u201d customers. In contrast to previous research on money-back guarantees for durable goods, we show that offering refunds for service cancellations can be profitable (1) without charging a higher price compared with a no-refund policy, and (2) even when advance buyers would be willing to abandon the service for no refund. Also, service providers should decrease rather than increase the customer hassle cost of cancellations. Our research also suggests a new profit advantage of advance selling, i.e., capturing some of the consumer-added surplus created when customers find new alternatives (and are therefore willing to pay a fee to terminate the prepurchased contract). Finally, yield-management research typically assumes exogenous \u201cno shows\u201d by advance buyers. We suggest that offering refunds for cancellation reduces the need to reserve capacity for high-paying customers and improves capacity utilization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0220","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on profit strategies related to customer cancellations without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

This paper examines the competitive implications of asymmetric customer loyalty in such markets. In traditional markets, an advantage in customer loyalty generates a profit advantage. We show here, however, that in the presence of a cross-market network effect, a midlevel of loyalty advantage in the primary product market can lead to an overall profit disadvantage. This surprising result is derived from the interdependence of the two markets, whereby a profit in one market may be gained at the cost of the other, and by the positive relationship between a larger loyalty segment and a higher opportunity cost of price competition in the product of the primary market. Extending our model to a two-period entry game also shows that under certain conditions, the entrant with disadvantage in customer loyalty can outperform the incumbent in profit and market share.

To increase real wages (i.e., the ability to buy more), economic principles prescribe increasing productivity (i.e., greater output from less input). In contrast, marketing principles prescribes increasing the value of output (i.e., greater customer benefits) through innovation. Beyond increasing real wages, innovation spawns new occupations better matching individuals with skills and providing greater nonmonetary benefits (i.e., job satisfaction). Unfortunately, threatened entrenched incumbents often solicit protectionist legislation claiming negative externalities (e.g., short-term unemployment, lower wages, and burdens on society). Innovation does require labor to move from inferior to superior organizations (i.e., unemployment). However, protectionism only delays and dramatically aggravates the inevitable trauma associated with progress, as worker skills, firm practices, and buyer welfare fall further behind.

With needs-based systems, users specify the relative importance of their needs, and an optimization algorithm recommends the combination of design parameters that is likely to maximize user utility.

We quantify the differential wearout effects across the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better manage their scheduling.

However, we find that cultural orientation affects responses to personalized recommendations for only those products whose consumption or choice decision is subject to public scrutiny. We further demonstrate that the favorability of thoughts elicited by ads offering targeted versus personalized offers mediates the effect of cultural orientation on responses to personalization.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model to illustrate a strategic manufacturer response to a dominant retailer. In our model, a dominant and a weak retailer compete for the sale of a single product supplied by a single manufacturer. The dominant retailer has the power to dictate the wholesale price, but the manufacturer sets the wholesale price for the weak retailer. The manufacturer also has partial ability to transfer demand between retailers. In the strategic manufacturer response, the manufacturer begins by raising the wholesale price for the weak retailer over that for the dominant retailer. This makes the weak retailer the high-margin channel. The manufacturer then transfers demand to the weak retailer by engaging in joint promotions and advertising. We then use this strategic response model to derive a testable hypothesis that may guide future research in determining the source of dominant retailers\u2019 low prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0239","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a theoretical model regarding manufacturer responses to retailer dominance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Diamond\u2019s eponym for the Anna Karenina principle (Diamond 1997). The principle suggests that no one property guarantees success but many guarantee failure. The Anna Karenina (TAK) bias is a logical consequence. TAK bias is more insidious than the kindred Survivor bias, which cautions that measured variables for passively observed survivors often differ from easily overlooked nonsurvivors. TAK bias, in contrast, cautions that the observed variables themselves might differ for survivors. The most revealing variables might exhibit negligible variation among survivors because survivors are necessarily alike. Perhaps variability is inversely related to the variable\u2019s importance for survival. TAK bias is more problematic for descriptive research, in contrast to normative (i.e., prescriptive) research, which seeks the true causal variables. Normative research only offers conditional aid to the decision maker on specific variables. To avoid TAK bias, we must not passively let accountants decide which variables we observe.

This two-segment structure with asymmetric influence is consistent with several theories in sociology and diffusion research, as well as many \u201cviral\u201d or \u201cnetwork\u201d marketing strategies. We have four main results. (1) Diffusion in a mixture of influentials and imitators can exhibit a dip or \u201cchasm\u201d between the early and later parts of the diffusion curve. (2) The proportion of adoptions stemming from influentials need not decrease monotonically, but may first decrease and then increase. (3) Erroneously specifying a mixed-influence model to a mixture process where influentials act independently from each other can generate systematic changes in the parameter values reported in earlier research. (4) Empirical analysis of 33 different data series indicates that the two-segment model fits better than the standard mixed-influence, the Gamma/Shifted Gompertz, and the Weibull-Gamma models, especially in cases where a two-segment structure is likely to exist.

The authors illustrate each of these aspects using data on personal-computer preferences. They find that two-thirds of the subjects in the sample use some kind of lexicographic rule. In contrast, only one in five subjects use a standard lexicographic rule. This suggests that lexicographic rules are more widely used by consumers than one might have thought in the absence of the lexicographic variants described in the paper.

In particular, a greater proportion of firms than is typical report earnings higher than normal and marketing expenditures lower than normal at the time of their SEO. Although they realize that firms might be undertaking strategies to artificially inflate current-term earnings, the financial markets are not adequately identifying and properly valuing the firms doing so. Our results indicate that myopic firms are able to temporarily inflate their stock market valuation, but in the long run, as the consequences of cutting marketing spending become manifest, they have inferior stock market performance.

The literature shows that mean-centering can reduce the covariance between the linear and the interaction terms, thereby suggesting that it reduces collinearity. We analytically prove that mean-centering neither changes the computational precision of parameters, the sampling accuracy of main effects, simple effects, interaction effects, nor the R2. We also show that the determinants of the cross product matrix X\u2032 X are identical for uncentered and mean-centered data, so the collinearity problem in the moderated regression is unchanged by mean-centering. Many empirical marketing researchers commonly mean-center their moderated regression data hoping that this will improve the precision of estimates from ill conditioned, collinear data, but unfortunately, this hope is futile. Therefore, researchers using moderated regression models should not mean-center in a specious attempt to mitigate collinearity between the linear and the interaction terms.

When successful, they can expect to continue executing on an established marketing strategy. However, when the results are disappointing, a change or turnaround strategy may be called for to help performance get back on track. In such cases, performance diagnostics are needed to identify turnarounds and to quantify the role of marketing policy shifts in this process. This paper proposes a framework for such a diagnosis and applies several methods to provide converging evidence for two main findings. First, contrary to prevailing beliefs, the performance of brands in mature markets is not always stable. Instead, brands systematically improve or deteriorate their performance outlook in clearly identifiable time windows that are relatively short compared to windows of stability. Second, these shifts in performance regimes are associated with the brand\u2019s marketing actions and policy shifts, as opposed to competitive marketing. Promotion-oriented marketing policy shifts are particularly potent in improving a brand\u2019s performance outlook.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0267","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on marketing performance and strategy without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We used this analysis to identify the least effective promotions and conducted a controlled field test to demonstrate the impact of eliminating them before chainwide implementation. Our key findings are as follows. First, approximately 45% of the gross lift from promotions is incremental for CVS. Further, for every unit of gross lift, 0.16 unit of some other product is purchased elsewhere in the store. Still, more than 50% of promotions are not profitable because the lower promotional margin is not sufficiently offset by incremental units. Second, there is substantial variation in net profit impact across categories. Our field test shows that eliminating promotions chainwide in 15 of the worst performing categories will decrease sales by about $7.8 million but will improve profit by approximately $52.6 million. This is very impressive given that CVS front store sales in 2003 were approximately $9 billion while the net profit impact of promotions was \u2212$25.3 million.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0245","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on quantifying promotional effectiveness and profit impacts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such an attribute combination implies that the claimed level of a product attribute is then different from what the consumer might infer, given the level of another attribute, resulting in what we call product incoherence. We develop a model to calibrate the effect of incoherence on perceptions, uncertainty, preference, and ultimately purchase. Our model can allow managers to determine consumers\u2019 acceptance for different positions in the multiattribute space, so they can optimize their product\u2019s positioning. Our model implies that a product that combines positively valued attributes might increase some elements of preference for the product, but if those attributes occur in unexpected combinations, incoherence will also increase uncertainty which in turn might lower other elements of preference. The net risk-adjusted preference for a product in our model accommodates both the benefit from the expected attribute levels and the uncertainty associated with incoherence. We derive implications from the model and provide an empirical test that supports those implications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0246","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'preference', 'product attributes']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and product positioning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We characterize EP as a sales promotion strategy and juxtapose it with traditional approaches, such as discounts and rebates. Across three experiments, using a nationwide Internet panel and employing stated measures and model-based inference, we find that at low denominations EP is more effective than an equivalent price discount. We describe how an EP\u2019s social association may influence consumer choice quite differently than price promotions and, contrary to the asymmetric price promotion effect documented in the promotions literature, we find that EP benefits an unknown brand more than a known brand. Our hierarchical Bayes approach uncovers heterogeneity in EP effectiveness that can be explained by affinity toward the focal charity, personal motivations, and demographic markers. An identifiable segment of individuals prefer the \u201cother\u201d over \u201cself,\u201d suggesting possible EP optimization and segmentation strategies.

The CELM technology combines advanced models of Markov decision processes (MDPs), Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio optimization. MDPs are used to model customer dynamics and to find optimal marketing policies that maximize the value generated by a customer over a given time horizon. Lifetime value optimization is achieved through dynamic programming algorithms that identify which marketing actions, such as cross-selling, up-selling, and loyalty marketing campaigns, transition customers to better value and loyalty states. The CELM technology can also be used to simulate the financial impact of a given marketing policy using Monte Carlo simulation. This allows marketing managers to simulate several targeting scenarios to assess budget requirements and the expected impact of a given marketing policy. The benefits of the solution are illustrated with the Finnair case study, where CELM has been used to optimize marketing planning and budgeting for Finnair\u2019s frequent-flyer program (FFP).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0249","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing management and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Intuitively, free riding should hurt the retailer that provides that service, but the author shows analytically that free riding benefits not only the free-riding retailer, but also the retailer that provides the service when customers are heterogeneous in terms of their opportunity costs for shopping. The service-providing retailer has a postservice advantage, because customers who have resolved their matching uncertainty through sales service incur zero marginal shopping cost if they purchase from the service-providing retailer rather than the free-riding retailer. Moreover, allowing free riding gives the free rider less incentive to compete with the service provider on price, because many customers eventually will switch to it due to their own free riding. In turn, this induced soft strategic response enables the service provider to charge a higher price and enjoy the strictly positive profit that otherwise would have been wiped away by head-to-head price competition. Therefore, allowing free riding can be regarded as a necessary mechanism that prevents an aggressive response from another retailer and reduces the intensity of price competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0252","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of competition and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, brands that offer a greater variety of options that appear compatible and require similar skills tend to be perceived as having greater category expertise or core competency in the category, which, in turn, enhances their perceived quality and purchase likelihood. Six studies support this proposition and demonstrate that compared to brands which offer fewer products, (a) brands which offer increased compatible variety are perceived as having higher quality; (b) this effect is mediated by product variety\u2019s impact on perceived expertise; (c) the higher perceived quality produces a greater choice share of the higher variety brand, even among consumers who select options that multiple brands offer and (d) product variety also impacts post-experience perceptions of taste.

We posit that if the provided information has an affective System 1 element, then the affective reaction serves as an input to the System 2 process of information integration. Such an affective input has the potential to cause improper information integration resulting in a biased mental representation, which in turn leads to suboptimal choices. Across three experiments, we test the interfering role of affect in information integration. Experiment 1 establishes the mediating role of the affective System 1 generating a preference for the suboptimal option and rules out the alternate account of analytical skills. Experiments 2 and 3 provide converging evidence for the proposed account that System 1 interferes with System 2 and argue against the alternate account of System 1 directly influencing choice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0278","","MKS","Marketing","2","['bias', 'decision-making', 'affective']","The article discusses biases in decision-making processes, which touches on ethical considerations but does not emphasize social justice or progressive themes.

In the past, the majority of such auctions have been solely price based, but increasingly attributes other than price affect the auction outcome. Specifically, the buyer uses a scoring function to compare bids and the bid with the highest score wins. We investigate two mechanisms commonly used for procurement in business-to-business markets, in a setting in which buyers' welfare is affected by exogenous nonprice attributes such as the quality, service, and past relationships. Under both mechanisms, bidders bid based on price, but in the \u201cbuyer-determined\u201d mechanism, the buyer is free to select the bid that maximizes her surplus while in the \u201cprice-based\u201d mechanism, the buyer commits to awarding the contract to the low price bidder. We find, both in theory and in the laboratory, that the \u201cbuyer-determined\u201d mechanism increases the buyer's welfare only as long as enough suppliers compete. If the number of suppliers is small and the correlation between cost and quality is low, the buyer is better off with the \u201cprice-based\u201d mechanism.

Consumer Behavior Under Three-Part Tariffs","In communication, information, and other industries, three-part tariffs are increasingly popular. A three-part tariff is defined by an access price, an allowance, and a marginal price for any usage in excess of the allowance. Empirical nonlinear pricing studies have focused on consumer choice under two-part tariffs. We show that consumer behavior differs under three-part tariffs and assess how consumer demand uncertainty impacts tariff choice. We develop a discrete/continuous model of choice among three-part tariffs and estimate it using consumer-level data on Internet usage. Our model extends prior work in accommodating consumer switching to competitors, thereby capturing behavior in competitive industries more accurately. Our empirical work shows that demand uncertainty is a key driver of choice among three-part tariffs. Consumers' expected bill increases with the variation in their usage, steering them toward tariffs with high allowances. Consequently, demand uncertainty decreases consumer surplus and increases provider revenue. A further analysis of consumers' responsiveness to the different elements of a three-part tariff under the provider's current pricing structure reveals that prices affect a consumer's tariff choice more than her usage quantity and that the allowance plays a strong role in consumer tariff choice. Based on our results, we derive implications for pricing with three-part tariffs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0283","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The editorial ends by discussing citation metrics, appointments to the editorial board and copyrights. This article argues that (1) requesting more reviews yields a faster, more informative review process; (2) publishing more articles can raise citations per article; (3) for many submissions, some reviewers should evaluate procedures, whereas others should evaluate contribution; (4) reviewers should not micromanage revisions; (5) editors must, unfortunately, write overly cautious decision letters; and (6) it is important to reward reviewers with board appointments and published acknowledgments.

Besanko et al. (2005) model a target brand's retail price as a function of its own and other brands' wholesale prices using 780 observations (15 price zones \u00d7 52 weeks) and take the many significant coefficients for other brands' wholesale prices that they find as evidence of cross-brand pass-through. Because price zones do not react independently to wholesale prices when they set a brand's retail price, Besanko et al.'s (2005) estimation overstates the number of independent observations by a factor of 15. When we correct for this overstatement of independent observations, we find that the number of stable, significant coefficients for other brands' wholesale prices is lower than one would expect by chance. We conclude that there is no evidence of cross-brand pass-through in the 11 categories analyzed by Besanko et al.

For example, many managerial decisions are driven by whether or not a feature is valued more than the price the consumer will be asked to pay. In other cases, some managerial decisions are weighed more heavily than others. The standard measures used to evaluate experimental designs (e.g., A-efficiency or D-efficiency) do not accommodate these phenomena. We propose alternative \u201cmanagerial efficiency\u201d criteria (M-errors) that are relatively easy to implement. We explore their properties, suggest practical algorithms to decrease errors, and provide illustrative examples. Realistic examples suggest improvements of as much as 30% in managerial efficiency.

A novel contractual device, which I term as a Free New Version Rights warranty (free NVR warranty), can help the seller overcome this temptation. In a two-period game-theoretic model involving a monopolist firm facing heterogeneous consumers, I derive conditions under which a rational monopolist can act suboptimally: She could face a commitment problem and offer the new version, even if doing so lowers her overall profit. Profit is hurt because when consumers expect a new version, (a) fewer consumers buy the initial version, and (b) the monopolist is forced to charge a lower price for the initial version. I show how the free NVR warranty, which requires the monopolist to offer consumers the right to receive the new version for free for a limited period, can solve her commitment problem. This is a new, surprising finding: By bundling new-version rights with the initial version, the monopolist at first appears to be denying herself future revenue. I derive conditions under which this apparently unprofitable action is optimal, which is my main contribution. When free NVR is offered, consumer surplus decreases and social surplus increases. This work extends prior literature on durable goods and the Coase conjecture to innovative durable goods with network externalities. The findings have important practical implications for firms selling new versions of innovative durable goods subject to network effects, as well as for their consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0289","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of monopolistic behavior and profit optimization without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The relationships between profits and product differentiation reveal that both McDonald's and Burger King are better off avoiding close competition if the market area is large enough. However, in small market areas, McDonald's would prefer to be located together with Burger King rather than have the two outlets be only a slight distance apart. In contrast, Burger King's profits always increase with greater differentiation. Offsetting these incentives is the desirability of locating centrally to appeal to the most customers. The equilibrium depends on the market's size. In small markets, McDonald's locates near the center of the market, and Burger King locates to the side of the market. In larger markets, McDonald's and Burger King choose locations on opposite sides of the market, although McDonald's locates closer to the optimal central location than Burger King.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0296","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on product positioning and competition strategies in the fast food industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our results suggest that smokers' participation and cessation decisions are governed by the interplay between three effects. The cessation effect leads smokers to advance their plans to quit smoking, whereas the procrastination effect leads them to consecutively revise their planned quitting age upwards. Consequently, the duration of smoking is effectively governed by which one of these two effects is dominant. Finally, for certain consumer segments, a threshold effect causes an \u201call or nothing\u201d type of extreme smoking behavior based on certain critical values of present-biased preferences. Our results provide some preliminary evidence that both marketing efforts by tobacco firms and public policy initiatives can have a significant influence on smoking behavior. In particular, we find that reductions in the age at which individuals start smoking may not only vastly extend their duration of smoking, but also convert potential \u201cnever smokers\u201d into lifetime smokers. Finally, we estimate a hazard model using survey data from over 800 smokers to provide evidence in support of our theoretical model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0298","","MKS","Marketing","2","['public policy', 'smoking behavior', 'consumer segments']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior related to smoking cessation without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This prediction departs from the often-held view that people who generate more ideas will also generate ideas that are more divergent.

However, in many systems, particularly service and professional work, judgment is frequently required to determine how much time to allocate to a task. In this paper, we show that introducing discretion in task completion adds a fourth variability buffer, quality, to the well-known buffers of capacity, inventory and time. To gain insight into the managerial implications of this difference, we model the work of one- and two-worker systems with discretionary task completion as controlled queues. After characterizing the optimal control policy and identifying some practical heuristics, we use this model to examine the differences between discretionary and nondiscretionary work. We show that in systems with discretionary task completion, (i) adding capacity may actually increase congestion, and (ii) task variability in service time can improve system performance. This implies that it may be suboptimal to expect shorter delays as a result of a capacity increase, and that task variability reduction may not be an appropriate goal in systems with discretionary task completion. We also find that the benefit of queue pooling is smaller in systems with discretionary task completion than in systems with nondiscretionary task completion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0598","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['discretion', 'task completion', 'service work']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and performance evaluation models without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This is especially true for product categories such as automobiles and technology goods where the lead time needed for manufacturing forces firms to make production decisions well in advance of the selling season. Once the firm has produced the goods, the available production volume affects the firm\u2019s subsequent marketing decisions. In this paper, we study the relationship between the firm\u2019s production and marketing decisions for a durable goods manufacturer. We develop a dynamic model of a durable product market in which the demand functions are developed from a micromodeling of consumer utility functions and an equilibrium analysis of consumer strategies. After taking into account the demand uncertainty as well as the potential for cannibalization of future sales, the manufacturer makes its production and sales decisions. We find that the firm\u2019s optimal inventory level is U-shaped in the durability of the product and that the firm suffers a larger loss due to uncertainty when it is leases rather than sells its products. Furthermore, unlike the case for nondurables, for durable goods we find that the effect of uncertainty persists even after the uncertainty has been resolved.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0599","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and marketing decisions without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We study competition between a multiproduct generalist firm and two single-product specialist firms in two product categories, one of which has undifferentiated products and the other has differentiated products. In our model, the specialist firms can form an alliance to bundle their products in competing with the generalist firm. In contrast to the previous literature, we find that concurrent bundling by competitors, if it occurs in equilibrium, is profitable. We also find that when one competitor bundles and the other does not, the bundling firm gains a greater share of customers and makes a higher profit. However, when conditions favor counterbundling by a competitor, such counterbundling helps the competitor retain its customers. Finally, we note that under other market conditions, concurrent bundling by competitors escalates price competition to the extent that retaining customers through bundling is not profitable. In such a case, we show that strategic competitors are better off having asymmetric product lines with one competitor bundling and the other selling unbundled.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0601","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive bundling strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the context of data mining, sensitive information often takes the form of itemsets that need to be suppressed before the data is released. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the number of nonsensitive itemsets lost while concealing sensitive ones. It is shown to be an intractably large version of an NP-hard problem. Consequently, a two-phased procedure that involves the solution of two smaller NP-hard problems is proposed as a practical and effective alternative. In the first phase, a procedure to solve a sanitization problem identifies how the support for sensitive itemsets could be eliminated from a specific transaction by removing the fewest number of items from it. This leads to a modified frequent itemset hiding problem, where transactions to be sanitized are selected such that the number of nonsensitive itemsets lost, while concealing sensitive ones, is minimized. Heuristic procedures are developed for these problems using intuition derived from their integer programming formulations. Results from computational experiments conducted on a publicly available retail data set and three large data sets generated using IBM\u2019s synthetic data generator indicate that these approaches are very effective, solving problems involving up to 10 million transactions in a short period of time. The results also show that the process of sanitization has considerable bearing on the quality of solutions obtained.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0603","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['privacy', 'sensitive information', 'sanitization']","The article discusses the technical aspects of preserving privacy and handling sensitive information, which touches on ethical considerations but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or broader DEI themes.

To this end, we develop and estimate a state-space model based on the Kalman filter that captures the dynamics of brand equity as influenced by its drivers, such as the brand\u2019s advertising and sales promotion expenditures. By integrating the Kalman filter with the random coefficients logit demand model, our estimation allows us to capture the dynamics of brand equity as well as to model consumer heterogeneity using store-level data. Using these demand model estimates, we determine the Markov perfect equilibrium advertising and promotion strategies. Our empirical analysis is based on store-level scanner data in the orange juice category, which comprises two major brands\u2014Tropicana and Minute Maid. As expected, we find that sales promotions have a significant positive effect on consumers\u2019 utility and induce consumers to switch to the promoted brand. However, there is also a negative effect of promotions on brand equity that carries over from period to period. Overall, we find that while sales promotions have a net positive impact both in the short term and in the long term, the implied total profit elasticity including the long-term effect is smaller than the short-term profit elasticity. Correspondingly, we expect myopic decision makers to allocate higher than optimal expenditures to sales promotions. Our results from the supply-side analysis reveal that the actual promotion levels for both brands are indeed higher than the optimal budgets for the forward-looking (long-term orientation) as well as the two-year planning horizon scenarios. Hence, it may be profitable for both brands to reduce their promotion levels. Further, we find that although the forward-looking promotional spending levels are higher for the smaller brand, Minute Maid, it is market leader Tropicana that spends more on sales promotions. Turning to optimal advertising budgets, we find that the equilibrium forward-looking advertising levels are higher for Tropicana, the brand that has higher brand equity and a higher responsiveness to advertising. Further, as expected, the optimal forward-looking advertising levels are higher than the myopic levels and the two-year planning horizon levels for both brands. However, the forward-looking advertising levels are lower than the actual advertising expenditures for both brands. This implies that even when we consider the long-term effects of advertising, the brands are overspending on advertising.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0604","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of advertising budgets and brand equity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We look at n agents selling substitutable products competing in a market. In this setting, we examine models with deterministic and stochastic demand, and we use a two-stage approach. In Stage 1, agents form alliances (coalitions), and in Stage 2, coalitions make decisions (price and inventory) and compete against one another. To analyze the stability of coalition structures in Stage 1, we use two notions from cooperative games\u2014the largest consistent set (LCS) and the equilibrium process of coalition formation (EPCF)\u2014which allow players to be farsighted. Thus, in forming alliances, players consider two key phenomena: First, players trade off the size of the total profit of the system versus their allocation of this total pie, and second, they weigh the possibility that an immediate beneficial defection can trigger further counter defections that in the end may prove to be worse than the status quo. In particular, one such example is that of the grand coalition\u2014which we show to be stable in the farsighted sense\u2014even though players benefit myopically by defecting from it. We also provide conditions under which a situation of a few lone players competing against a large coalition is stable. We examine the impact of the size of the market (n), the degree of competition, the effect of cost parameters, and the variability of the demand process on the prices, inventory levels, and structure of the market. We discuss the possible strategic implications of our results to firms in a competitive market and for new entrants.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0605","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on dynamic alliance formation and competitive market strategies without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

If we order multiple items using an economic order quantity (EOQ) policy, and consolidate shipments, part of the ordering cost is shared, and part is specific to each item; we want to find the consolidation choice with optimal total cost and divide the cost fairly among the individual items. Such a fair division is central to a costing system in which no group of items subsidizes the others; there are no free riders! We use a cooperative inventory game to determine when this can be done. This game is usually not concave, so we want to know what consolidation combinations determine when this cost can be fairly divided, using the core of the game. We prove that consolidation of all the items is cheaper exactly if there are fair cost allocations (core of the game is not empty), which happens when the portion of the ordering cost common to all items is not too small. We further show how sensitive the nonempty core result is to adjustments in the cost parameters and show how to determine a threshold value for the shared ordering cost, which assures the existence of a fair cost allocation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0607","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['fair division', 'cost allocation', 'no free riders']","The article discusses 'fair division' and 'cost allocation,' which touch on themes of equity, but the primary focus remains on technical aspects of cost management rather than social justice or progressive themes.

In converging markets, firms from different industries compete against each other, often for the first time. We propose that firms introducing new products in converging markets will learn vicariously from other firms in the market. Further, we propose that this learning will vary across the dual-technology frontier (DTF), where the high-technology frontier (HTF) and low-technology frontier (LTF) map onto innovative activities driven by technological opportunity and user needs. We propose that at the HTF, local search will dominate and firms will be influenced by HTF product introductions of similarly sized, successful firms. At the LTF, learning will occur across the DTF, vary by origin industry of the firm, and be affected by complementarities in routines and capabilities and market competition among firms. We test the proposed model of vicarious learning using panel data on new product introductions of 67 firms in the U.S. digital camera market in the 1990s. Findings generally support our proposed model of vicarious learning in this market. They show heterogeneity in vicarious learning across the technology frontier and firm characteristics\u2014including the origin industry of target firms. Our results show that vicarious learning in new product introductions in converging markets\u2014which includes both mimetic and nonmimetic learning\u2014is similar in some ways, but different from more traditional markets.

Decisions by firms that considered but did not purchase an option or a license are included in the sample. Consistent with the basic premise of real-options theory, I find that firms are more likely to purchase option contracts for more uncertain technologies. Also in line with theoretical predictions, I find that firms that are better able to evaluate an external technology are less likely to purchase options before licensing. The results also highlight more complex motives for exercising options in technology licensing. On the one hand, firms appear to benefit from their ability to learn about the technology during the option period. On the other hand, firms that are better able to \u201cabsorb\u201d the technology during the contract period may have reduced incentives to subsequently license the invention.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0705","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of technology licensing and decision-making processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Due to market pressures, production must begin soon after the product development effort is complete, which requires that an upstream supplier invests in capacity while the design of the product and production process are in flux. Because the product is ill-defined at this point in time, the firms are unable to write court-enforceable contracts that specify the terms of trade or the supplier's capacity investment. However, the firms can adopt an informal agreement (relational contract) regarding the terms of trade and capacity investment. The potential for future business provides incentive for the firms to adhere to the relational contract. We show that the optimal relational contract may be complex, requiring the buyer to order more than her demand to indirectly monitor the supplier's capacity investment. We propose a simpler relational contract and show that it performs very well for a broad range of parameters.

Thus, it is the first to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect theory's utility function on the whole domain. Our method also provides an efficient way to elicit utility midpoints, which are important in axiomatizations of utility. Several definitions of loss aversion have been put forward in the literature.

We not only analyze empirical data from five U.S. industries spanning eight years, but also expand theoretical insights to the network level by building a computer simulation model. Both our empirical and simulation results reveal the contingencies of the ambidexterity hypothesis in alliance formation. Our findings show that although an ambidextrous formation of alliances benefits large firms, a focused formation of either exploratory or exploitative alliances benefits small firms. In an uncertain environment an ambidextrous formation enhances firm performance but so does a focused formation in a stable environment. Finally, the simulation model demonstrates that a firm's centrality and structural hole positions in network relations can moderate the relationships between alliance formation choices and firm performance, and that the ambidexterity hypothesis may be limited to the earlier stage of the network. Our study provides critical evidence into the viability of adopting a dynamic network perspective in understanding the ambidexterity hypothesis and advancing strategic alliance research beyond static and dyadic levels.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0712","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of strategic alliances and firm performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While better demand information has a positive direct effect for the manufacturer in improving the efficiency of holding inventory in a channel, it can also have the strategic effect of increasing retail prices and limiting the extraction of retail profits. Having inventory in the channel can help the manufacturer to manage retail pricing behavior while better extracting retail surplus. Thus, even if the information system is perfectly reliable, the manufacturer might not always want to institute an information-enabled channel over a channel with inventory. We show this first in a channel with a single retailer, where the channel with perfect information is preferred over the channel with inventory only if the marginal cost of production is sufficiently high. We also analyze a channel with an imperfectly reliable information system and find that if the manufacturer were to choose the precision of the demand information system, it might not prefer perfect information, even if such information was costless to acquire. In a channel with competing retailers, the channel with perfect information is preferred when retail competition is sufficiently intense. Thus, the presence of inventory can play a role in managing competition among retailers and in helping the manufacturers to appropriate surplus especially when retailers are sufficiently differentiated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0713","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and demand information without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2007","53","10","Enno SiemsenEnno Siemsensiemsen@uiuc.eduDepartment of Business Administration, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois 61820Search for more papers by this author, Sridhar BalasubramanianSridhar Balasubramaniansridhar_balasubramanian@unc.eduDepartment of Marketing, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599Search for more papers by this author, Aleda V.

We analytically investigate the effect of each type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages, on the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and workgroup-level incentives, managers can balance the need to induce cooperation and coordination among employees with the need to manage employees' incentive-related risk. Counter to conventional wisdom, we also demonstrate that both group and individual incentives are necessary to facilitate cooperative behaviors such as knowledge sharing in workgroups.

Cash-flow risk also causes credit-risk interdependencies between firms. Our model applies to the case where not only financial flows but also operations are dependent across firms.

Both the purchase quantity and the price need to be determined. An optimal procurement strategy for the buyer requires the buyer to first design a supply contract that specifies a payment for each possible purchase quantity and then invites the suppliers to bid for this contract. The auction can be conducted in many formats such as the English auction, the Dutch auction, the first-priced, sealed-bid auction, and the Vickrey auction. The winner is the supplier with the highest bid, and is given the decision right for the quantity produced and delivered. Applying this theory to a newsvendor model with supply-side competition, this paper establishes a connection between the above optimal procurement strategy and a common practice in the retail industry, namely, the use of slotting allowances and vendor-managed inventory. Also discussed in the newsvendor context are the role of well-known supply contracts such as returns contracts and revenue-sharing contracts in procurement auctions, the scenarios where the buyer and suppliers may possess asymmetric information about the demand distribution, and how the cost of supply-demand mismatch is affected by supply-side competition. Finally, this paper compares the optimal procurement strategy with a simpler but suboptimal strategy where the buyer first determines a purchase quantity and then seeks the lowest-cost supplier for the quantity in an auction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0716","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on procurement strategies and auction formats without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The economic value of such association to the consumer of a brand is coming from its affect on the information exchange between consumers engaged in a search for partnerships with each other. It turns out that the brand use can be valuable to consumers for communication even when they do not have the proper incentives to make simple conversations valuable or informative.

The possibility of generating more income, if necessary, increases the risk-taking appetite of the investor. We find the optimal allocation to the risky security as a proportion of financial wealth and as a proportion of the total wealth, defined as the combination of the financial wealth and the human capital of the investor. When the investor's objective is the maximization of the terminal wealth, we show that the optimal allocation to the risky security is a hump-shaped function of the investment horizon. However, when the investor maximizes utility from intertemporal consumption, the optimal allocation in the risky security is a constant proportion of the total wealth of the investor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0725","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio selection and risk management without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In fact, there is a fair amount of debate on the effects of marketing actions of pharmaceutical firms toward physicians and their impact on physician prescription behavior. While some scholars find a strong and positive influence of marketing actions, some find only moderate effects, and others even find negative effects. Debate is also mounting on the role of other influencers (such as patient requests) in physician decision making, both on prescriptions and sample dispensing. The authors argue that one factor that may tip the balance in this debate is the role of drug characteristics, such as a drug's effectiveness and a drug's side effects. Using a unique data set, they show that marketing efforts\u2014operationalized as detailing and symposium meetings of firms to physicians\u2014and patient requests do affect physician decision making differentially across brands. Moreover, they find that the responsiveness of physicians' decision making to marketing efforts and patient requests depends upon the drug's effectiveness and side effects. This paper presents clear guidelines for public policy and managerial practice and envisions that the study of the role of drug characteristics, such as effectiveness and side effects, may lead to valuable insights in this surging public debate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0718","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['public scrutiny', 'marketing actions', 'physician decision making']","The article discusses the influence of marketing on physician decision-making and public scrutiny of these practices, indicating some awareness of ethical considerations.

This study addresses the following decision problem for an ESLD patient with an available living donor. Should she have a transplantation now or wait? If she decides to have the transplantation now, should she use her living-donor liver or a cadaveric liver for transplantation? We formulate this problem as a discrete-time, infinite-horizon Markov decision process model and solve it using clinical data. Because living donors are typically related to the recipient, we incorporate a disutility associated with using the living-donor liver as opposed to using a cadaveric liver.

DMs judged the probabilities that the stocks will reach a certain threshold, provided lower and upper bounds of these forecasts, and estimated median, 50%, 70%, and 90% confidence intervals of their future prices. We found that the judgments were internally consistent and coherent, but in most cases they were slightly miscalibrated. We used several new methods of analysis that allow for more precise and reliable comparison between the two response modes. We inferred point probability estimates for the target events from the confidence intervals and analyzed them by the same methods applied to binary judgments.

We consider a competitive forecaster's best response to truthful reporting and also investigate equilibrium reporting functions in the case where another forecaster also cares about relative performance. We show how a decision maker can revise probabilities of an event after receiving reported probabilities from competitive forecasters and note that the strategy of exaggerating probabilities can make well-calibrated forecasters (and a decision maker who takes their reported probabilities at face value) appear to be overconfident. However, a decision maker who adjusts appropriately for the misrepresentation of probabilities by one or more forecasters can still be well calibrated.

Attention is measured in terms of selection and gaze duration. We focus on the effects of the surface sizes of the design elements.

To capture the clutter effects, we propose two new entropy-based measures that characterize the salience of feature ads in their competitive environment based on Attention Engagement Theory. In a Bayesian framework, we simultaneously estimate the parameters of the model and optimize the design of feature ads in terms of surface sizes of the five design elements. Our optimization results and comparisons with alternative design approaches indicate that significant improvements in attention to feature advertising can be achieved without increase in costs, and that the resultant optimal feature ad designs create win-win opportunities for manufacturers and retailers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0732","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing advertising design through technical analysis of consumer attention without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts to achieve an efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the supply contract to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a buyer grants a financial \u201chostage\u201d to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from renegotiation. \u201cTradable options,\u201d which grant buyers the right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers.

Finally, the firms may renegotiate to allow a buyer facing poor market conditions to purchase less than the contractual commitment and a buyer facing favorable conditions to purchase more. We show that renegotiation can greatly increase the firms' investments and profits, provided that the contracts are designed correctly. Failing to anticipate renegotiation leads to contracts that allow too much flexibility in the buyer's order quantity, and perform poorly relative to contracts designed to anticipate renegotiation.

Less is known, however, about how more mature firms learn, when they are further down the learning curve. To gain insight into factors that enhance learning in this situation, I examine factors that increase both the ability and the opportunity to learn. I hypothesize that the ability to learn is enhanced by the presence of a moderate amount of temporary employees in the workforce and by providing employees with related variation in tasks, measured by product heterogeneity. In addition, I hypothesize that opportunities for learning are created when there is some slack in resources and when there are no problems in other important performance dimensions that consume employee attention. These hypotheses are examined using data of the Royal Dutch Mail, which has 27 geographically dispersed regions. Although these 27 regions are homogeneous with respect to their tasks, internal organization, type of products delivered, and technology used, their learning rates differ considerably. In the sample of 972 observations used for this analysis, I find that this variation in learning rates is explained by the percentage of temporary employees used, the level of excess capacity, the degree of product heterogeneity, and the degree to which regions face problems in other important performance dimensions. These findings provide insight into strategies that help managers in designing work processes to maintain a positive learning curve.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0733","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['opportunity', 'temporary employees', 'learning']","The article discusses factors that enhance learning opportunities within organizations, particularly focusing on temporary employees, which touches on workforce dynamics.

What product technology strategies increase the survival chances of entrants into new, technologically dynamic industries? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by pre-entry experience? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by when firms enter a new industry? Consistent with the published literature, we find that diversifying entrants have an initial survival advantage over entrepreneurial startups.

Further, firms with higher IT risk have a higher marginal product of IT relative to firms with low IT risk. In the market value specification, the impact of IT risk is positive and significant, and inclusion of the IT risk term substantially reduces the coefficient on IT capital. We estimate that about 30% of the gross return on IT investment corresponds to the risk premium associated with IT risk.

Known as \u201cpower by the hour\u201d in the private sector and as \u201cperformance-based logistics\u201d (PBL) in defense contracting, it aims to replace traditionally used fixed-price and cost-plus contracts to improve product availability and reduce the cost of ownership by tying a supplier's compensation to the output value of the product generated by the customer (buyer). To analyze implications of performance-based relationships, we introduce a multitask principal-agent model to support resource allocation and use it to analyze commonly observed contracts. In our model the customer (principal) faces a product availability requirement for the \u201cuptime\u201d of the end product. The customer then offers contracts contingent on availability to n suppliers (agents) of the key subsystems used in the product, who in turn exert cost reduction efforts and set spare-parts inventory investment levels. We show that the first-best solution can be achieved if channel members are risk neutral. When channel members are risk averse, we find that the second-best contract combines a fixed payment, a cost-sharing incentive, and a performance incentive. Furthermore, we study how these contracts evolve over the product deployment life cycle as uncertainty in support cost changes. Finally, we illustrate the application of our model to a problem based on aircraft maintenance data and show how the allocation of performance requirements and contractual terms change under various environmental assumptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0741","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['performance-based contracting', 'cost reduction', 'resource allocation']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of performance-based contracting and resource allocation in supply chains, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We also investigate the reason for this counterintuitive result. Finally, we present some managerial implications of our model. We show how our model can be used for cross-category targeting decisions by retailers. We find that compared to nontargeted discounting, the average profitability gain from customized discounting across the three category pairs is only 1.29% when complementarity is ignored, but this gain improves to 8.26% when full complementarity is taken into account. We also investigate whether ignoring the complex pattern of correlation has implications for managerial actions regarding targeting and optimal discounting.

This paper provides an answer to this question. We first show how a probability distribution over a set of possible values can be derived.

However, relationship properties that support relationship expansion (e.g., goal congruence and information exchange norms) reach their zenith in the build-up phase and afterwards fade into the background. All of the various relationship properties hit their nadir in the decline phase. We also examine the development of relationships over a five-year period and consider whether movement across the stages in accordance with DSO\u2019s theory has the same association to overall performance evaluations as movement through regressive patterns. We find that a negative history extracts a price: Movement through regressive patterns is negatively related to performance, and these relationships do not enjoy a fresh start. Instead, these movements can last for an extended period of time and are negatively related to performance outcomes during the decline phase. Thus, the development path taken appears to be related to the results achieved.

Specifically, we model two firms competing with each other in two markets characterized by price-dependent and uncertain demand. The firms make three decisions in the following sequence: choice of technology (technology game), capacity investment (capacity game), and production quantities (production game). The technology and capacity games occur while the demand curve is still uncertain, and the production game is postponed until after the demand curve is revealed. We develop best-response functions for each firm in the technology game and compare how a monopolist and a duopolist respond to a given flexibility premium. We show that the firms may respond to competition by adopting a technology which is the same as or different from what the competitor adopts. We conclude that contrary to popular belief, flexibility is not always the best response to competition\u2014flexible and dedicated technologies may coexist in equilibrium. We demonstrate that as the difference between the two market sizes increases, a duopolist is willing to pay less for flexible technology, whereas the decision of a monopolist is not affected. Further, we find that a firm that invests in flexibility benefits from a low correlation between demands for two products, but the extent of this benefit differs depending on the competitor\u2019s technology choice. Our results indicate that higher demand substitution may or may not promote the adoption of flexibility under competition, whereas it always facilitates the adoption of flexibility without competition. Finally, we show that contrary to intuition, as the competitor\u2019s cost of capacity increases, the premium a flexible firm is willing to pay for flexibility decreases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0611","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of technology choice and capacity investment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine the value of competition as a mechanism for the buyer to elicit service quality from the suppliers. We compare two approaches the buyer could use to orchestrate this competition: (1) a supplier-allocation (SA) approach, which allocates a proportion of demand to each supplier with the proportion allocated to a supplier increasing in the quality of service the supplier promises to offer, and (2) a supplier-selection (SS) approach, which allocates all demand to one supplier with the probability that a particular supplier is selected increasing in the quality of service to which the supplier commits. In both cases, suppliers incur a cost whenever they receive a positive portion of demand, with this cost increasing in the quality of service they offer and the demand they receive. The analysis reveals that (a) a buyer could indeed orchestrate a competition among potential suppliers to promote service quality, (b) under identical allocation functions, the existence of a demand-independent service cost gives a distinct advantage to SS-type competitions, in terms of higher service quality for the buyer and higher expected profit for the supplier, (c) the relative advantage of SS versus SA depends on the magnitude of demand-independent versus demand-dependent service costs, (d) in the presence of a demand-independent service cost, a buyer should limit the number of competing suppliers under SA competition but impose no such limits under SS competition, and (e) a buyer can induce suppliers to provide higher service levels by selecting an appropriate allocation function. We illustrate the impact of these results through three example applications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0612","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing and supplier competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Focusing on a stylized version of this problem, we study a finite horizon multiarmed bandit model with several plays per stage and Bayesian learning. Our analysis involves the Lagrangian relaxation of weakly coupled dynamic programs (DPs), results contributing to the emerging theory of DP duality, and various approximations. It yields a closed-form dynamic index policy capturing the key exploration versus exploitation trade-off and associated suboptimality bounds. In numerical experiments its performance proves comparable to that of other closed-form heuristics described in the literature, but this policy is particularly easy to implement and interpret. This last feature enables extensions to more realistic versions of the motivating dynamic assortment problem that include implementation delays, switching costs, and demand substitution effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0613","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product assortment and demand learning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We then consider a noncooperative game in steady state between two retailers competing on the basis of their service levels. The demand distributions of retailers in this game are modeled using a multiplicative aggregate market-share model in which the mean demands are obtained from the steady-state results for individual purchases, but the model is simplified in other respects for tractability. Our model yields a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that asymmetry in consumer learning has a significant impact on the optimal service levels, market shares, and profits of the retailers.

Although the analyst may impose various functional specifications exogenously, this approach is ad hoc, tedious, and reliant on various metrics to decide which specification is \u201cbest.\u201d In this paper, we develop a method that yields individual-level, flexibly shaped utility functions for use in choice models. This flexibility at the individual level is accomplished through splines of the truncated power basis type in a general additive regression framework for latent utility. Because the number and location of spline knots are unknown, we use the birth-death process of Denison et al. (1998) and Green\u2019s (1995) reversible jump method. We further show how exogenous constraints suggested by theory, such as monotonicity of price response, can be accommodated. Our formulation is particularly suited to estimating reaction to pricing, where individual-level monotonicity is justified theoretically and empirically, but linearity is typically not. The method is illustrated in a conjoint application in which all covariates are splined simultaneously and in three panel data sets, each of which has a single price spline. Empirical results indicate that piecewise linear splines with a modest number of knots fit these data well, substantially better than heterogeneous linear and log-linear a priori specifications. In terms of price response specifically, we find that although aggregate market-level curves can be nearly linear or log-linear, individuals often deviate widely from either. Using splines, hold-out prediction improvement over the standard heterogeneous probit model ranges from 6% to 14% in the scanner applications and exceeds 20% in the conjoint study. Moreover, \u201coptimal\u201d profiles in conjoint and aggregate price response curves in the scanner applications can differ markedly under the standard and the spline-based models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0616","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of modeling utility functions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We analyze a system with multiple retailers and one outside supplier. Random demand occurs at each retailer, and the supplier replenishes all the retailers. In traditional inventory models, each retailer orders directly from the supplier whenever the need arises. We present a new, centralized ordering policy that orders for all retailers simultaneously. The new policy is equivalent to the introduction of a warehouse with no inventory that is in charge of the ordering, allocation, and distribution of inventory to the retailers. Under such a policy, orders for some retailers may be postponed or expedited so that they can be batched with other retailers\u2019 orders, which results in savings in ordering and shipping costs. In addition to the policy we propose for supplying inventory to the retailers, we also consider three other policies that are based on these well-known policies in the literature: (a) can-order policy, (b) echelon inventory policy, and (c) fixed-replenishment interval policy. Furthermore, we create a framework for simultaneously making inventory and transportation decisions by incorporating the transportation costs (or limited truck capacities).

A surprising result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus.

Although the benefits of supply chain flexibility and component modularity for end-product manufacturers are accepted, little is known about their impact on suppliers. We advance the literature on modularity by exploring how three aspects of a supplier\u2019s relationships with its customers affect the supplier\u2019s survival: duration of buyer\u2013supplier relationships, autonomy from customers, and links to prominent buyers. We compared the effects of these aspects of buyer\u2013supplier relationships for low- and high-modularity components. Using data on U.S. carburetor and clutch manufacturers from 1918 to 1942, we found that suppliers of high-modularity components benefited more from autonomy provided by potential customers, whereas suppliers of low-modularity components benefited more from ties to higher status customers. Both benefited from autonomy generated by existing customers. Thus, relationships that require trust and extensive sets of interfirm routines, as do those for low-modularity components, led to both greater relationship benefits and greater constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0630","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['supplier', 'relationships', 'autonomy']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of buyer-supplier relationships and modularity without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

As stressed by Artzner et al. (1999, Coherent measures of risk, Math. Finance9(3) 203\u2013228), VaR may not possess the subadditivity property required to be a coherent measure of risk. The key idea of this paper is that, when tail thickness is responsible for violation of subadditivity, eliciting proper conditioning information may restore VaR rationale for decentralized risk management. The argument is threefold. First, since individual traders are hired because they possess a richer information on their specific market segment than senior management, they just have to follow consistently the prudential targets set by senior management to ensure that decentralized VaR control will work in a coherent way. The intuition is that if one could build a fictitious conditioning information set merging all individual pieces of information, it would be rich enough to restore VaR subadditivity. Second, in this decentralization context, we show that if senior management has access ex post to the portfolio shares of the individual traders, it amounts to recovering some of their private information. These shares can be used to improve backtesting to check that the prudential targets have been enforced by the traders. Finally, we stress that tail thickness required to violate subadditivity, even for small probabilities, remains an extreme situation because it corresponds to such poor conditioning information that expected loss appears to be infinite. We then conclude that lack of coherence of decentralized VaR management, that is VaR nonsubadditivity at the richest level of information, should be an exception rather than a rule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0632","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of risk management and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We start by investigating the presence and nature of contagion effects by defining alternative cross-country networks and testing their relative strength. Second, we study how the rate of diffusion differs between the two standards and between early- and later-adopting countries. Third, we identify which countries had more influence on diffusion than others. Empirically, we build a diffusion model which includes several possible cross-country contagion effects and then use Bayesian methods for estimation and model selection. Using country by year data for 56 countries and nine years, we find that accounting for cross-country influences improves both the fit and the prediction accuracy of our models. However, the specific cross-country contagion mechanism is different across the two standards. Diffusion of ISO 9000 is driven primarily by geography and bilateral trade relations, whereas that of ISO 14000 is driven primarily by geography and cultural similarity. We also find that the diffusion rate of ISO standards is higher for later-adopting countries and for the later ISO 14000 standard.

Both the buyer and the supplier incur quality-related costs, e.g., costs of customer goodwill and future market share loss by the buyer and warranty-related costs shared by both the buyer and the supplier whenever a nonconforming item is sold to a customer. Therefore, both parties have an incentive to invest in quality-improvement efforts. This paper explores the roles of different parties in a supply chain in quality improvement. We show that the buyer\u2019s involvement can have a significant impact on the profits of both parties and of the supply chain as a whole, and he cannot cede the responsibility of quality improvement to the supplier in many cases.

This paper studies a queueing model in which two strategic servers choose their capacities/processing rates and faster service is costly. The buyer allocates demand to the servers based on their performance; the faster a server works, the more demand the server is allocated. The buyer\u2019s objective is to minimize the average lead time received from the servers. There are two important attributes to consider in the design of an allocation policy: the degree to which the allocation policy effectively utilizes the servers\u2019 capacities and the strength of the incentives the allocation policy provides for the servers to work quickly. Previous research suggests that there exists a trade-off between efficiency and incentives, i.e., in the choice between two allocation policies a buyer may prefer the less efficient one because it provides stronger incentives. We find considerable variation in the performance of allocation policies: Some intuitively reasonable policies generate essentially no competition among servers to work quickly, whereas others generate too much competition, thereby causing some servers to refuse to work with the buyer. Nevertheless, the trade-off between efficiency and incentives need not exist: It is possible to design an allocation policy that is efficient and also induces the servers to work quickly. We conclude that performance-based allocation can be an effective procurement strategy for a buyer as long as the buyer explicitly accounts for the servers\u2019 strategic behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0636","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing models and performance-based allocation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using survey data from a sample of 120 business process (BP) redesign and related information technology (IT) development projects in healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream (BP) rework and downstream (IT) rework is mediated and mitigated by cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related to a lack of firm or industry experience with such projects increases the magnitude of upstream rework but not downstream rework or the amount of cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream rework and downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream rework significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream rework does not directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial function that reduces downstream rework, while uncertainty from a lack of experience with the design affecting upstream rework is not directly under managerial control.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0641","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['cooperative planning', 'uncertainty', 'managerial control']","The article focuses primarily on project management and operational efficiency without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Many new product development (NPD) alliances tend to be asymmetric, that is, they are formed between a larger firm and a smaller firm. As is the case with alliances in general, asymmetric alliances also typically result in changes in the shareholder values of the partner firms. Are the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms significant? Are asymmetric NPD alliances win-win or win-lose partnerships? Are the gains or losses symmetric for the larger and smaller partner firms? What factors drive the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms? These important questions remain largely unexplored as evidenced by the dearth of empirical research on the effect of asymmetric NPD alliances on shareholder value and on the apportionment of this value between the partner firms. We develop and empirically test a model of short-term changes in shareholder values of larger and smaller firms involved in NPD alliances, using the event study methodology on data covering 167 asymmetric alliances in the information technology and communication industries. In this model, we examine alliance, firm, and partner characteristics as potential determinants of the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms due to an NPD alliance announcement. Our model accounts for selection correction, potential cross-correlation across the residuals from the models of firm value changes for the larger and smaller firms, and unobserved heterogeneity. The results suggest that both the partners experience significant short-term financial gains, but there are considerable asymmetries between the larger and smaller firms with regard to the effects of alliance, partner, and firm characteristics on the gains of the partner firms. The results relating to alliance characteristics suggest that while a broad scope alliance enhances the financial gains for the larger firm, a scale R&D alliance (relative to a link alliance) contributes positively to the financial gains for the smaller firm. With regard to partner characteristics, while partner alliance experience positively influences the financial gains for the larger firm, it has no significant effect on the financial returns for the smaller firm. Further, partner innovativeness is positively associated with the financial gains for the larger firm, but partner reputation is unrelated to the financial gains of the smaller firm. Regarding firm characteristics, the magnitude of the financial gains accruing from a firm\u2019s own alliance experience is considerably higher for the smaller firm than it is for the larger firm. We outline the implications of the research findings for future research and management practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0642","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['shareholder value', 'asymmetric alliances', 'financial gains']","The article primarily focuses on financial metrics and the dynamics of partnerships between firms without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The main improvement of prospect theory over expected utility was in comparisons between a riskless and a risky prospect (riskless-risk methods).

When we include interaction effects between national income levels and country variables, we find that the impacts of interest rates, size of the financial sector, teledensity, and intellectual property rights are strongest in shaping IT investment for developed countries.

Researchers generally argue that these assumptions are \u201cgood enough\u201d to predict an industry\u2019s probable equilibria, and that disequilibrium adjustments and bounded rationality have limited competitive implications. Here we focus on the case of strategy in the presence of increasing returns to highlight how relaxing these two assumptions can lead to outcomes quite different from those predicted by standard neoclassical models. Prior research suggests that in the presence of increasing returns, tight appropriability, and accommodating rivals, in some circumstances early entrants can achieve sustained competitive advantage by pursuing \u201cget big fast\u201d (GBF) strategies: Rapidly expanding capacity and cutting prices to gain market share advantage and exploit positive feedbacks faster than their rivals. Using a simulation of the duopoly case we show that when the industry moves slowly compared to capacity adjustment delays, boundedly rational firms find their way to the equilibria predicted by conventional models. However, when market dynamics are rapid relative to capacity adjustment, forecasting errors lead to excess capacity\u2014overwhelming the advantage conferred by increasing returns. Our results highlight the risks of ignoring the role of disequilibrium dynamics and bounded rationality in shaping competitive outcomes, and demonstrate how both can be incorporated into strategic analysis to form a dynamic, behavioral game theory amenable to rigorous analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0673","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on neoclassical economic models and strategic behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

It argues that a dominant firm, seeing contraction of growth in its current segment(s), enters new segments in which it can exploit its technological strengths, but that are sufficiently distant to avoid cannibalization. The dominant firm acts as a low-cost Stackelberg leader, driving down prices and triggering a sales takeoff in the new segment. We identify a \u201cchurn\u201d effect associated with dominant firm entry: fringe firms that precede the dominant firm into the segment tend to exit the segment, while new fringe firms enter, causing a net increase in the number of firms in the segment. As the segment matures and sales decline in the segment, the process repeats itself. We examine the predictions of the theory with a study of price, quantity, entry, and exit across 24 product classes in the desktop laser printer industry from 1984 to 1996. Using descriptive statistics, hazard rate models, and panel data methods, we find empirical support for the theoretical predictions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0674","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive dynamics and market behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The theory typically assumes that each project or causally related set of projects is independent. However, casual observation suggests that firms expend much effort on managing and balancing their R&D pipelines, where managing appears to be related to the choice of R&D selection thresholds, project risk, and whether to buy or sell projects to fill the pipeline. Not only do these policies appear to differ across firms, they also appear to vary over time for the same firm. Changes in management policies suggest that the choice of R&D selection thresholds is a time-varying strategic decision and there may be some type of vertical interdependency among R&D projects in different stages. In this paper we develop a model using dynamic-programming techniques that explain why firms vary in their R&D project-management policies. The novelty and value of our model derives from the central insight that some firms invest in downstream cospecialized activities that would incur substantial adjustment costs if R&D efforts are unsuccessful whereas other firms have no such investment. If transaction costs in technology markets are positive, which implies that accessing the market for projects is costly, these investments lead to state-contingent project-selection rules that create a dynamic and vertical interdependency among R&D activities and product mix. We describe how choices of R&D selection thresholds, preferences over project risk, and use of technology markets for the buying and selling of projects differ by the state of the firm\u2019s pipeline, the magnitude of transaction costs in the adjustment market, and the magnitude of technology costs. These results yield interesting managerial and public policy implications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0676","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of R&D management and decision-making without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Descriptive research on industry dynamics has identified a dominant pattern where prices fall, output rises, and the number of firms rises and then falls over time. Several models have been advanced to explain these patterns, with a particular focus on explaining why a shakeout in the number of firms occurs. In the most prominent models, shakeout is generated by rising realized heterogeneity among firms that either is assumed to be unrecognized but determined ex ante or is generated by stochastic innovation outcomes coupled with convex adjustment costs and scale advantages in innovation and learning. In this paper, we develop an alternative model where heterogeneity develops among firms over time (leading to a shakeout) because firms must make choices about highly interdependent productive activities where the ideal combinations cannot be easily deduced or imitated. By combining two established models (a Cournot model of competition with an NK model of interdependency in production activities), we are able to advance an alternative explanation for the observed patterns of industry behavior, including shakeout. We show that variation in the potential for interdependency in activities among industries is able to explain varying levels of shakeout as well as differing patterns of entry and exit among industries. Notably, the model generates several empirical predictions not apparent in past research and several that directly conflict with the results of prominent alternative models of industry dynamics. Specifically, we show that when the potential for interdependency within an industry is low, entry slows down and incumbent survival is all but assured, whereas in industries where the potential for interdependencies is high, shakeouts are severe and the rates of entry and exit remain high over longer time periods, with decreasing survival rates for incumbents.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0679","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of industry dynamics and competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One of our objectives is to show how biform games, which introduce unstructured negotiations into game theory analysis, can be used to develop applied theory relevant to strategy. Generalizing from our stylized model, we identify a class of biform games involving buyers and suppliers that is useful for strategy analysis. Games in this class have the attractive property of each supplier\u2019s share of industry total surplus being the product of its added value and its relative bargaining power.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0680","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['buyer-supplier relationships', 'organizational tradeoffs', 'competitive advantage']","The article primarily focuses on strategic dimensions of firm operations and competitive advantage without addressing any social justice themes or ethical critiques.

Our aim is to deepen and extend resource-level theorizing about sustainable competitive advantage. Our analysis formalizes the notion of barriers to imitation, particularly those based on time compression diseconomies where the faster a firm develops a resource, the greater the cost. Time compression diseconomies are derived from a micromodel of resource development with diminishing returns to effort. We use a continuous time model of the flows of development costs and market revenues, which allows us to integrate strategic and financial analyses of firm investment problems. We examine two dimensions of sustainability: whether the resources underlying a firm\u2019s competitive advantage are economically imitable and, if so, how long imitation takes. Surprisingly, we show that sustainable competitive advantage does not necessarily lead to superior performance. We find that imitators sometimes benefit from reductions in their absorptive capacity and that innovators should license either all or none of their knowledge.

With positively correlated performance measures, absent a switching cost, turnover every period is optimal. In the presence of a fixed switching cost, interior optimal turnover policies exist if the performance measures are positively correlated.

Consumers can get the product from an alternative list price channel. We consider two variants of this problem: In the first variant, the list price is an external channel run by another firm. In the second one, the seller manages both the auction and the list price channels. Each consumer, trying to maximize his own surplus, must decide either to buy at the posted price and get the item at no risk, or to join the auction and wait until its end, when the winners are revealed and the auction price is disclosed. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we study structural properties of the problem, and show that the equilibrium strategy for both versions of this game is of the threshold type, meaning that a consumer will join the auction only if his arrival time is above a function of his own valuation. This consumer\u2019s strategy can be computed using an iterative algorithm in a function space, provably convergent under some conditions. Unfortunately, this procedure is computationally intensive. Second, and to overcome this limitation, we formulate an asymptotic version of the problem, in which the demand rate and the initial number of units grow proportionally large. We obtain a simple closed-form expression for the equilibrium strategy in this regime, which is then used as an approximate solution to the original problem. Numerical computations show that this heuristic is very accurate. The asymptotic solution culminates in simple and precise recipes of how bidders should behave, as well as how the seller should structure the auction, and price the product in the dual-channel case.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0646","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and auction strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The strategic behavior of the participants in these markets interacts with the way fixed-price contracts are formulated and significantly affects supply chain efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate fixed-price contracting even though the fixed price is determined under inferior information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus. However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain, spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement shifts from fixed-price contracting to spot trading and in the limit, the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the manufacturers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0649","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance and procurement strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A temporary buyout option disappears once a regular bid is submitted, whereas a permanent option remains available until it is exercised or the auction ends. Such buyout price may be static and remain constant throughout the auction, or dynamic and vary as the auction progresses. We formulate a game-theoretic model featuring time-sensitive bidders with independent private values and Poisson arrivals but endogenous bidding times to answer the following questions: How should a seller set the buyout price (if at all)? What are the implications of using a temporary buyout option relative to a permanent one? What is the potential benefit associated with using a dynamic buyout price? For all buyout option types we exhibit a Nash equilibrium in bidder strategies, argue that this equilibrium constitutes a plausible outcome prediction, and study the problem of maximizing the corresponding seller revenue. Our numerical experiments suggest that when any participant is time sensitive, the seller may significantly increase his utility by introducing a buyout option, but that dynamic buyout prices may not provide a substantial advantage over static ones. Furthermore, whereas permanent buyout options yield higher predicted revenue than temporary options, they also provide additional incentives for late bidding and may therefore not be always more desirable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0650","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auction pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using the performance of the corresponding centralized system as a benchmark, we show that decentralized decisions in general are inefficient and lead to inferior performance due to the double marginalization effect.

To reflect the reality in production environments, we propose a scorecard that captures inventory considerations, production smoothing, and adherence-to-plans. We present a prescriptive convex-cost production planning model for the manufacturer, and a replenishment model for the retailer. We use our integrative reference model to study the potential benefits of CF partnerships. Overall, we find that the benefits of CF depend on the following key characteristics of the supply chain: the relative explanatory power of the supply chain partners, the supply side agility, and the internal service rate. CF is expected to bring high benefits to the supply chain when the manufacturer has the largest relative explanatory power. But quite disappointingly, in these cases a CF partnership does not appear to be valuable to the manufacturer. When the retailer is the dominant observer of market signals, CF typically yields a \u201cwin-win\u201d outcome. In order to effectively act upon the information exchanged via CF, the supply side needs to be sufficiently agile. The benefits reported in this paper should be considered as conservative. This is because CF partnerships often bring better information, improved decision support technologies, as well as process improvement to the trading partners. Consequently, the supply side agility can be improved. If this indeed happens, the compound benefits of CF can be dramatically higher than our conservative estimates.

We analyze the case of (imperfectly) competitive markets with demand uncertainty, wherein the choice of supply chain configuration (i.e., early or delayed differentiation) is endogenous to the competing firms. We characterize firms\u2019 choices in equilibrium and analyze the effects of these choices on quantities sold, profits, consumer surplus, and welfare. We demonstrate that purely strategic considerations not previously identified in the literature play a pivotal role in determining the value of delayed differentiation. In the face of either entry threats or competition, these strategic effects can significantly diminish the value of delayed differentiation. In fact, under plausible conditions, these effects dominate the traditional risk-pooling benefits associated with delayed differentiation, in which case early differentiation is the dominant strategy for firms, even under cost parity with delayed differentiation. We extend the main model to study the effects of alternate market structures, asymmetric markets, and inventory holdback. Our results\u2014in particular that for a broad range of parameter values, early differentiation is a dominant strategy even under cost parity with delayed differentiation\u2014are robust to these relaxations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0655","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on strategic considerations in supply chain management and market structures without addressing any themes related to social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

In the model, there is a monopolist who sells a finite inventory over a finite time horizon. The seller adjusts prices dynamically to maximize revenue. Customers arrive continually over the duration of the selling season. At each point in time, customers may purchase the product at current prices, remain in the market at a cost to purchase later, or exit, and they wish to maximize individual utility. The customer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions: they may have different valuations for the product and different degrees of patience (waiting costs). We demonstrate that heterogeneity in both valuation and patience is important because they jointly determine the structure of optimal pricing policies. In particular, when high-value customers are proportionately less patient, markdown pricing policies are effective because the high-value customers would buy early at high prices while the low-value customers are willing to wait (i.e., they are not lost). On the other hand, when the high-value customers are more patient than the low-value customers, prices should increase over time to discourage inefficient waiting. Contrary to intuition, we find that strategic waiting by customers may sometimes benefit the seller: when low-value customers wait, they compete for availability with high-value customers and thus increase their willingness to pay. Our results also shed light on how the composition of the customer population affects optimal revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Finally, we consider the long-run problem of selecting the optimal initial stocking quantity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0667","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['heterogeneity', 'consumer surplus', 'social welfare']","The article primarily focuses on dynamic pricing strategies and revenue maximization without a significant emphasis on socially progressive themes.

This model used parameters estimated from previous data, together with simple new assumptions to extend TAX to gambles with negative and mixed consequences. Contrary to all three forms of prospect theory, systematic violations of both coalescing and GLS were observed. Violations of GLS were confirmed by analyses of individual data patterns by means of an error model in which each choice can have a different rate of error. Without estimating any parameters from the new data, the TAX model predicted the majority choices in the new data fairly well, correctly predicting when modal choices would violate GLS, when they would satisfy it, and when indifference would be observed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0592","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making theories without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They have installed flexible manufacturing systems because these systems offer a powerful means for accommodating production and assembly of a variety of products. However, increased product variety comes at a cost. For instance, if the resource requires to be set up each time it switches to operate on a new product, the resulting delays and costs could negate the intended benefits of increased product variety. Analyzing these flexible resources for optimal design and operation is therefore very important. To address such issues, we model a flexible resource, serving multiple products, using a queueing model\u2014more precisely, a polling model. In this model, a single server attends to multiple service centers (queues) at which requests arrive and queue up for service, performing a setup at a polled queue only if that queue is nonempty. This is the state dependent (SD) polling model. Exact analysis of the SD polling model is inherently very complex. This paper presents a very efficient procedure to compute a hierarchy of successively improving bounds on the values of performance measures obtained from the SD polling model with the exact solution as its limit. This procedure can be applied to quickly estimate performance measures for large SD polling models previously deemed analytically intractable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0639","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of flexible manufacturing systems and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Firms may reject profitable opportunities that fall outside of their core activities. If employees own the intellectual property (IP), they may leave to do a start-up.

Upon arriving at a ticket queue, each customer is issued a numbered ticket. The number currently being served is displayed. An arriving customer balks if the difference between his ticket number and the displayed number exceeds his patience level. We propose a Markov chain model of a ticket queue and develop effective evaluation tools. These tools can help management quantify the service level and identify the performance gap between the ticket queue and the conventional physical queue, in which a waiting line is formed. We gain insights about the ways customer service is affected by information loss in the ticket queue. In particular, we show that ticket and physical queues have significantly different balking probabilities when customer patience is low and the system traffic is heavy. We also propose an improvement to the ticket queue that provides each customer with his expected waiting time conditioned on his observed number difference, which is shown to raise the performance of the ticket queue to that of the physical queue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0660","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queue management and performance analysis without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a duopoly model in which retailers choose prices and variety level in each category and consumers make their store choice between retail stores and a no-purchase alternative based on their utilities from each category. The common practice of category management (CM) is an example of a decentralized regime for controlling assortment because each category manager is responsible for maximizing his or her assigned category\u2019s profit. Alternatively, a retailer can make category decisions across the store with a centralized regime. We show that CM never finds the optimal solution and provides both less variety and higher prices than optimal. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that profit loss due to CM can be significant. Finally, we propose a decentralized regime that uses basket profits, a new metric, rather than accounting profits. Basket profits are easily evaluated using point-of-sale data, and the proposed method produces near-optimal solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0661","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['profit', 'assortment', 'category management']","The article primarily focuses on category management and profit optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Based on two real-world e-commerce data sets, we found that such graphs demonstrate topological features that deviate significantly from theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In particular, we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path lengths and a greater-than-expected tendency to cluster. Such deviations suggest that the consumers\u2019 product choices are not random even with the consumer and product attributes hidden. Our findings provide justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only on previous sales transactions. By analyzing the simulated consumer-product graphs generated by models that embed two representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these recommendation algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random graphs.

We propose a model of complex, self-referential learning and reasoning amongst economic agents that jointly produces security returns consistent with these general observed facts and which are supported here by empirical results presented for a benchmark sample of 50 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market we postulate is populated by traders who reason inductively while compressing information into a few fuzzy notions that they can in turn process and analyze with fuzzy logic. We analyze the implications of such behavior for the returns on risky securities within the context of an artificial stock market model. Dynamic simulation experiments of the market are conducted, from which market-clearing prices emerge, allowing us to then compute realized returns. We test the effects of varying values of the parameters of the model on the character of the simulated returns. The results indicate that the model proposed in this paper can jointly account for the presence of a power-law characterization of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns with exponent on the order of three, for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, for long memory in volatility, and for general nonlinear dependencies in returns.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0622","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical evidence and modeling of stock returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In addition, scale-free connectivity appears to be less volatile than random connectivity in response to an increase in the strength of external influences.

These models shed light on an enduring managerial question: How much exploration is necessary to discover a good configuration of decisions? The models suggest that, as interactions across decisions intensify and local optima proliferate, broader exploration is required. The models typically assume, however, that the interactions among decisions are distributed randomly. Contrary to this assumption, recent empirical studies of real organizational, social, and technological systems show that interactions among decisions are highly patterned. Patterns such as centralization, small-world connections, power-law distributions, hierarchy, and preferential attachment are common. We embed such patterns into an NK simulation model and obtain dramatic results: Holding fixed the total number of interactions among decisions, a shift in the pattern of interaction can alter the number of local optima by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, the long-run value of broader exploration is significantly greater in the face of some interaction patterns than in the face of others. We develop simple, intuitive rules of thumb that allow a decision maker to examine two interaction patterns and determine which warrants greater investment in broad exploration. We also find that, holding fixed the interaction pattern, an increase in the number of interactions raises the number of local optima regardless of the pattern. This validates prior comparative static results with respect to the number of interactions, but highlights an important implicit assumption in earlier work\u2014that the underlying interaction pattern remains constant as interactions become more numerous.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0626","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and system behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we examine how an industry\u2019s productivity is affected by the IT capital stock of its suppliers. These supplier-driven IT spillovers occur because, due to competition in the supplying industry, quality benefits from suppliers\u2019 IT investments can pass downstream. If the output deflators of supplying industries (consequently the intermediate input deflator of the using industries) do not capture the quality improvement from IT, then the output productivity of the supplying industries is mismeasured or misassigned. We develop and empirically test a model capturing these supplier-driven effects using data on 85 manufacturing industries at the three-digit SIC code level. We find that for a 10.5% increase in suppliers\u2019 IT capital, the suppliers\u2019 output increases by 0.63%\u20130.70%, which is more than covering the cost of the increase in suppliers\u2019 IT capital. In addition, this increase in suppliers\u2019 IT capital increases the average downstream industry\u2019s output by $66\u2013$72 million, thereby confirming substantial supplier-driven IT spillovers downstream. We also infer the magnitude of the measurement error of the price deflator of the intermediate input resulting from the failure to account for IT-related quality improvement, finding that the measured price deflator overestimates the true deflator by approximately 30% at the mean level of IT capital.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0657","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT investments and their economic impacts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using multilevel modeling, we analyze extensive data archives covering more than 14 years of systems development work on a major telecommunications product dating from the beginning of its development process. Our findings reveal that the relative importance of the different types of experience differs across levels of analysis. Specialized experience has the greatest impact on productivity for MRs completed by individual developers, whereas diverse experience in related systems plays a larger role in improving productivity for MRs and system releases completed by groups and organizational units.

We refer to this uncertainty about the number of competitors as market-structure uncertainty. Over the course of several market sessions sellers learn about the competitive nature of the marketplace. How they learn to reduce the market-structure uncertainty depends on the market-transparency scheme, or the revelation policy adopted. A revelation policy determines the extent to which information\u2014the number of sellers in a session, their bidding patterns, etc.\u2014is revealed to sellers. Because these policies control what sellers learn and how they bid in future sessions, they determine buyer surplus. Possibly because market-structure uncertainty is more prevalent in information technology-enabled marketplaces than traditional ones, prior work has not addressed the impact of revelation policies on this type of uncertainty. Currently, there is little guidance available to buyers in choosing the appropriate revelation policy. To address this information-technology-enabled problem, we use game theory to compare the buyer surplus generated under a set of revelation policies commonly used in electronic reverse marketplaces. We demonstrate that the policy that generates the least amount of market-structure uncertainty for the sellers always maximizes buyer surplus. We further investigate to provide intuition regarding how bidders\u2019 reactions to overcome uncertainty differs with the nature of uncertainty, and how those reactions impact buyer surplus.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0688","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market-structure uncertainty and buyer surplus without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We focus on the question of whether one can globally set a pair of coordinating transshipment prices, i.e., payments that each party has to make to the other for the transshipped goods, that induce the local decision makers to make inventory and transshipment decisions that are globally optimal. A recent paper suggests, for a special case of our model, that there always exists a unique pair of coordinating transshipment prices. We demonstrate through a counterexample that this statement is not correct and derive sufficient and necessary conditions under which it would hold. We show that in some conditions, coordinating prices may exist for only a narrow range of problem parameters and explore conditions when this can happen.

Theory is presented for general utility functions and mean-variance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring resource diversification, flexibility (e.g., inventory substitution), and sharing (commonality). In contrast to single-resource settings, risk-averse newsvendors may invest more in networks than risk-neutral newsvendors: some resources and even total spending may exceed risk-neutral levels. With normally distributed demand, risk-averse newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand variance, while risk-neutral agents adjust only proportionally to standard deviation. Two effects explain this operational hedge and suggest rules of thumb for strategic placement of safety capacity and inventory in networks: (1) Risk pooling suggests rebalancing capacity toward inexpensive resources that serve lower-profit variance markets. This highlights the role of profit variance (instead of demand variance) in risk-averse network investment. (2) Ex post revenue maximization suggests rebalancing capacity toward substitutable flexible but away from shared capacity when markets differ in profitability. Capacity imbalance and allocation flexibility thus mitigate profit risk and truly are operational hedges.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0700","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['resource allocation', 'risk mitigation', 'flexibility']","The article focuses primarily on operational strategies for risk mitigation and resource allocation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Transaction-cost theory, on the other hand, assumes generally competitive markets and does not address the industry life cycle. It therefore implies that transaction-cost economizing is a superior firm strategy regardless of the stage of the life cycle. This paper seeks to reconcile these two streams of research by investigating whether aligning transactions with governance modes in accordance with transaction-cost prescriptions has a differential effect on firm survival in preshakeout versus shakeout stages of the industry life cycle. Analyzing data from the early U.S. auto industry (1917\u20131933), we find that while transaction misalignment did not have a significant impact on firm survival during the preshakeout stage or during the period as a whole, it did have a significantly larger negative impact on survival during the shakeout stage than during the preshakeout stage. We also find that the negative effects of misalignment on survival were significantly weaker for larger firms during the shakeout stage. This suggests that applications of transaction-cost theory which assume uniformly severe selection pressures across the industry life cycle and uniform effects of misalignment across firms of different sizes could be misleading. It also suggests that theories of the industry life cycle could usefully take transaction costs into account along with production costs in their analyses of competition over the life cycle.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0706","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on transaction-cost theory and firm survival without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

A well-known problem with the incentive-compatible Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is that the resulting prices may not be in the core. Loosely speaking, this means the payments of the winners could be so low, that there are bidders who would have been willing to pay more than the payments of the winning bidders. Clearly, this \u201cunfair\u201d outcome is unacceptable for a public sector auction. Recent advances in auction theory suggest that combinatorial auctions resulting in efficient outcomes and bidder-Pareto-optimal core payments offer a viable practical alternative to address this problem. This paper confronts two critical issues facing the bidder-Pareto-optimal core payment. First, motivated to minimize a bidder's ability to benefit through strategic manipulation (through collusive agreement or unilateral action), we demonstrate the strength of a mechanism that minimizes total payments among all such auction outcomes, narrowing the previously broad solution concept. Second, we address the computational difficulties of achieving these outcomes with a constraint-generation approach, promising to broaden the range of applications for which bidder-Pareto-optimal core pricing achieves a comfortably rapid solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0662","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['fair', 'unfair', 'public sector', 'efficient', 'payments']","The article discusses fairness in pricing public goods and addresses the concept of 'unfair' outcomes in auctions, which aligns with moderate woke themes of equity and ethical considerations in public sector practices.

In these situations, firms must decide not only whether to raise prices, but to whom. Specifically, in a competitive context, they must determine whether it is more profitable to increase prices across-the-board or to a specific segment of their customer base. While selective price decreases are ubiquitous in practice (e.g., better deals to potential new customers by phone carriers; better deals to current customers by various magazines), to our knowledge selective price increases are relatively rare. We illustrate the benefits of targeted price increases, and, as such, we expand the repertoire of firms' promotional policies. To that end, we explore a scenario where two competing firms must decide whether to increase prices to the entire market or only to a specific segment. Targeted price increases (TPI), i.e., being offered an unchanged price (selectively) when others are subject to price increases, can be offered to Loyals (those who bought from the firm in the previous period) or Switchers (those who did not). The effects of TPIs are estimated through a laboratory experiment and an associated stochastic model, each allowing for both rational (Loyalty, Switching) and behaviorist (Betrayal, Jealousy) effects. We find that TPIs can indeed yield beneficial results (greater retention for Loyals or greater attraction of Switchers) and greater profits in certain circumstances. Results for TPI are additionally benchmarked against those for targeted price decreases and are found to differ. The range of effects stemming from the experiment can be used in a competitive analysis to yield equilibrium strategies for the two firms. In this case, we find that\u2014depending on the magnitude of the price increase, market shares of the two firms, and price knowledge across consumer segments\u2014a firm may wish to embrace targeted price increases in some situations, to institute across-the-board price increases in others, and to not enact any price increases in still others. We show that a firm can sacrifice considerable profit if it settles on a suboptimal pricing strategy (e.g., wrongly instituting an across-the-board increase), favors the wrong segment (e.g., Switchers instead of Loyals), or ignores \u201cbehaviorist\u201d effects (Betrayal or Jealousy).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0695","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies and profitability without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

Two phenomena emergent in such a market are investigated: forward-looking bidding strategies, and closed-loop selling strategies that involve learning from past prices. The buyers shade their bids down, i.e., bid less than they would in a single isolated auction, whenever they expect the seller to sell another unit of the good in the near future. Unlike in exogenous sequences of auctions, the optimal bidding strategy thus depends on the seller's selling strategy. The converse dependence also occurs: the seller can learn about current demand from past realized prices, and sell only in periods with high-enough demand. Such learning depends on the extent of bid-shading because the seller needs to invert the bidding strategy to learn. In equilibrium, buyer bid-shading persists even when the seller does not sell in every period, but it is self-regulating in that it eventually vanishes when the existence of the market is threatened by low seller profits. In this sense, auction markets have a \u201cself-preservation instinct.\u201d General properties of learning about current demand from past auction prices are also investigated and characterized.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0691","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auction theory and bidding strategies without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy. Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album's survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival.

The framework may also be used to extract probabilities of default (PD) functions from market data. Our approach is entirely based on observables such as equity prices and interest rates, rather than on unobservable processes such as firm value. The model stitches together in an arbitrage-free setting a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) equity model (to represent the behavior of equity prices prior to default), a default intensity process, and a Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for the evolution of riskless interest rates. The model captures several stylized features such as a negative relation between equity prices and equity volatility, a negative relation between default intensity and equity prices, and a positive relationship between default intensity and equity volatility. We embed the model on a discrete-time, recombining lattice, making implementation feasible with polynomial complexity. We demonstrate the simplicity of calibrating the model to market data and of using it to extract default information. The framework is extensible to handling correlated default risk and may be used to value distressed convertible bonds, debt-equity swaps, and credit portfolio products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Applied to the CDX INDU (credit default index\u2013industrials) Index, we find the S&P 500 index explains credit premia.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0702","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing securities and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The value of a project to a firm depends not only on its properties but also on the other projects being developed by the firm. This is due to interactions with the other projects that address the same consumer need and require the same development resources. In this study, we empirically investigate the structure and significance of these portfolio-level project interactions. Using a self-developed pharmaceutical industry data set, we conduct an event study around the failure of phase III clinical trials and their effect on the market valuation of the firm. The study exploits the natural experiment of a product development failure to give us a measure of the value of a drug development project to a firm. We then explain the variance in the value of projects based on interactions with other projects in the firm's portfolio. We find that the presence of other projects targeting the same market and a build-up of projects that require the same development resources reduce the value of a development project. In addition to providing evidence on the significance and structure of these portfolio-level project interactions, the empirical model estimated in this paper also provides a data-driven approach to valuing projects that may be relevant to licensing transactions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0703","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of project valuation in the pharmaceutical industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

All cost parameters associated with each technology (procurement cost, salvage value, etc.) evolve dynamically. We investigate two technology-inventory coordination schemes, one is at the strategic level, where technology and inventory decisions are sequentially made using partial information, and another is at the operational level, where technology and inventory decisions are jointly made using full information. The performance gap between the two coordination schemes quantifies the value of incorporating dynamic inventory information in technology management. We develop effective solution techniques and approximation methods and characterize their policy structures. Our numerical study indicates that the strategic-level technology-inventory coordination is generally sufficient, but the operational-level coordination becomes necessary when demand variability is high and salvage loss is heavy. We also propose a hybrid technology-inventory coordination scheme, whereby the firm adopts a technology management plan using the strategic-level coordination scheme, but executes it dynamically by adapting to inventory information, using a heuristic proposed in this paper. Our numerical study suggests that the hybrid strategy can virtually achieve the performance of the optimal operational level coordination.

Specifically, we develop an introductory mathematical model to incorporate the use of two types of information, system status (queuing congestion) and customer profile (likelihood of purchase) in determining the optimal control policy to maximize the expected operating profit of the system.

Because the product is ill defined at this point in time, the buyer is unable to commit to the future terms of trade through a court-enforceable contract. Instead, to provide incentives for capacity investment, the buyer informally promises future terms of trade. The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-quantity promises and compare their performance. If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0126","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity investment and contract terms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, as is the case in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor\u2019s suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor\u2019s suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier\u2019s reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier\u2019s order depends on its reliability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0128","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated. However, as the number of suppliers increases, our model predicts that the retailer may be able to take advantage of both competition and diversification.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0122","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and supplier competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory. The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy. Finally, by comparing the costs associated with these policies and several benchmark systems, we quantify the true value of accurate inventory information, which may be provided by radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0136","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Over the last several years, B2B exchanges have attempted to provide supply for storable industrial goods with some degree of design specification (as opposed to undifferentiated commodities). Through this research, we elucidate some aspects of how speculative online exchanges with a small number of participants might behave and the impact they will have on the use of long-term contracts for supply. By endogenizing the evolution of spot prices in response to buyers\u2019 and their supplier\u2019s actions, we produce price fluctuations that exhibit significant autocorrelation in such markets. We show that participating buyers accrue network benefits as the number of participating firms increases through the inventory-pooling effects, resulting in reduced costs for them. However, a supplier acting strategically will counteract such benefits by restricting availability of goods to the spot market, sacrificing short-term spot-market revenue for long-term contract volume.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0137","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and supply chain dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Companies have to quote attainable delivery dates and then meet these, or face large tardiness penalties. We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with due date assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions of the amount of a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The due date assignment methods studied include the common due date, the slack due date, which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted due dates, when each job may be assigned a different due date. For each combination of due date assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, due date values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and due date assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0139","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management, specifically scheduling and resource allocation, without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Investment into productive resources is made before demand realization, hence the supply chain faces the risk of under- or overinvestment.

We consider two scenarios in which this risk is borne by the OEM and CM, respectively. We determine which party should bear the risk so that maximum supply chain profits are achieved. We investigate the effectiveness of premium-based schemes in inducing the best party to bear the risk, and conclude that they function well despite information asymmetry when double marginalization is not very high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0141","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and risk allocation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one. We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how the model\u2019s inputs should be estimated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0145","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of the newsvendor model and its application in inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we consider a supplier-retailer supply chain in which the supplier starts production well in advance of the selling season, and the retailer is offered two ordering opportunities at different points in time. An early order is allowed before the supplier\u2019s production decision, and a late order is allowed after the completion of production and after observing the demand. When the two wholesale prices change, we illustrate how the inventory decision rights and ownership are shifted and/or shared between the two firms, resulting in push, pull, or advance-purchase discount contracts. We then characterize the complete set of Pareto-dominant contracts for any given two-wholesale-price contract. We find that Pareto improvement can be achieved when inventory ownership is shifted from individual to shared and sometimes vice versa. In the latter case, push contracts not only are more likely to offer Pareto improvement, but also can achieve higher supply chain efficiency than pull contracts. We also identify conditions that enable Pareto improvement by introducing a new ordering opportunity to firms that had been bound by a single ordering opportunity without renegotiating the existing wholesale price, and we demonstrate through a numerical study that the adoption of the new ordering opportunity can significantly improve supply chain efficiency. We show that such Pareto improvement is more likely to happen when demand is more volatile.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0151","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These papers then analyze the resulting competition among suppliers and mathematically characterize the equilibrium actions. There remains a question, however, as to whether the original customer models on which the analyses are built are reasonable representations of actual consumer choice. In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems. We find that some of the most analytically tractable models perform best in tests of model fit. We also find that the expected number of consecutive trials of a given supplier is increasing in its expected quality level, with increasing differences, a result consistent with the models' predictions as well as with loyalty effects described in the popular management literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0130","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of consumer choice and supplier competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Anecdotal evidence and a growing number of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level operating capabilities critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i.e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level operating capabilities such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U.S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on operating capabilities and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0131","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational intellectual capital and its impact on business performance without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

One method that can be applied in such cases uses dispersion among forecasting experts as a measure of demand uncertainty. This paper provides a test for this method and presents a heteroscedastic regression model for estimating the variance of demand using dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale. We test this methodology using three data sets: demand data at item level, sales data at firm level for retailers, and sales data at firm level for manufacturers. We show that the variance of a random variable (demand and sales for our data sets) is positively correlated with both dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale: The variance increases sublinearly with dispersion and more than linearly with scale. Further, we use longitudinal data sets with sales forecasts made three to nine months before the earnings report date for retailers and manufacturers to show that the effects of dispersion and scale on variance of forecast error are consistent over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0134","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for estimating demand uncertainty without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Although it is clear that self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0135","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of customer efficiency and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The objective of this study is to document the strength of the bullwhip effect in industry-level U.S. data. In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry's \u201cproduction\u201d) is greater than the variance of the industry's sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less seasonal an industry's demand, the more likely the industry amplifies volatility\u2014highly seasonal industries tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0149","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the technical aspects of the bullwhip effect in supply chains without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using empirical data from multiple stores of a consumer electronics retailer, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, we highlight the extent to which store manager incentive design impacts store manager behavior and, consequently, retail performance. More specifically, we describe the shift in store manager behavior resulting from a change in incentives, which, in part, altered the importance of sales relative to inventory shrinkage in the store manager compensation plan. Store managers, following this change, directed less attention to the prevention of inventory shrinkage and more toward sales-generating activities and made different process choices within the store. We observed increases in the level of inventory shrinkage and sales within these stores. Controlling for alternative drivers of sales and inventory shrinkage, we find this change in incentive design to be associated with a profit improvement of 4.2% of sales. This work indicates that altering how store managers are compensated impacts retail performance. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of balancing the rewards given for different types of activities in contexts where agents face multiple competing tasks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0150","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['incentive design', 'retail performance', 'compensation']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of incentive design and its impact on retail performance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In addition, reservations were expressed concerning the increasing \u201cmathematization\u201d of academic OR in the context of the established \u201chard\u201d or \u201cclassical\u201d paradigm. In this respect, British operations researchers, aided and abetted by a number of American colleagues (notably Ackoff, Churchman, and Miser), engaged in a fundamental reappraisal of the OR methodological repertoire and its client base. Thus, in Britain, a new phase in the history of OR was inaugurated whereby the \u201cpositivist/scientist\u201d approach bequeathed by the wartime pioneers was subject to challenge and qualification. Whilst some elements in the American OR community empathized with the emergent British critique, the response (notwithstanding Ackoff et al.) was, on the whole, relatively muted. This conservative American response provides one part of the rationale for this paper. The key issue here is to compare and contrast the tone and content of the Anglo-American debate on the future of OR after 1970: In simple terms, why did British OR practitioners and academics (especially the latter) respond so vigorously to the post-1970 OR critique in marked contrast to their American counterparts?

When the time interval between consumption periods is large, and there are, therefore, no carryover effects, our model coincides with the DU model.

However, nonsmooth demand functions are an important feature of real power markets due, for example, to price caps and generator recognition of transmission constraints that limit exports. A more general model of Nash-Cournot competition on networks is proposed that accounts for these features by including (1) concave piecewise-linear demand curves and (2) joint constraints that include variables from other generating companies within the profit maximization problems for individual generators. The piecewise demand curves imply, in general, a nonmonotone multivalued variational inequality problem. Thus, for instance, imposition of a price cap can destroy the uniqueness properties found in previous models, so that distinct solutions can yield different sets of profits for market participants. The joint constraints turn the equilibrium problem into a quasi-variational inequality, which also can yield multiple solutions. The formulation poses computational challenges that can cause Lemke\u2019s algorithm to fail; a restricted formulation is proposed that can be solved by that algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0342","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Nash-Cournot models in electricity markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we provide a potential explanation for this prevalence of supply contracts even when spot markets are liquid and without delivery lag. Specifically, we consider the determination of an equilibrium forward contract on a nonstorable commodity between two firms that have mean-variance preferences over their risky profits and negotiate the forward contract through a Nash bargaining process. We derive the unique equilibrium forward contract in closed form and provide an extensive analysis. We show that it is the risk-hedging benefit from a forward that justifies its prevalence in spite of liquid spot markets. In addition, while a forward does not affect production decisions due to the presence of spot markets, it does affect inventory decisions of the storable input factor due to its hedging effect against the inventory risk. We also show that price volatilities and correlations are important determinants of the equilibrium contract. In particular, the equilibrium forward price can be nonmonotonic in the spot price volatility and can decrease as the initial spot price increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0351","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply contracts and market dynamics without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

This allows us to use known univariate results in the multidimensional setting, and to add new results in this direction. In particular, we characterize a general class of objective functions (the so-called one- or two-point support functions), for which the robust objective is reduced to a deterministic optimization problem in one variable. Finally, we adapt a result from Geoffrion (1967a) to reduce the main problem to a parametric quadratic program. In particular, our results are true for increasing concave utilities with convex or concave-convex derivatives. Closed-form solutions are obtained for special discontinuous criteria, motivated by bonus- and commission-based incentive schemes for portfolio management.

Moreover, a decision maker\u2019s utility may depend not on the absolute level of performance on each attribute, but rather on whether that level of performance meets a target, in which case the decision maker is said to be target oriented. For example, typical attributes in new product development include cost, quality, and features, and the corresponding targets might be the best performance on these attributes by competing products. Targets and performance levels typically are uncertain and often are dependent. We develop a model that allows for uncertain dependent targets and uncertain dependent performance levels, and we study implications for decision making in this general multiattribute target-oriented setting. We consider the impact on expected utility of modifying key characteristics of performance (or target) distributions: location, spread, and degree of dependence.

These agreements typically apply to a piece of equipment that the customer has purchased, and they specify the type and timing of service that will be provided. If a customer operates in multiple locations, service agreements may cover several pieces of equipment at several locations. In this paper, we describe a continuous-review inventory model for a multi-item, multiechelon service parts distribution system in which time-based service-level requirements exist. Our goal is to determine base-stock levels for all items at all locations so that the service-level requirements are met at minimum investment. We derive exact time-based fill-rate expressions for each item within its distribution channel, as well as approximate expressions for the gradients of these fill-rate functions. Using these results, we develop an intelligent greedy algorithm that can be used to find near-optimal solutions to large-scale problems quickly, as well as a Lagrangian-based approach that provides both near-optimal solutions and good lower bounds with increased computational effort.

In addition, each retailer is associated with a retailer-dependent holding-cost rate. The structure of optimal replenishment policies is not known, thus research has focused on optimal power-of-two (POT) policies. Following this convention, we consider the cost allocation problem of an optimal POT policy among the various retailers. For this sake, we define a characteristic function that assigns to any subset of retailers the average-time total cost of an optimal POT policy for replenishing the retailers in the subset, under the assumption that these are the only existing retailers. We show that the resulting transferable utility cooperative game with this characteristic function is concave. In particular, it is a totally balanced game, namely, this game and any of its subgames have nonempty core sets.

It works by alternating two phases; one based on a stochastic local search and the other on a deterministic local search. The stochastic phase is fundamentally based on biased random sampling that iteratively constructs schedules according to a matrix whose entries are the probability with which exams can be assigned to time slots. The deterministic phase, instead, consists of assigning (according to a given ordering) each exam sequentially to the time slot that causes the lowest increase in the schedule penalty. After a schedule is constructed, swap operations are executed to improve performance. These two phases are coupled and made closely interactive by tunnelling information on what has happened during one phase to the successive ones. Moreover, the length of a phase and the parameter framework to be used in a new phase are automatically determined by a record of the process. We tested the proposed technique on known benchmarks, and a comparison with 17 algorithms drawn from the state of the art appears to show that our algorithm is able to improve best-known results. In particular, in reference to uncapacitated problems, i.e., the ones without room constraints, our algorithm bested the state of the art in 70% to 90% of the tested instances, while in capacitated problems with overnight conflicts (second-order conflicts), it was superior to all the other algorithms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0354","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical optimization algorithm for examination timetabling without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

A probabilistic programming approach is adopted for constructing an inventory-production-distribution plan over a multiperiod planning horizon. The plan does not allow the backlogging of the unsatisfied demand, and minimizes the costs of the supply chain while enabling it to reach a prescribed nonstockout service level. It is a strategic plan that hedges against undesirable outcomes, and that can be adjusted to account for possible favorable realizations of uncertain quantities. A modular, integrated, and computationally tractable method is proposed for the solution of the associated stochastic mixed-integer optimization problems containing joint probabilistic constraints with dependent right-hand side variables. The concept of p-efficiency is used to construct a finite number of demand trajectories, which in turn are employed to solve problems with joint probabilistic constraints. We complement this idea by designing a preordered set-based preprocessing algorithm that selects a subset of promising p-efficient demand trajectories. Finally, to solve the resulting disjunctive mixed-integer programming problem, we implement a special column-generation algorithm that limits the risk of congestion in the resources of the supply chain. The methodology is validated on an industrial problem faced by a large chemical supply chain and turns out to be very efficient: it finds a solution with a minimal integrality gap and provides substantial cost savings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0356","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Whereas the manufacturer is obligated to satisfy demand from these customers, it can dynamically choose which transactional orders to accept. In this paper, we analyze two scenarios. In the first scenario, the manufacturer produces contractual orders on a make-to-order basis, and in the second, it maintains finished goods inventory for such orders. At each decision epoch, the manufacturer decides which transactional orders to accept to maximize its long-run expected profit. When contractual items are made to stock, the manufacturer also chooses how much extra capacity to allocate to contractual items, over and above what is needed to meet realized demand. We establish the structure of the optimal policies and propose scalable heuristics when optimal policies are hard to compute/implement. Our models are then used to study the effect of demand variability on the optimal profit.

We show that this problem is NP-hard, even when all arc latency functions are linear and there is a single source and sink. Still, an optimal flow and an equilibrium flow share a desirable property in this situation: All flow-carrying paths have the same length, i.e., these solutions are \u201cfair,\u201d which is in general not true for optimal flows in networks with nonlinear latency functions. In addition, the maximum latency of the Nash equilibrium, which can be computed efficiently, is within a constant factor of that of an optimal solution. That is, the so-called price of anarchy is bounded. In contrast, we present a family of instances with multiple sources and a single sink for which the price of anarchy is unbounded, even in networks with linear latencies. Furthermore, we show that an s-t-flow that is optimal with respect to the average latency objective is near-optimal for the maximum latency objective, and it is close to being fair. Conversely, the average latency of a flow minimizing the maximum latency is also within a constant factor of that of a flow minimizing the average latency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0383","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['fair', 'equilibrium', 'latency']","The article discusses fairness in the context of network flows, which introduces a moderate woke theme by emphasizing equitable outcomes.

From the perspective of applications, this approach implicitly assumes that the model is an accurate representation of the real-world demand process and that the parameters characterizing this model can be accurately calibrated using data. In many situations, neither of these conditions are satisfied. Indeed, models are usually simplified for the purpose of tractability and may be difficult to calibrate because of a lack of data. Moreover, pricing policies that are computed under the assumption that the model is correct may perform badly when this is not the case. This paper presents an approach to single-product dynamic revenue management that accounts for errors in the underlying model at the optimization stage. Uncertainty in the demand rate model is represented using the notion of relative entropy, and a tractable reformulation of the \u201crobust pricing problem\u201d is obtained using results concerning the change of probability measure for point processes. The optimal pricing policy is obtained through a version of the so-called Isaacs\u2019 equation for stochastic differential games, and the structural properties of the optimal solution are obtained through an analysis of this equation. In particular, (i) closed-form solutions for the special case of an exponential nominal demand rate model, (ii) general conditions for the exchange of the \u201cmax\u201d and the \u201cmin\u201d in the differential game, and (iii) the equivalence between the robust pricing problem and that of single-product revenue management with an exponential utility function without model uncertainty, are established through the analysis of this equation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0385","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic revenue management and pricing policies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These candidate solutions are then used to update the parameters associated with the probabilistic model in such a way that the future search will be biased toward the region containing high-quality solutions. The parameter updating procedure in MRAS is guided by a sequence of implicit probabilistic models we call reference models. We provide a particular algorithm instantiation of the MRAS method, where the sequence of reference models can be viewed as the generalized probability distribution models for estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) with proportional selection scheme. In addition, we show that the model reference framework can also be used to describe the recently proposed cross-entropy (CE) method for optimization and to study its properties. Hence, this paper can also be seen as a study on the effectiveness of combining CE and EDAs.

We present an architecture for video-on-demand service delivery and model the assignment of bandwidth in the distribution network as a constrained, nonlinear optimization problem. To solve this optimization problem, we develop three new auction algorithm-based solution procedures. The optimization problem assumes that there is a functional relationship between the maximum acceptable end-to-end delay and the bandwidth requirement for the links in the distribution network. Absent reliable video traffic data models for MPEG-2 format, we sample a large number of DVD-recorded movies to form a basis for randomly generated aggregate traffic streams. The aggregate traffic streams are used in a simulation experiment to measure the maximum transmission buffer occupancy for each given traffic stream for different transmission rates. Based on this simulation experiment, we derive an empirical transmission line provisioning function that guarantees delivery of all video frames without frame loss within a maximum frame delay tolerance. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution procedure for the bandwidth assignment problem, we solve to near optimality 570 small problem instances under three demand structures and 100 large problem instances with uniformly distributed demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0370","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bandwidth optimization and video service delivery without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the event that some of the components required to fill an order are out of stock, these components must be expedited. The objective is to minimize the expected infinite-horizon discounted cost of primary component production and expediting. Our formulation captures financial holding costs but implicitly assumes that physical holding costs are negligible. The controls are (1) sequencing orders for assembly, (2) primary component production, and (3) component expediting. We prove that the multidimensional assemble-to-order control problem separates into single-item inventory control problems. In particular, under an optimal policy for assembly sequencing, the optimal production and expediting policy for each component is independent of all other components. Hence, the literature on single-item inventory management with expediting or lost sales is directly relevant to the control of assemble-to-order systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0372","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost minimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Production occurs either at a single facility located in one of the markets or at two facilities, one in each market. The company has to invest in capacity before the selling season starts when the demand in both markets and the currency exchange rate are uncertain. The currency exchange rate risk can be hedged by delaying allocation of the capacity to specific markets until both the currency and demand uncertainties are resolved and/or by buying financial option contracts on the currency exchange rate when capacity commitment is made. A mean-variance utility function is used to model the firm\u2019s risk aversion in decision making. We derive the joint optimal capacity and financial option decision, and analyze the impact of the delayed allocation option and the financial options on capacity commitment and the firm\u2019s performance. We show that the firm\u2019s financial hedging strategy ties closely to, and can have both quantitative and qualitative impact on, the firm\u2019s operational strategy. The use, or lack of use of financial hedges, can go beyond affecting the magnitude of capacity levels by altering global supply chain structural choices, such as the desired location and number of production facilities to be employed to meet global demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0364","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial and operational decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Two key findings are (1) early exponential growth of the disease may be dominated by susceptibles with high human contact frequencies and may not be indicative of the general population\u2019s susceptibility to the disease, and (2) social distancing may be an effective nonmedical way to limit and perhaps even eradicate the disease.

The essential new element linking routing and inventory management is a convex piecewise-linear cost function that is based on minimizing the expected number of pallets that still need transportation. For speed, the convex relaxation is solved approximately by a bundle approach yielding an online schedule in five to 12 minutes for up to three warehouses and 40,000 articles; in contrast, computation times of state-of-the-art LP solvers are prohibitive for online application. In extensive numerical experiments on a real-world data stream, the approximate solutions exhibit negligible loss in quality; in long-term simulations the proposed method reduces the average number of pallets needing transportation due to short-term demand to less than half the number observed in the data stream.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1060.0374","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution for logistics optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To facilitate shipment consolidation and capacity planning, we assume that the system has implemented fixed replenishment intervals; each stage is allowed to order only at given equidistant times. Further, for each stage except the most downstream one, the replenishment interval is assumed to be an integer multiple of the replenishment interval of the next downstream stage. This reflects the fact that the further upstream in a supply chain, the higher setup times and costs tend to be, and thus larger batches are desired. Our model with fixed replenishment intervals is a direct generalization of the serial model of Clark and Scarf (1960). For this generalized model, we prove the optimality of base-stock policies, we derive newsboy equations for the optimal base-stock levels, and we describe an efficient exact solution procedure for the case with mixed Erlang demands.

We assume that the interarrival and service times are independent and identically distributed, that routing is probabilistic, and that the failure state of the system can be described by a Markov process that is independent of the other system dynamics. We find that the maximal capacity is tightly bounded by the solution of a linear programming problem and that the solution of this problem can be used to construct timed, generalized round-robin policies that approach the maximal capacity arbitrarily closely. We then give a series of structural results for our policies, including identifying when server flexibility can completely compensate for failures and when the implementation of our policies can be simplified.

A class of decision processes called multiarmed bandits has been previously deployed to develop optimal policies for Red, in which she attaches a calibrating (Gittins) index to each Blue target and optimally shoots next at the Blue with the largest index value. The current paper seeks to elucidate how a range of developments of index theory are able to accommodate features of such problems, which are of practical military import. Such features include levels of risk to Red that are policy dependent, Red having imperfect information about the Blues she faces, an evolving population of Blue targets, and the possibility of Red disengagement.

For the single-item system, customers' demand is stochastic. The inventory is controlled by a continuous-review (r, Q) policy. Goods are replenished to the inventory system with a constant lead time. An optimization problem with a storage-space constraint is formulated for computing a single-item (r, Q) policy that minimizes the long-run average system cost. Based on some existing results in the single-item (r, Q) policy without a storage-space constraint in the literature, useful structural properties of the optimization problem are attained. An efficient algorithm with polynomial time computational complexity is then proposed for obtaining the optimal solutions. For the multi-item system, each item possesses its particular customers' demand that is stochastic, its own (r, Q) policy that controls the inventory, and its individual lead time that is constant. An important issue in such inventory systems is the allocation of the storage space to the items and the values of r and Q for each item. We formulate an optimization problem with a storage-space constraint for multi-item (r, Q) policies.

S. 1958. Programming of economic lot sizes. Management Sci.4(2) 115\u2013135], provides a strong lower bound, it also has an important structural deficiency. Imposing integrality constraints on the columns in the master program will not necessarily give the optimal integer programming solution. Manne's model contains only production plans that satisfy the Wagner-Whitin property, and it is well known that the optimal solution to a capacitated lot-sizing problem will not necessarily satisfy this property. The first contribution of this paper answers the following question, unsolved for almost 50 years: If Manne's formulation is not equivalent to the original problem, what is then a correct reformulation? We develop an equivalent mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation to the original problem and show how this results from applying the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to the original MIP formulation. The set of extreme points of the lot-size polytope that are needed for this MIP Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is much larger than the set of dominant plans used by Manne. We further show how the integrality restrictions on the original setup variables translate into integrality restrictions on the new master variables by separating the setup and production decisions. Our new formulation gives the same lower bound as Manne's reformulation. Second, we develop a branch-and-price algorithm for the problem. Computational experiments are presented on data sets available from the literature. Column generation is accelerated by a combination of simplex and subgradient optimization for finding the dual prices. The results show that branch-and-price is computationally tractable and competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches found in the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0404","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical and mathematical approach to optimization problems without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In the former, the data is systematically changed to yield answers to queries that are statistically similar to those that would have resulted from the original data. The latter provides exact answers to queries as long as the risk of exact disclosure of confidential data does not become too great. We present a new methodology to combine these techniques so that the advantages of both are captured. The model is appropriate and computationally viable for large databases whether the queries are linear or nonlinear. The query restriction phase consists of finding an optimal subset of queries to answer exactly without compromising the database. This is an \ud835\udca9 \ud835\udcab-hard problem with a matroid intersection structure that lends itself to an efficient greedy heuristic. Then, given the queries that are answered exactly, we implement a data perturbation phase that provides stochastic protection and consistency.

We show that the structure of the optimal policy for a decision maker with exponential utility functions is almost identical to the structure of the optimal risk-neutral inventory (and pricing) policies. These structural results are extended to models in which the decision maker has access to a (partially) complete financial market and can hedge its operational risk through trading financial securities.

The key features of our model include balancing protection from terrorism and natural disasters, and describing the attacker choice by a continuous level of effort rather than a discrete choice (i.e., attack or not). Interestingly, in a sequential game, increased defensive investment can lead an attacker to either increase his level of effort (to help compensate for the reduced probability of damage from an attack), or decrease his level of effort (because attacking has become less profitable). This can either reduce or increase the effectiveness of investments in protection from intentional attack, and can therefore affect the relative desirability of investing in protection from natural disasters.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0434","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on game theory and resource allocation strategies related to terrorism and natural disasters, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The holding cost parameter is identical; however, the cost of a lost sale could be different from the per-period cost of backlogging a unit sale. When these costs are equal, we prove that the optimal expected cost for managing the system with lost sales is lower.

Consider an assembly system where suppliers provide parts to a manufacturer. A product cannot be delivered until all its parts have been supplied. The manufacturer performs nonbottleneck operations, for example, outsourced assembly, packaging, and delivery for each product. Two classical scheduling objectives are considered: minimization of the total completion time and of the maximum lateness. We analyze how far from optimal the best schedule for a suppliers' scheduling problem can be for the corresponding manufacturer's problem, and vice versa. To resolve these conflicts, we consider four alternative scenarios for the relative bargaining power of the suppliers and the manufacturer, and in each case describe a practical mechanism for cooperation between the decision makers. Evaluating the cost of conflict and the benefit of cooperation in these scenarios requires the solution of various scheduling problems by the suppliers, the manufacturer, and the overall system. For all these scheduling problems, we provide either an efficient algorithm or a proof of intractability. Moreover, for two problems that we show are intractable, we describe heuristics and analyze their worst case performance or demonstrate asymptotic optimality of their solutions. We demonstrate computationally that the cost saving realized by cooperation between the decision makers is significant in many cases. Extensions of our models to consider bottleneck operations at the manufacturer and transportation times are also developed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0412","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['conflict', 'cooperation', 'scheduling', 'bargaining power']","The article discusses conflict and cooperation in supply chain contexts, which touches on themes of negotiation and power dynamics.

No exact methods exist for the WTA problem that can solve even small-size problems (for example, with 20 weapons and 20 targets). Although several heuristic methods have been proposed to solve the WTA problem, due to the absence of exact methods, no estimates are available on the quality of solutions produced by such heuristics. In this paper, we suggest integer programming and network flow-based lower-bounding methods that we obtain using a branch-and-bound algorithm for the WTA problem. We also propose a network flow-based construction heuristic and a very large-scale neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithm. We present computational results of our algorithms, which indicate that we can solve moderately large instances (up to 80 weapons and 80 targets) of the WTA problem optimally and obtain almost optimal solutions of fairly large instances (up to 200 weapons and 200 targets) within a few seconds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0440","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in operations research related to defense applications, with no mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In line with theory-based arguments, our analysis suggests that the value of supply-side, demand-side, and spatial exploration and exploitation is contingent on the environment. While boundary-spanning supply-side search is found to be positively associated with innovation in more-dynamic environments typical of the entrepreneurial regime phase of technology evolution, such exploration appears to hurt innovation in less-dynamic environments. In a reverse fashion, while boundary-spanning demand-side search is found to be favorably associated with innovation in less-dynamic environments, it appears to harm innovation in a more-dynamic context.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two types of contractual provisions that are important in high-technology contracts, or contracts for which environmental uncertainty or technological complexity are significant, namely, contingency planning and task description. Previous research suggests that contracts can vary significantly in the degree of detail with which such key provisions are written, and that they are each subject to learning. In this paper, we find evidence from a sample of 386 contracts that contingency planning and task description behave as complements in contractual design. We argue that this complementarity reflects patterns of learning to contract. We also find that repeated exchange between two firms leads to greater effort at contingency planning in subsequent contracts, a finding that is also consistent with learning effects, but not with frequently made claims that contracts and trust are substitutes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0220","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['contractual provisions', 'contingency planning', 'task description']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of contract design in IT services without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although rigorous compliance with the standard often resulted in real improvements, these improvements were primarily technical and administrative in nature. However, in most of the cases studied, daily practices remained somewhat decoupled from the prescriptions of the ISO 14001 system, of which employees generally had only a vague understanding. The organizations studied adopted different strategies to reconcile external pressures in favour of adopting this standard and internal constraints associated with a management system whose support varied from one case to the next. While the standard often appeared to be some sort of \u201crational myth\u201d (Meyer and Rowan 1977) to which organizations superficially committed themselves, the adaptation to institutional pressures was not necessarily straightforward. Using the example of the ISO 14001 standard, our study helps to show how this myth can be integrated, transformed, and even created through rhetoric by organizations to resolve certain contradictions.

First, we explain individual use, group resistance, and organizational adoption with models situated at the same level of analysis as each outcome. At the individual level, we use a model of cognitive absorption to explain individual system usage. At the group level, the political variant of interaction theory is used to explain group resistance to IS implementation. At the organizational level, we use organizational configurations to explain IS adoption in terms of emergence and routinization. We identify each model\u2019s limits and prediction failures, and we show that using alternate models helps to remedy a model\u2019s prediction failures and overcome its limits. Finally, we propose an alternate-template theory of IS implementation outcomes that takes into account all three levels of analysis, their respective outcomes, and the time dimension.

How Bureaucracy Enables Temporal Flexibility for Professional Service Workers","This paper develops a model of how organizations influence the temporal flexibility of professional service workers. The model starts by identifying a key source of temporal inflexibility for these workers: an inability to hand clients off among one other. Hand-offs are impeded by high levels of client-to-worker specificity, stemming from three common characteristics of professional service work. The organizational processes that reduce that specificity, and therefore facilitate hand-offs, function by (a) reshaping client participation and expectations about the nature of their service interactions, (b) partly standardizing client-related work practices, and (c) facilitating the sharing of knowledge about clients between workers. The presence of these organizational processes represents greater bureaucracy\u2014an interesting twist, given that they create more temporal flexibility for workers. The model is grounded in field research conducted with primary care physicians, and is also evaluated using a unique survey data set of physician organizations. Implications are drawn for the study of temporal flexibility across professional services in general, as well as for recent attempts to rethink the meaning of bureaucracy for workers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0226","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['bureaucracy', 'flexibility', 'professional service workers']","The article discusses organizational processes and their impact on professional service workers, touching on themes of flexibility and bureaucracy.

Training attitudes of people in 16 European (EU) countries/regions are examined using data from the 1995 Eurobarometer Training Survey.

Technological Change, Product Form Design, and Perceptions of Value for Product Innovations","Innovation researchers recognize that the uncertainty with regard to the value-creating potential of product innovations increases with their technological novelty, and have argued that the usefulness and value of novel products are socially constructed. Despite this recognition, researchers have not explored how the outer form in which a technological innovation is embodied influences the processes through which the innovation\u2019s value is constructed and perceived. In this paper we argue that by embodying novel technologies in objects with specific functional, symbolic, and aesthetic properties, innovating firms also endow their products with cues that trigger a variety of cognitive and emotional responses. Drawing on psychological research we articulate how such cognitive and emotional responses underlie initial perceptions of value and theorize how innovating firms can influence them through product form design. Our framework explains how product form contributes to perceptions of value by modulating the actual technological novelty of a product innovation and facilitating how customers cope with it. Our theoretical framework makes an important contribution to innovation research and practice because it articulates how product form can be used strategically to achieve specific cognitive and emotional effects and enhance the initial customer perceptions of the value of an innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0233","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['innovation', 'value', 'socially constructed']","The article discusses how perceptions of value for innovations are socially constructed, which hints at a recognition of social factors influencing business.

One of these problems is the higher risk of misunderstandings. Current communication theories suggest that misunderstanding may be reduced by contextualization, i.e., providing contextual information to explain a core message. However, we hypothesize that contextualization is beneficial in some situations but not in others. Treating contextualization as a form of adaptive behavior, we propose a model for understanding its contingent impact on performance in collaborative tasks. We explain the motivation for contextualization and argue that it can be predicted by the extent to which the perspectives of the collaborators are different or shared: A difference of perspectives between collaborators motivates them to contextualize to increase mutual understanding (MU) and thereby increase performance. Computer support should also motivate communicators to contextualize by making it easier for them to do so. A controlled experiment tests these relationships in a collaborative machine-assembly task performed by dyads. We manipulate the collaborators\u2019 perspectives and the level of computer support, and we measure contextualization behavior, MU, and performance. Results show that contextualization is effective only for dyads with different perspectives and may be detrimental when perspectives are similar.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1060.0237","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['contextualization', 'collaboration', 'misunderstanding']","The article discusses contextualization in communication, which can relate to understanding diverse perspectives, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of collaboration rather than social justice or equity themes.

Consistent with the norms of an engineering culture, we find that future leaders must first make strong technical contributions. Beyond technical contributions, they must then integrate their communities in order to mobilize volunteers and avoid the ever-present danger of forking and balkanization. This is enabled by two correlated but distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary spanning between technological areas. An inherent lack of trust associated with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction. Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much more likely than brokers to advance to leadership. The research separates the influence of human and social capital on promotion, and highlights previously unexamined differences between brokerage- and boundary-spanning positions.

Each year members of various types of seasonal organizations, such as summer camps and ski areas, come together to bring these organizations \u201cback to life\u201d after many months of dormancy. Because many staff members are new and other conditions vary, the result of this regeneration process is necessarily different from the previous year\u2019s organization, but it is nonetheless recognizable to repeat clientele as a familiar instance of \u201cthe same\u201d organization. We use this rarely examined process of regeneration to explore the question of how we can regard an organization as being the same entity over time. We suggest that this sameness stems from a coherence and similarity of actions at the organizational level that is analogous to the psychological notion of individual character. Just as individual habits cohere in the character of an individual and allow us to recognize and predict future behavior, we argue that organizations are systems of interacting dispositions to act in a particular way. It is the mutually adapted content of this ensemble of action dispositions that constitutes what we present here as organizational character. We argue that such an ensemble of dispositions is coherent, persistent, and necessary for seasonal regeneration. This work contributes to an ongoing discussion of organizational action and similarity over time. Our focus on regenerative processes in a seasonal organization provides a distinct and informative perspective on these issues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0248","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['regeneration', 'organizational character', 'seasonal organizations']","The article discusses organizational regeneration and character, which touches on themes of organizational behavior and continuity but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity.

In our simulations, firms search locally in a two-dimensional fitness landscape, choosing moves in a way that responds both to local payoff considerations and to a more global sense of opportunity represented by a firm-specific preferred direction. The latter concept provides a simple device for introducing cognitive or motivational considerations into the formal account of search behavior, alongside payoff considerations. After describing the objectives and the structure of the model, we report a first experiment that explores how the ruggedness of the landscape affects the interplay of local payoff and cognitive considerations (preferred direction) in search. We show that an intermediate search strategy, combining the guidance of local search with a moderate level of nonlocal obsession, is distinctly advantageous in searching a rugged landscape. We also explore the effects of other considerations, including the objective validity of the preferred direction and the degree of dispersion of firm strategies. We conclude by noting available features of the model that are not exercised in this experiment.

Decision making has given way to learning, routines, and an increased focus on change and adaptation; the organizational level of analysis, although frequently invoked, has been largely supplanted by either a more micro or a more macro focus. In this paper, we argue for restoring the School\u2019s original mission and perspective. Our proposal for how this overarching goal can be achieved encompasses three central points. First, we believe the School needs to resurrect a few select ideas that, despite their fundamental importance, have been neglected over time. Second, we believe there is a need for greater paradigmatic closure amongst the School\u2019s central theoretical pillars. Loose coupling among such pillars might keep key insights on organizational decision making from emerging. Finally, there is the need to incorporate major developments that have been generated post-Carnegie School, both within organization theory and in the behavioral and social sciences more broadly. In particular, we point to the shift to more open systems perspectives on organizations, the conceptions of organizations being embedded in larger social contexts, and recent developments in the study of individual cognition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0277","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['decision-making', 'social contexts', 'organizational theory']","The article discusses the need to incorporate broader social contexts and emphasizes decision-making within organizations, which aligns with moderate woke themes of social awareness and organizational ethics.

This escalation was driven by fragmented, piecemeal reactions resulting from the organizational structure of the Greek administration, which shaped identities, defined repertoires of action, sustained routines, and filtered and interpreted information. The division of labor inevitably imposed local responses that were not well calibrated. More importantly, the escalation was driven by a lack of hierarchical intervention, which was due to the conditions at the time. Drawing on this case as a natural experiment, the paper highlights the threefold role of hierarchy, which consists of devising means to structure attention and identify how problems are perceived and responded to; control and rein in routinized responses through exception management in the realm of actions; and helping to reframe problems by performing exception management at the level of cognition. In our case study, the hierarchy failed resulting in the issue being poorly framed, responses being local and disaggregated, and each partial reaction worsening the problem, leading to an escalation. This paper articulates a potential raison d\u2019\u00eatre for hierarchy, and considers the conditions that allow it to play its role to the full.

In the spirit of Cyert and March (1963), we aim for a perspective that reflects the reality of managerial behavior, that respects both the reasoning power of managers and the bounds on their rationality, and that permits organizations to change but within realistic limits. Our perspective employs the variable time to frame the question of strategy\u2019s origins in a distinctive way. Over time, the cognitive and physical elements that make up a strategy become less plastic, while mechanisms to search rationally for a strategy become more available. This generates a fundamental tension in the origin of strategy: Managers struggle to understand their environment well enough to search rationally for an effective strategy before their firms lose the plasticity necessary to exploit that understanding. A focus on time allows us to synthesize and extend the evolutionary and positioning models of strategic search. Toward this end, we couple induction and deduction. The inductive part of the paper uses detailed observation of the search for a strategy at one firm to identify constructs that play a crucial role in strategic search. The deductive part steps beyond our focal firm and uses these constructs to derive theoretical propositions about the typical path of strategic search and the mortality associated with different approaches to search.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0282","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial behavior and strategic search without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we develop an agent-based computational model of this process, in which the agents in the population are heterogeneous in their abilities to innovate and imitate. The model incorporates three primary forces: the discovery of new ideas, the observation and adoption of these ideas, and the endogenous development of networks. The objective is to explore the evolving architecture of problem-solving networks and the critical roles that different agents play in the process. A central finding is that the emergent network takes a chain structure with innovators (those most skilled at generating new ideas) being the main source of ideas and those most skilled at imitating acting as connectors between the innovators and the masses.

Epistemic Communities and the Geography of Research and Patenting in Biotechnology","The spatial clustering of innovation has been associated with localized knowledge flows among small, knowledge-intensive firms, but knowledge flows may extend beyond regional boundaries through the participation of firm employees in broader knowledge-based communities. This paper analyzes biotechnology firms jointly engaged in technological innovation and open scientific research and proposes that the geography of their collaborations should reflect the distinctive social logics of these activities. I hypothesize that projects involving local ties are more likely to be patented by a firm than are projects involving distant contacts, both because proximity is conducive to innovation and because a small firm\u2019s social capital is likely to be greatest in its home region. However, classic studies in the sociology of science show that scientific communities are socially stratified and geographically dispersed. As a result, I hypothesize that ties to distant partners and prestige in scientific communities are positively associated with scientific impact but negatively associated with firm patenting. The analysis focuses on 5,143 collaborative research papers published by a large sample of small biotechnology firms. The average distance among coauthors on a paper is some 1,500 miles, indicating that the firms are engaged in geographically far-flung research networks; however, the distribution of teams in space is strongly bimodal, revealing an important core of regional ties alongside a set of much more distant ties. Regression analysis show that the spatially clustered teams are more likely to publish papers that are subsequently cited in the authoring firms\u2019 patents, whereas teams that are globally dispersed produce papers that are more highly cited in the scientific literature, but less cited in the authoring firms\u2019 patents. Status in the scientific community has the expected positive effects on paper citations, but a negative effect on patent citations. The results give evidence of different\u2014and in some respects conflicting\u2014logics governing the creation of new technologies on the one hand and valuable ideas in science on the other, highlighting challenges faced by firms that aim to profit from knowledge created in open scientific communities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0249","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['social capital', 'scientific communities', 'innovation', 'geography', 'collaboration']","The article discusses the social dynamics of knowledge flows and the stratification within scientific communities, indicating a moderate focus on social factors influencing innovation.

We examine the knowledge-integration problem in geographically dispersed professional organizations in which experts work in project teams. From consideration of coordination costs and local ties, we argue that (1) the organization will develop specialized expertise within local sites, (2) managers avoid crossing geographic boundaries to staff a project unless bringing on a distant expert helps meet customer requirements, (3) cross-site connections help less-needed members participate in dispersed projects, and (4) dispersed projects that have a better match of expertise generate higher net earnings. We tested these hypotheses using archival data and interviews in a geographically dispersed professional service organization. We examined how managers staffed 493 local and dispersed projects over a five-year period, and the financial outcomes of these projects. Managers created dispersed projects comparatively rarely; they did so when scarce expertise from other sites was needed to match customers\u2019 project requirements. Dispersed projects garnered higher net earnings than local projects when there was a better match of scarce expertise to project requirements. However, a curvilinear relationship was observed, such that a very high percentage of dispersed experts on a project increased coordination costs and reduced net earnings. Our study extends the knowledge-based view by showing how considerations of coordination costs and social ties affect knowledge integration in the geographically dispersed organization. The study also shows, empirically, the managerial trade-offs that encourage or discourage dispersed collaboration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0263","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['expertise', 'collaboration', 'geographically dispersed']","The article discusses collaboration and expertise within geographically dispersed organizations, which hints at some level of social dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Specifically, we suggest that firms develop unique assumptions, social networks, and feedback mechanisms; that these mechanisms perpetuate patterns of changes in collective beliefs and aggregate actions; and that these patterns in turn shape high- and low-velocity conditions. We examine these assertions by tracing the collective beliefs of three aircraft (low-velocity) and semiconductor (high-velocity) firms over a 20-year period (1977\u20131997).

In this paper, we theorize how task and team familiarity interact with task and team coordination complexity to influence team performance. We posit that task familiarity is more beneficial with more complex tasks (i.e., tasks that are larger or with more complex structures) and that team familiarity is more beneficial when team coordination is more difficult (i.e., for larger or geographically dispersed teams). Finally, we propose that the effects of task familiarity and team familiarity on team performance are complementary. Based on a field study of geographically distributed software teams, two of our hypotheses are disconfirmed: Our results show that the beneficial effects of task familiarity decline when tasks are more structurally complex and are independent of task size. Conversely, the hypotheses for team familiarity are confirmed as the benefit of team familiarity for team performance is enhanced when team coordination is more challenging\u2014i.e., when teams are larger or geographically dispersed. Finally, surprisingly, we find that task and team familiarity are more substitutive than complementary in their joint effects on team performance: Task familiarity improves team performance more strongly when team familiarity is weak and vice versa.

Together, these multiple wakes of innovation produce a complex landscape of innovations with unpredictable peaks and valleys. Gehry\u2019s adoption of digital 3-D representations disturbed the ecology of interactions and stimulated innovations in his project networks by: providing path-creating innovation trajectories in separate communities of practice, creating trading zones where communities could create knowledge about diverse innovations, and offering a means for intercalating innovations across heterogeneous communities.

It begins by proposing that the relationship between technology appropriations and an organization's informal advice networks is one useful way to understand how the information that is created, modified, transmitted, and stored through the use of IT can lead to organizational change. I then present the findings of an ethnographic study of the implementation and use of a new information technology service management (ITSM) tool in a large IT organization. The findings show that a number of discrepant events led technicians to appropriate the material features of the technology in certain ways, thus providing them with new and different kinds of information than was available to them previously. Armed with such information, technicians began to seek advice differently than they had before, which led to an overall transformation in the organization's social structure. I characterize appropriations of a technology's features as a set of practices that activate the informational capabilities of a new technology through advice networks. In activating its informational capabilities, technicians transformed the potential that the technology had to create, modify, transmit, and store information in new ways into resources used to organize their work.

We argue that the specific influence of IT on firm boundaries depends on the broader industrial context. We investigate conditions whereby IT investments enable industries to be more loosely coupled through alliance formation and the use of contingent workers. We use transaction cost and modular systems theory to ground our theoretical development. The extent to which industrywide IT investment is associated with loosely coupled organizational forms depends on (1) limited asset specificity because of industry standards, (2) the level of industry uncertainty resulting from technological change, and (3) the overall complexity of the industry in terms of diverse inputs. Specifically, when industry standards exist, IT investment leads to greater use of both alliances and contingent workers. IT investment has a stronger positive relationship with the use of contingent workers when levels of technological change are low as compared to when levels of technological change are high. When there are high levels of input diversity and industry standards exist, IT investment led to an increased use of contingent workers. Our analyses provides a more refined view of IT influence on firm boundaries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0285","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['coordination', 'contingent workers', 'organizational forms']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of information technology and its impact on organizational structures without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we propose a new theory of technology-mediated organizational change that bridges these two extremes. Using grounded theory methodology, we conducted a three-year study of an enterprise system implementation. From the data collected, we identified embeddedness as central to the process of change. When embedded in technology, organizational elements such as routines and roles acquire a material aspect, in addition to the ostensive and performative aspects identified by Feldman and Pentland (2003). Our new theory employs the lens of critical realism because in our view, common constructivist perspectives such as structuration theory or actor network theory have limited our understanding of technology as a mediator of organizational change. Using a critical realist perspective, our theory explains the process of change as a three-stage cycle in which the ostensive, performative, and material aspects of organizational elements interact differently in each stage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0288","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['human agency', 'organizational change', 'critical realism']","The article discusses the interplay between technology and human agency in organizational change, which reflects a moderate engagement with themes of ethics and social interaction.

We explore two organizational explanations for this variation: differences in firms' IT investment allocations and their IT capabilities. We develop a theoretical model of IT resources, defined as the combination of specific IT assets and organizational IT capabilities. We argue that investments into different IT assets are guided by firms' strategies (e.g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per IT dollar through a mutually reinforcing system of organizational IT capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies. Empirically, we test the impact of IT assets, IT capabilities, and their combination on four dimensions of firm performance: market valuation, profitability, cost, and innovation. Our results\u2014based on data on IT investment allocations and IT capabilities in 147 U.S. firms from 1999 to 2002\u2014demonstrate that IT investment allocations and organizational IT capabilities drive differences in firm performance. Firms' total IT investment is not associated with performance, but investments in specific IT assets explain performance differences along dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. In addition, a system of organizational IT capabilities strengthens the performance effects of IT assets and broadens their impact beyond their intended purpose. The results help explain variance in returns to IT capital across firms and expand our understanding of alignment between IT and organizations.

However, organization science's interest in this relationship has declined significantly over the past 30 years, a period during which information technologies have become pervasive in organizations and brought about significant changes in them. Organizing no longer needs to take place around hierarchy and the collection, storage, and distribution of information as was the case with \u201ccommand and control\u201d bureaucracies in the past. The adoption of innovations in information technology (IT) and organizational practices since the 1990s now make it possible to organize around what can be done with information.

Thus, we challenge two assumptions common in prior research: (1) that significant variance exists at the focal level of analysis, whereas other levels of analysis are assumed to be homogeneous, and (2) that the focal level of analysis is independent from other levels of analysis. Accordingly, we advance a set of hypotheses to simultaneously assess the direct effects of antecedents at the individual, firm, and network levels on innovation output. We then investigate whether a firm's antecedents to innovation lie across different levels. To accomplish this, we propose two competing interaction hypotheses. We juxtapose the hypothesis that the individual-, firm-, and network-level antecedents to innovation are substitutes versus the proposition that these innovation mechanisms are complements. We test our multilevel theoretical model using an unusually comprehensive and detailed panel data set that documents the innovation attempts of global pharmaceutical companies within biotechnology over a 22-year time period (1980\u20132001). We find evidence that the antecedents to innovation lie across different levels of analysis and can have compensating or reinforcing effects on firm-level innovative output.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0291","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'individual', 'firm', 'network']","The article primarily focuses on innovation and the dynamics of capabilities across different levels of analysis without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize that firm-patenting output depends not only on research and development (R&D) resources, but also on the patent law expertise combined with R&D inside the firm. We predict that the specialization of this in-house legal resource to R&D enables firms to identify patentable inventions more effectively and to convert them into patents. We also argue that there may be a positive complementary relationship between patent law expertise and R&D, such that patent law expertise will have a larger effect on patent output when it is deployed with matching higher levels of R&D. Furthermore, we predict that the effect of internal patent law expertise on firm patenting will be moderated by organization- and industry-level contextual factors. To test our hypotheses, we examine the patenting performance of a sample of Fortune 500 firms from 1990 to 2000. Results suggest that in-house patent law expertise is a significant predictor of firm-patenting performance; furthermore, this effect is moderated by the firm's level of top management team (TMT) patent law background and industry-patenting pressures. However, our hypothesis of a complementary relationship between patent law expertise and R&D was not supported; instead, we found evidence of a counterintuitive (weak) negative interaction between these two variables. Our findings shed light on how the combination of other resources with R&D affects firm-patenting performance, and advance the integration of complementary organizational perspectives with the RBV.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0292","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of patent law and R&D performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We adopt a qualitative approach to guide the development of grounded theory across multiple levels of analysis, including the industry (consisting of multiple actors), organizational, and individual creator levels. Our study shows that business and production interests currently drive the rationalization of video game production. There is a maturing trend, with product designs becoming well established as genres, and consumers and publishers desiring incrementally innovative games. This leads publishers to focus on acquiring intellectual property, and publishers and studios alike to make incrementally innovative sequels. The increasing complexity of products leads to further rationalization in their development. However, the need to satisfy consumers' continually evolving tastes and game developers' inclinations to be creative also creates tensions with these rational forces. Different actors balance these tensions differently. Studios may seek to balance these by shifting between more and less innovative products, by creating original intellectual property to increase their bargaining power with publishers, and by iterating and repositioning products during development to adapt them to the market. Publishers may enhance their portfolio by hiring highly creative designers into their stable. New products are created through combinative creativity, that is, the recombination of existing ideas from different sources into new products. The connection of combinative mechanisms with the balancing behavior at the firm level provides a means for understanding the evolution of innovative products and, therefore, industries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0299","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['creativity', 'tensions', 'innovation']","The article discusses the balance between rationalization and creativity in the video game industry, touching on the need for innovation and the evolving tastes of consumers.

We propose a framework arguing that three conditions shape this context: disclosure, access, and rewards.

Analyzing these systems is not straightforward, because standard queueing theory focuses on the long\u2010run steady\u2010state behavior of stationary models. We show how to adapt stationary queueing models for use in nonstationary environments so that time\u2010dependent performance is captured and staffing requirements can be set. Relatively little modification of straightforward stationary analysis applies in systems where service times are short and the targeted quality of service is high. When service times are moderate and the targeted quality of service is still high, time\u2010lag refinements can improve traditional stationary independent period\u2010by\u2010period and peak\u2010hour approximations. Time\u2010varying infinite\u2010server models help develop refinements, because closed\u2010form expressions exist for their time\u2010dependent behavior. More difficult cases with very long service times and other complicated features, such as end\u2010of\u2010day effects, can often be treated by a modified\u2010offered\u2010load approximation, which is based on an associated infinite\u2010server model.

To contribute to a better understanding of this situation, we consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer.

To motivate the problem, we use as a setting a high\u2010tech manufacturing company that operates in a competitive environment, is not a leader in the industry, and is constantly reacting to bundles introduced by the leader. Bundles are sets of components that must meet technical constraints. The company's objective is to build a bundle and offer it in a market where it will compete with other bundles. Consumers purchase the bundle that maximizes their utility after examining all available bundles. The company selection of the bundle's components and its price is made in light of the bundles against which it will be competing and the uncertainty in the consumer choice process. The optimal decision could be found by solving a nonlinear mixed integer program, which is difficult to solve. Instead, we propose an efficient solution procedure to determine the optimal composition of the bundle and the price at which it should be offered.

The company traditionally offered speed\u2010of\u2010service pricing to its customers, but without day\u2010of\u2010week differentiation, resulting in customer demands with considerable day\u2010of\u2010week seasonality. The package delivery company hoped that using day\u2010of\u2010week and speed\u2010of\u2010service price differentiation for contract customers would induce these customers to adjust their demands to become counter\u2010cyclical to the non\u2010contract demand.

The contract provides the lowest\u2010cost arrangement for the package delivery company while ensuring that the customer is at least as well off as he would have been under the existing pricing structure. The contract pricing smoothes the package delivery company's demand and reduces peak requirements for transport capacity. The latter helps to decrease capital costs, which may allow a further price reduction for the customer. We formulate the pricing problem as a biconvex optimization model, and present a methodology for designing the contract and numerical examples that illustrate the achievable savings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00169.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and contract structuring in package delivery services without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

In our capacity game model, a monopolistic supplier has to build capacity before observing the uncertain demand. The demand is generated by two potential customers, who privately know their own types. The types could be either high or low, differing in willingness to pay for each unit of demand. To discriminate between the customer types, the supplier designs option contracts so that only the high type will buy options in advance. The high type will do so because the options can hedge their risk of demand loss when capacity is tight. The supplier profits in three ways. First, the high type customers pay higher marginal prices on average. Second, the high type customers' demand is satisfied as a first priority, guaranteeing allocation efficiency. Third, the supplier can observe the number of options being purchased and so determine customer types, improving capacity investment efficiency. We compare our results to those of classical second degree price discrimination. We show that our proposed framework guarantees the same level of supplier profit even when the supplier cannot discriminate between the customers by bundling products.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00170.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price discrimination and capacity management without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The notion of relative prices motivates us to consider a situation in which a retailer would either charge the same retail price for all products if he adopts a \u2018fixed\u2019 pricing strategy or charge different prices for different products if he adopts a \u2018variable\u2019 pricing strategy. In this paper, we develop a base model with deterministic demand that is intended to examine how a retailer should jointly determine the order quantity and the retail price of two substitutable products under the fixed and variable pricing strategies. Our analysis indicates that the optimal retail price under the variable pricing strategy is equal to the optimal retail price under the fixed pricing strategy plus or minus an adjustment term. This adjustment term depends on product substitutability and price sensitivity. We also present two different extensions of our base model. In the first extension, our analysis indicates that the underlying structure of the optimal retail price and order quantity is preserved when there is a limit on the total order quantity. The second extension deals with the issue of retail competition. Relative to the base case, we show that the underlying structure of the optimal retail price and order quantity is preserved in a duopolistic environment.

Socio\u2010technical theory suggests that internal organizational resources based on a foundation of ERP technology may be the true drivers of ERP benefits.

Survey data from North American manufacturing firms that have implemented ERP systems demonstrate that ERP adopters seeking operational performance improvements are likely to realize these benefits. On the other hand, those seeking external market and supply chain performance improvements must first establish a foundation of internal operational performance improvements before customer satisfaction and supply chain benefits can be realized.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00176.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and its impact on competitive advantage without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Since customer service representatives (agents) have different call\u2010handling abilities and are typically cross\u2010trained in multiple skills, contact centers exploit skill\u2010based routing (SBR) to assign calls to appropriate agents, aiming to respond properly as well as promptly. Established agent\u2010staffing and SBR algorithms ensure that agents have the required call\u2010handling skills and that call routing is performed so that constraints are met for standard congestion measures, such as the percentage of calls of each type that abandon before starting service and the percentage of answered calls of each type that are delayed more than a specified number of seconds. We propose going beyond traditional congestion measures to focus on the expected value derived from having particular agents handle various calls. Expected value might represent expected revenue or the likelihood of first\u2010call resolution. Value might also reflect agent call\u2010handling preferences. We show how value\u2010based routing (VBR) and preference\u2010based routing (PBR) can be introduced in the context of an existing SBR framework, based on static\u2010priority routing using a highly\u2010structured priority matrix, so that constraints are still met for standard congestion measures. Since an existing SBR framework is used to implement VBR and PBR, it is not necessary to replace the automatic call distributor (ACD).

We select the priority matrix to use during a specified time interval (e.g., 30\u2010minute period) by maximizing the total expected value over that time interval, subject to staffing constraints.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00259.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of call routing and staffing in customer contact centers, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An etailer may sell its product not only through its online and bricks\u2010and\u2010mortar stores, but also through the websites of one or more third parties (e.g., Yahoo.com).

Only a fraction of such clicks lead to actual sales. The extra cost that is associated with shoppers who first click through to the third\u2010party websites makes them less attractive as customers than those who directly visit the etailer's online store.

By doing so, however, the firm subjects sales of its new product to competition from the leftover product. We present a two period model that captures the effect of this competition on the firm's production and pricing decisions. We characterize the firm's optimal strategy and find conditions under which the firm is better off carrying all, some, or none of its leftover inventory. We also show that, compared to a firm that acts myopically in the first period, a firm that takes into account the effect of first period decisions on second period profits will price its new product higher and stock more of it in the first period.

We demonstrate that the optimal assortment contains the few items that have the highest profit rate. When the store traffic is discrete, the optimal solution is difficult to obtain.

As elements are created, certain parts of the system (referred to as \u201cgroups\u201d) become functional and provide value, even though the entire system has not been completed. The main tradeoff in the sequencing problem arises from elements that belong to multiple groups. On the one hand, creating groups with common elements early in the project reduces the effort required to build later functionality that uses these elements. On the other hand, the early creation of such groups can delay the release of some critical functionality. We formulate the element sequencing problem and propose a heuristic to solve it. This heuristic is compared against a lower bound developed for the problem. Next, we study a more general version of the element sequencing problem in which an element requires some effort to be made reusable. When a reusable element is used in another group, some more effort is needed to specialize the element to work as desired in that group. We study reuse decisions under a weighted completion time objective (i.e., the sum of the completion time of each group weighted by its value is minimized), and show how these decisions differ from those under a traditional makespan objective (i.e., only the final completion time of the project is minimized). A variety of analytical and numerical results are presented. The model is also implemented on data obtained from a real software project. A key finding of this work is that the optimal effort on reuse is never increased (typically lowered) when a weighted completion time objective is used. This finding has implications for managing reuse in projects in which user value influences the order in which functionality is created.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00266.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software project management, specifically on optimizing functionality and reuse without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In many situations, they have replaced negotiations for supplier selection and price setting. While they have often greatly reduced transaction costs and increased competition, they have also encountered problems and resistance from suppliers resenting their intrusion on cooperative supplier/buyer relationships. In response to these issues, procurement auctions have evolved in radical new directions. Buyers use business rules to limit adverse changes. Some procurement auctions allow bidders to offer variants in the specifications of products to be supplied. Most important, some suppliers are allowing bidders to bid on packages of items, not just individual items. This tends to change procurement auctions from zero\u2010sum fights over supplier profit margins to win\u2010win searches for synergies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00268.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['procurement', 'competition', 'supplier relationships']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of electronic auctions in procurement and their impact on transaction costs and competition, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In traditional optimization, a central authority is asked to solve a (computationally hard) optimization problem. In contrast, in distributed settings there are several agents, possibly equipped with private information that is not publicly known, and these agents must interact to derive a solution to the problem. Usually the agents have their individual preferences, which induces them to behave strategically to manipulate the resulting solution. Nevertheless, one is often interested in the global performance of such systems. The analysis of such distributed settings requires techniques from classical optimization, game theory, and economic theory. The paper therefore briefly introduces the most important of the underlying concepts and gives a selection of typical research questions and recent results, focusing on applications to machine scheduling problems.

In this paper, we study the effect of bidding competition, information asymmetry, reserve price, bid decrement, auction duration, and bidder type on buyer surplus. We collected field data on more than 700 online procurement auctions conducted by a leading auctioneer and involving procurement items worth millions of dollars. Consistent with the predictions of auction theory, the results indicate that bidding competition, reserve price, and information sharing affect buyer surplus. Unlike previous findings in the consumer\u2010to\u2010consumer context, we find that bid decrement and auction duration have no effect in B2B procurement auctions. Our results suggest that use of the rank\u2010bidding format increases buyer surplus when incumbent suppliers participate in the auction.

With the recent development of on\u2010line markets, auctions are becoming an increasingly popular procurement method. The emergence of Internet marketplaces makes auction participation much easier and more convenient, since no physical presence of bidders is required. In addition, bidders in on\u2010line auctions can easily switch their identities. Thus, it may very well happen that the bidders in an auction have very little, if any, prior knowledge about the distributions of other bidders' valuations. We are proposing an efficient distribution of collusive profit for second\u2010price sealed bid auctions in such an environment. Unlike some known mechanism, which balance the budget only in expectation, our approach (which we call Random k) balances the budget ex\u2010post.

However, when auctions are slow, as Internet auctions used for procurement often are, there are significant opportunity or monitoring costs to bidders, and the choice of the size of the jump bid becomes a strategic decision. We study the choice in the experimental laboratory by systematically varying the opportunity costs associated with fast bidding. When time is more valuable bidders respond by choosing larger jump bids. Surprisingly, the economic performance of the auction is not significantly affected.

We find that the use of an appropriate reserve price may significantly increase the seller's revenue, especially when the number of items for sale is relatively large compared to the number of participating bidders.

Revenue management in such markets calls for real\u2010time techniques to learn the demand and its dependence on both the price and the service level associated with the service offering. We assume firms reply on exploratory approaches for demand estimation, in which firms experiment with different service offerings in order to simultaneously learn the demand while doing business. Such exploration and learning process can be costly without supervision. As reported by Rothschild (Journal of Economic Theory, 9 185\u2010202, 1974), traditional Bayesian dynamic control approaches may conclude with suboptimal offerings. We propose a novel demand learning approach that is guaranteed to converge to the optimal offering. The approach combines simulated annealing algorithm with Bayesian learning. We further present intelligent techniques that adaptively reduce the effort of exploration on suboptimal service offerings so as to improve the long\u2010run average profit.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00290.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and demand estimation in e-services without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The forecasts are used to set booking limits for lower value customers to ensure an adequate supply for higher value customers. The very use of booking limits, however, constrains the historical demand data needed for an accurate forecast. Ignoring this interaction leads to substantial penalties in a firm's potential revenues. We review existing unconstraining methods and propose a new method that includes some attractive properties not found in the existing methods. We evaluate several of the common unconstraining methods against our proposed method by testing them on intentionally constrained simulated data. Results indicate our proposed method outperforms other methods in two of three data sets. We also test the revenue impact of our proposed method, expectation maximization (EM), and \u201cno unconstraining\u201d on actual booking data from a hotel/casino.

We validate this model empirically using cross\u2010sectional survey data from U.S. manufacturing plants. We find that some IT applications are more effective at enabling the outsourcing of business processes than others. For example, the implementation of enterprise management systems is associated with the outsourcing of both production and support processes, whereas operations management systems are not associated with the outsourcing of plant processes. Plants with a low\u2010cost outsourcing strategy are more likely to outsource support processes than plants with a competency\u2010focused outsourcing strategy. However, both cost\u2010 and competency\u2010based strategies have a positive and similar impact on the outsourcing of production processes. In terms of implications for plant performance, our findings indicate that the outsourcing of production and support processes is associated with higher gross margins. Although plant IT infrastructure is positively associated with favorable on\u2010time delivery rates, there is no positive association between the incidence of plant outsourcing and on\u2010time delivery rates. These results have implications for crafting plant\u2010level outsourcing strategies and for investments in IT systems to facilitate the outsourcing of business processes for enhanced plant performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2007.tb00293.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing strategies and IT applications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We model a three\u2010stage game in which firms invest in emissions abatement, participate in a share auction for permits, and produce output. We develop a methodology for a profit\u2010maximizing firm to derive its marginal value function for permits and translate this value function into an optimal bidding strategy in the auction. We analyze two end\u2010product market scenarios independent demands and Cournot competition. In both scenarios we find that changing the number of available permits influences abatement to a lesser extent in a dirty industry than in a cleaner one. In addition, abatement levels taper off with increasing industry dirtiness levels. In the presence of competition, firms in a relatively clean industry can, in fact, benefit from a reduction in the number of available permits.

To solve the model, I analytically derive the habit-wealth feasibility constraints and show that they depend on the worst possible path of future labor income and on the habit strength, but not on the probability of the worst income. When there is only a slim chance of a severe income shock, the model implies much more conservative portfolios. The model also predicts that for some low to moderately wealthy households, the portfolio share allocated to stocks increases with wealth. Because of this feature, the model can generate more conservative portfolios for younger than for middle-aged households. The effects of habits on portfolio choice are robust to income smoothing through borrowing or flexible labor supply. One controversial finding is that for high values of the habit strength parameter, usually required for the resolution of asset pricing puzzles in general equilibrium, the life-cycle model predicts counterfactually high wealth accumulation.

Using a model of multi-asset trading in which the three main channels of contagion through financial linkages in the literature (correlated information, correlated liquidity, and portfolio rebalancing) are ruled out by construction, I show that financial contagion can still be an equilibrium outcome when speculators receive heterogeneous fundamental information. Risk-neutral speculators trade strategically across many assets to mask their information advantage about one asset. Asymmetric sharing of information among them prevents rational market makers from learning about their individual signals and trades with sufficient accuracy. Incorrect cross-inference about terminal payoffs and contagion ensue.

Suppliers may act also as liquidity providers, insuring against liquidity shocks that could endanger the survival of their customer relationships. The relatively high implicit interest rates of trade credit are the result of insurance and default premiums that are amplified whenever suppliers face a relatively high cost of funds.

A present value model that matches the data shows that discount rate and short rate movements play a large role in explaining the variation in dividend yields.

We test whether trading activity depends upon the degree of liquidity trading, the mass of informed traders, and the extent of uncertainty and dispersion of opinion about fundamental values. We hypothesize that liquidity (or noise) trading depends both on a stock\u2019s visibility and on portfolio rebalancing needs triggered by past price performance. We use firm size, age, price, and the book-to-market ratio as proxies for a firm\u2019s visibility.

Earning volatility and absolute earning surprises proxy for uncertainty about fundamental values.

We find that funds close following a period of superior performance and abnormal fund inflows. Fund managers raise their fees when they close to compensate managers for losses in income due to the restrictions in size imposed by the fund closure decision. Managers reopen when fund size declines.

Introducing heterogeneous preference for skewness allows the model's investors, in equilibrium, to underdiversify. We find support for our model's three key implications using a dataset of 60,000 individual investor accounts. First, we document that the portfolio returns of underdiversified investors are substantially more positively skewed than those of diversified investors. Second, we show that the apparent mean-variance inefficiency of underdiversified investors can be largely explained by the fact that investors sacrifice mean-variance efficiency for higher skewness exposure. Furthermore, we show that idiosyncratic skewness, and not just coskewness, can impact equilibrium prices. Third, the underdiversification of investors does not appear to be coincidentally related to skewness. Stocks most often selected by underdiversified investors have substantially higher average skewness\u2014especially idiosyncratic skewness\u2014than stocks most often selected by diversified investors.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/20/4/1255/1617743","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of investor behavior and asset management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

And yet, entrepreneurs' incentives may be improved, because projects funded by investors with \u201cshallow pockets\u201d must have not only a positive net present value at the refinancing stage, but one that is higher than that of competing portfolio projects.

Shareholder control is associated with higher (lower) yields if the firm is exposed to (protected from) takeovers. In the presence of shareholder control, the difference in bond yields due to differences in takeover vulnerability can be as high as 66 basis points. Second, event risk covenants reduce the credit risk associated with strong shareholder governance.

Flexible bank debt offers a superior trade-off between tax shields and bankruptcy costs. Ease of renegotiation limits bank debt capacity, however. Optimal debt structure hinges upon which party has bargaining power in private workouts. Weak firms have high bank debt capacity and utilize bank debt exclusively. Strong firms lever up to their (lower) bank debt capacity, augment with market debt, and place the bank senior. Therefore, the trade-off theory offers an explanation for: (i) why young/small firms use bank debt exclusively; (ii) why large/mature firms employ mixed debt financing; and (iii) why bank debt is senior. The trade-off theory also generates predictions consistent with international evidence. In countries in which the bankruptcy regime entails soft (tough) enforcement of contractual priority, bank debt capacity is low (high), implying greater (less) reliance on market debt.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/20/5/1389/1590790","article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt structure and financial theory without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Such gambling entails either an increase or a decrease in the volatility of the manager's portfolio, depending on her risk tolerance. In the latter case, the manager reduces her holdings of the risky asset despite its positive risk premium.

The risk factors are assumed to follow a discrete-time Gaussian process, and regime shifts are governed by a discrete-time Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities. This model gives closed-form solutions for zero-coupon bond prices, an analytic representation of the likelihood function for bond yields, and a natural decomposition of expected excess returns to components corresponding to regime-shift and factor risks. Using monthly data on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond yields, we show a critical role of priced, state-dependent regime-shift risks in capturing the time variations in expected excess returns, and document notable differences in the behaviors of the factor risk component of the expected returns across high and low volatility regimes. Additionally, the state dependence of the regime-switching probabilities is shown to capture an interesting asymmetry in the cyclical behavior of interest rates. The shapes of the term structure of volatility of bond yield changes are also very different across regimes, with the well-known hump being largely a low-volatility regime phenomenon.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/20/5/1669/1592122","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model related to U.S. Treasury bond yields without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Building on transaction cost and information-processing theories, we develop the hypothesis that opportunism increases to cope with industry structural instability, information unverifiability, and law unenforceability, the three interrelated yet distinct characteristics that jointly describe environmental volatility in an emerging economy. Our analysis of 188 foreign joint ventures in an emerging market suggests that opportunism increases with information unverifiability and law unenforceability. These relationships are even stronger when joint ventures depend more on the host country environment, but weaker when joint ventures operate in faster-growing industries. Finally, opportunism is found to play a mediating role in the relationship between environmental volatility and joint venture performance.

Despite the apparent importance of complementary assets for the understanding of corporate strategy, their creation and the associated managerial problems have been much less discussed. We believe this to be a major weakness in the strategic theory of the firm. Interestingly, problems of coordination and cooperation are center stage in the contract-based theories of the firm, and we try to integrate some of their insights into a resource-based perspective. Specifically, we show how complementary assets raise the need for strategic direction by a firm's top management. Moreover, complementary assets magnify internal incentive problems, and their management has an impact on the innovativeness of a firm. Lastly, complementary assets play a crucial role in the internal appropriation of innovative rents. We demonstrate the fruitfulness of our integrated framework by relating some of our findings to the literature on corporate strategy, industry evolution, and organizational structures.

Linking network theory to market entry research, I analyze the pattern in the structure, relation, and composition of 517 firms' strategic alliances as the firms face the decision of whether and when to enter the networking switches market over a 13-year period from 1989 to 2001. The context for empirical testing is the voice/data convergence between telephony communications and computer networking technologies during which the industry boundary blurs. Firms that have access to information of high quality, large quantity, and compositional heterogeneity are likely to enter the newly developed market more quickly. However, network configuration lock-in and network costs may counterbalance the benefits derived from network resources. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on social networks and the timing of market entry.

The impact of business scale and scope on long-term business survival, while controlling for profitability","Empirical research shows that larger businesses tend to survive longer than smaller companies. Little research, though, shows whether size confers survival advantages in addition to the survival benefits of baseline profitability. Moreover, no prior research attempts to disentangle the benefits of organizational capital that accrue from greater scale from those that arise from greater business scope. Thus, we lack a conceptual understanding of the underlying benefits of business size for long-term survival. We expect business scale and business scope to reflect organizational capital that offers survival benefits, where we conceptualize scale in terms of annual sales revenue and scope in terms of product line breadth and sub-sector participation within a related business context. We first argue that greater business scale and business scope each enhance long-term survival, independent of baseline profitability, owing to greater availability of financial resources, organizational routines, and external ties. We then argue that the benefits of scale are greatest for multi-product businesses, stemming from positive interactive effects of breadth and depth. We find support for these hypotheses with data from 618 firms that operated in the U.S. medical sector between 1978 and 1995.

In this paper, we show that an alliance learning process that involves articulation, codification, sharing, and internalization of alliance management know-how is positively related to a firm's overall alliance success. Prior research has found that firms with a dedicated alliance function, which oversees and coordinates a firm's overall alliance activity, have greater alliance success. In this paper we suggest that such an alliance function is also positively related to a firm's alliance learning process, and that process partly mediates the relationship between the alliance function and alliance success observed in prior work. This implies that the alliance learning process acts as one of the main mechanisms through which the alliance function leads to greater alliance success. Our paper extends prior alliance research by taking a first step in opening up the \u2018black box\u2019 between the alliance function and a firm's alliance success. We use survey data from a large sample of U.S.-based firms and their alliances to test our theoretical arguments. Although we only examine the alliance learning process and its relationship with firm-level alliance success, we also make an important contribution to research on the knowledge-based view of the firm and dynamic capabilities of firms in general by conceptualizing this learning process and its key aspects, and by empirically validating its impact on performance.

The success of international corporate diversification depends on a firm's capability to transfer knowledge to its subsidiaries, and how its local subsidiaries effectively utilize that knowledge. As knowledge resources are imperfectly mobile, a firm may find it difficult to transfer knowledge to its subsidiaries. In our analysis of 4964 Japanese subsidiaries over a 14-year period, we find that knowledge that is valuable, but not rare, positively affects subsidiary performance in the short term, but not the long term. In contrast, knowledge that is both valuable and rare affects subsidiary performance in the long term, but not the short term.

Drawing on the resource-based view and theory from the organizational learning and information-processing literatures, this study uses a sample of 201 firms to examine the influence of a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development on supply chain performance in varied market turbulence conditions. We found that synergies exist between a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development: their interaction has a positive association with performance. In addition, based on behavioral and contingency theories, we found that market turbulence moderates these relationships, having a positive influence on the knowledge development\u2013performance link and a negative influence on the culture of competitiveness\u2013performance link. Managers who are confident about the level of market turbulence they will face can use this sense to decide whether to emphasize developing either a culture of competitiveness or knowledge development in their supply chains. For those firms whose managers are unlikely to be able to predict the degree of turbulence they will face over time, a focus on both a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development is critical to ensuring success.

Our study examines the factors that affect intended and unintended termination and the longevity of IJVs. The findings show that approximately 90 percent of all IJV terminations are unintended and 10 percent intended, and that the frequency of intended termination and unintended termination varies noticeably depending on the initial purposes of formation. This suggests that the termination of IJVs is significantly contingent on their formation. The findings also show that the longevity of IJVs varies according to the initial purposes of formation, the initial conditions under which the IJV is formed, and the types of unanticipated contingencies that it encounters. The key theoretical issues and practical implications of the distinction between the intended and unintended termination of IJVs are also discussed.

In this paper, we consider resource divestment an important firm-level resource management capability that manifests a two-step organizational change routine. Firms must first be motivated to engage in resource divestment, and then decide which resources should be \u2018sold off.\u2019 In exploring this firm-level capability, we employ factor market theory to consider the \u2018seller side\u2019 of the market, and provide a useful framework for conceptualizing how firms generate competitive advantage through resource divestment.

In contrast, sharing personal advice improved work quality and signaled competence, but did not save time. Beyond the content of the knowledge, process costs in the form of document rework and lack of advisor effort negatively affected task outcomes.

Specifically, the study directly replicates the impact of social capital derived from the micro-managerial networking relationships and ties with top managers at other firms and government officials on macro-organizational performance using data from Ghana. This study further extends previous work by examining the impact of social capital derived from managerial social networking relationships and ties with community leaders on organizational performance. It examines how the relationship between social capital and organizational performance is contingent on an organization's competitive strategic orientation. The findings suggest that social capital developed from managerial networking and social relationships with top managers at other firms, government officials (political leaders and bureaucratic officials), and community leadership enhance organizational performance. The findings from the contingency analyses reveal some interesting trends. The impact of social capital on organizational performance differs between firms that pursue the different competitive strategies (low-cost, differentiation, and combination of low-cost and differentiation) and those who do not pursue those strategies.

When considering short-term performance outcomes, we predict a curvilinear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., firm productivity). Although we find evidence of a U-shaped relationship between racial diversity and productivity, the relationship is stronger in service-oriented relative to manufacturing-oriented industries and in more stable vs. volatile environments. For longer-term profitability, we propose and find support for more of a positive linear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., Tobin's q) than a nonlinear one. This linear effect is stronger and more positive in munificent compared to resource-scare environments. Thus, we aid in reconciling existing, often contradictory, studies by demonstrating the potential short-term vs. long-term impact of racial diversity on performance.

We elaborate the theory by predicting that alternative information sources moderate the influence of smaller adopters.

Extending prior research that has stressed the value-creation effect of network resources, it uncovers how prominent partners may undermine a firm's capacity to appropriate value from its alliance portfolio. Analysis of a comprehensive panel dataset of 367 software firms and their 20,779 alliances suggests that the contribution of network resources to value creation varies with the complementarity of those resources. Furthermore, the relative bargaining power of partners in the alliance portfolio constrains the firm's appropriation capacity, especially when many of these partners compete in the focal firm's industry. In turn, the firm's market performance improves with the intensity of competition among partners in its alliance portfolio. These findings advance network research by highlighting the trade-offs that alliance portfolios impose on firms that seek to manage and leverage their alliances.

An analysis of a sample of 458 acquisitions demonstrates that although higher premia are paid for R&D-related assets, the premia do not cause negative abnormal returns. Abnormal returns are more strongly affected by the overall target price levels independent of premia.

We locate our study in six Asian countries at different levels of institutional development. Results indicate that diversification negatively impacts performance in more developed institutional environments while improving performance only in the least developed environments. Even in the least developed institutional environments, diversification offers limited benefits when an economy-wide shock strikes. Though successful diversifiers are sometimes affiliated with business groups, diversification is associated with poorer performance for both affiliated firms and independent firms. In sum, we find that the outcomes of diversification are influenced by institutional environments, economic stability and affiliation with business groups.

The strategic group level has been largely excluded from this inquiry, despite evidence that group membership matters. In this study, we use hierarchical linear modeling to simultaneously estimate firm-, strategic group-, and industry-level influences on short-term and long-term measures of performance. We assess the three levels' explanatory power using a sample of 1,165 firms in 12 industries with data from a 7-year period. To enhance comparability to previous research, we also estimate the effects using the variance components and ANOVA methods relied on in past studies. To assess the robustness of strategic group effects, we examine both deductively and inductively defined groups. We found that all three levels are significantly associated with performance. The firm effect is the strongest, while the strategic group effect rivals and for some measures outweighs the industry effect. We also found that the levels have varying effects in relation to different performance measures, suggesting more complex relationships than depicted in previous studies.

Propositions are developed to explain when firms are most likely to enter into alliances for legitimacy purposes and how the legitimating role of strategic alliances contributes to firm and alliance performance.

We find evidence that the deregulation introduced to this historically staid industry has stimulated environmental differentiation. Differentiation is most likely to appear where its point of uniqueness is valued by customers, and we confirm this relationship in our sample. Specifically, utilities that served customers who exhibited higher levels of environmental sensitivity generated more \u2018green\u2019 power. The tendency for firms to differentiate in this way is lessened if they are relatively more dependent on coal-fired generation or relatively more efficient. Thus, there is evidence that firms sort themselves into either differentiation or low-cost strategies as the competitive realities of a deregulated world unfold. Deregulation and the ensuing environmental differentiation illustrate how utilities exploited formerly unmet customer demand for green power. The result has been greater levels of renewable generation and, hence, a cleaner environment.

Using resource-based arguments, we find that valuable and difficult-to-imitate strategies that recombine the firm's existing stock of resources to create new products, processes, or technologies have a positive effect on organizational recovery as measured by investors' expectations. Similarly, acquiring new resources through mergers or acquisitions also has positive effects on investors' expectations. In contrast, valuable and difficult-to-imitate strategies that provide the firm with access to new resources through alliances or joint ventures do not affect investors' expectations of performance. We also find that taking actions that are not valuable and difficult-to-imitate either have no effect on performance or may lead to further performance declines. Lastly, our results show that valuable and difficult-to-imitate strategic actions that use existing resources in new ways contribute the most to organizational recovery.

An investigation of concurrent sourcing","Transaction cost economics, neoclassical economics, and the firm capabilities literatures propose theories of the firm that typically depict firm boundaries determined by a dichotomous choice: the make or buy decision. However, none of these theories presents a satisfying explanation as to why firms would concurrently source, i.e., simultaneously make and buy the same good. This study combines these organizational economics theories and compares when firms make, buy, and concurrently source through surveying small manufacturing firms. Support was shown for aspects of all three theories, with evidence indicating that concurrent sourcing is a distinctly different choice, rather existing along a make/buy continuum.

The analysis examines the dimensionality of the contractual complexity construct and investigates the determinants of firms' adoption of various contractual provisions. We find two underlying dimensions of contractual complexity, based upon the enforcement and coordination functions of different contractual provisions. The evidence reveals that firms' usage of particular contractual provisions is a function of asset specificity as well as whether the alliance's duration is pre-specified or open-ended. The findings also speak to the debate surrounding the roles of prior ties and trust for alliance governance. Firms that have collaborated with each other in the past are not less likely to negotiate enforcement provisions; rather, repeat collaborators are less likely to adopt contractual provisions that are informational in nature and are geared to the coordination of the alliance.

However, a review of three top strategy journals revealed numerous areas in their use and interpretation where current practice fell short of ideal. Failure to understand how these models differ from ordinary least squares can lead researchers to misunderstand their statistical results and draw incorrect conclusions regarding the theory they are testing. Based on a review of the methodological literature and recent empirical papers in three leading strategy journals, this paper identifies four critical issues in their use: interpreting coefficients, modeling interactions between variables, comparing coefficients between groups (e.g., foreign and domestic firms), and measures of model fit. For each issue, the paper provides a background, a review of current practice, and recommendations for best practice.

Using the global airline industry as an empirical setting, I evaluate the proposition that membership in airline constellations allows carriers to capture externalities from other firms in the form of direct or indirect traffic flow, thereby enhancing their operational performance. I also distinguish between two ways to demarcate the boundaries of constellations: explicitly or implicitly. Analyzing patterns of membership in explicit constellations involving formal, multilateral agreements (such as the Star Alliance, Oneworld, SkyTeam), I find that membership benefits are greatest in groups involving large aggregate traffic and for carriers contributing with a large portion of the group's capacity. I also evaluate patterns of membership in implicit constellations, corresponding to groups of firms showing relatively more ties to one another than to firms outside their group. I find that carriers bilaterally linked with key players of such groups are able to increase their operational performance even if they do not belong to any explicit constellation. Thus, results show that it is worth analyzing distinct patterns of membership simultaneously, because they are likely to have distinct implications for firm performance.

We define code-preserving changes as a variation in the firm's product range that preserves the social code within which the firm positions its offering. By contrast, a code-violating change corresponds to a variation in the product range that breaks with past codes and embraces another social code. Our analyses of French haute cuisine restaurants show that code-preserving changes and code-violating changes have positive effects on external evaluations. Both effects decline with prior evaluations received by the organization, but only the effect of code-violating changes is reduced with age. Moreover, external evaluations improve when restaurants undertake more code-preserving changes than their direct competitors but decline when they make more code-violating changes than competitors. These results enable us to derive implications for research on strategic change, strategic groups, and strategic social positioning.

An important question arises, however, as to whether the TCE framework is equally appropriate for all types of firms in all business settings. In this paper, we argue that TCE is not and suggest that firms with high market power may be able to lower transaction costs under high asset specificity and uncertainty in nonintegrated distribution channels, avoiding the need to utilize highly integrated channels as a result. We test our hypotheses with data collected from 40 manufacturers of electronic and telecommunications products in 109 product-markets in the United States. The results support our hypothesis that transaction cost factors are better at explaining forward channel integration for firms with low market power than for firms with high market power. Our results indicate that the basic TCE framework must be supplemented by the market power construct to adequately explain forward channel integration decisions.

Specifically, the study demonstrates how the service quality of one partner can impact, or \u2018spill over\u2019 onto, consumers' evaluations of their transactions with a second partner, and how the performances of partners can have differing effects on customers' intentions to reuse a service partnership. The study tests hypotheses related to the quality, value, and reuse intentions of customers relative to the partnered service through a sample of 334 customers utilizing a seamless service alliance. Our results suggest that spillover effects of service partnerships can either result in beneficial gains for service partners or produce grave consequences when partner providers' service quality is substandard.

I answer these intrinsically cross-level research questions by examining how three design-intensive furnishings manufacturers managed their networks of joint-design alliances with consulting industrial design firms over more than 30 years. Initially, in order to explore the sample lead firms' alliance behavior, I advance an operationalization of interorganizational tie strength. Next, I unveil the strengths of strong ties and the weaknesses of a strong ties network. Finally, I show that the ability to integrate a large periphery of heterogeneous weak ties and a core of strong ties is a distinctive lead firm's relational capability, one that provides fertile ground for leading firms in knowledge-intensive alliance networks to gain competitive advantages whose sustainability is primarily based on the dynamic innovative capability resulting from leveraging a dual network architecture.

I argue that complex product systems, e.g., personal computers (PCs), are distinguished by functional interaction among several components, each guided by a relatively autonomous bundle of technical and economic characteristics. I try to explore whether the dynamics of such interactions between components of complex product systems can help us understand changes in the relative allocation of inventive effort. I advance and empirically test three hypotheses: (1) emergence of component constraints (bottlenecks) in product systems will trigger research and development (R&D) investment to resolve the constraints; (2) slack component firms have a strong incentive to invest in resolving component constraints; and (3) the incentive of slack component firms to invest in resolving component constraints is increasing in their prior sunk R&D investments in slack components. In sum, I argue that interactions between components in a product system conditions the R&D incentives of firms and also that the incentives are increasing in their prior investments or capabilities. Using product reviews from technical journals, I trace the constraint components in the PC from 1981 to 1998 and attempt to predict shifts in the allocation of inventive effort in the subsequent period. The empirical results strongly support all three hypotheses. This study highlights the paradoxical effect of modularity in complex product systems. Modular design architectures, while contributing to accelerating the pace of technical change, also tend to limit the economic benefits of firms' component R&D efforts, especially when different components technologies are progressing at different rates. This often creates an impetus to enlarge the scope of firm R&D activities beyond the component product markets that firms operate in. Other implications for R&D decision making are discussed.

An empirical test in technology outsourcing alliances","While the normative logic for forming technology outsourcing alliances is that such alliances allow outsourcing firms to specialize deeper in their domain of core competence without being distracted by noncore activities, recent empirical studies have reported the puzzling phenomenon of some firms continuing to invest in R&D in domains that are fully outsourced to specialized alliance partners. An underlying\u2014and widely made\u2014assertion that can potentially reconcile this contradiction is that \u2018peripheral\u2019 knowledge (specialized knowledge in the domain of outsourced activities) complements control in technology outsourcing alliances. However, this assertion is untested; and empirically testing it is the objective of this research study. Using data from 59 software services outsourcing alliances, we show that such peripheral knowledge and alliance control are imperfect complements: peripheral knowledge complements outcomes-based formal control but not process-based control. Thus, outsourcing firms might sometimes need knowledge outside their core domain because such knowledge facilitates effective alliance governance. Our theoretical elaboration and empirical testing of the assumed complementarities between peripheral knowledge and control in technology outsourcing alliances has significant implications for strategy theory and practice, which are also discussed.

Such a market structure phenomenon is quite commonplace in virtually every market, e.g., where there exists distinct market leaders and followers. DeSarbo, Grewal, and Wind recently (2006) proposed a new spatial methodology in SMJ to assess these competitive asymmetries based on information on consumer choice sets (i.e., a demand-based approach). However, the approach espoused by DeSarbo et al. results in as many competitive maps as there are brands/firms in a dataset. In this research, the authors devise a distance-based unfolding multidimensional scaling procedure for deriving joint spaces of brands/firms both as givers and takers of consumer consideration with the objective to have a more efficient representation of competitive asymmetries (i.e., one map irrespective of the number of brands/firms under study).

Hence, goal-oriented management of the alliance portfolio\u2014all the alliances of the focal firm\u2014plays a decisive role in company performance. Consequently, the configuration and development of the alliance portfolio become important strategic issues. In light of that, this article develops theoretical propositions that seek to clarify what determines the configuration and evolution of an alliance portfolio, and then presents the results of a longitudinal study to illustrate the developed theoretical framework. Building on contingency theory and a coevolutionary framework, we were able to identify three distinctive types of portfolio strategies at business level and to illustrate how they interact with the development of the business strategy and the business environment. Encompassing all this, the study illustrates and explains developmental paths and patterns in the evolution of an alliance portfolio. The developmental course typically evolves from adapting to shaping and to exploiting (stabilizing), according to the state of strategic uncertainty and the firm's resource endowment. A sudden increase in exogenous strategic uncertainty, however, can lead to a strategic shift back to an exploration or hybrid strategy.

Integration helps acquirers use the acquired firm's existing knowledge as an input to their own innovation processes (leveraging what they know), but hinders their reliance on the acquired firm as an independent source of ongoing innovation (leveraging what they do).

Based on a theoretical consideration of three fundamental national-level institutions\u2014national values, prevailing firm ownership structures, and board governance arrangements\u2014we argue that CEOs in different countries face systematically different degrees of constraint on their latitudes of action, and hence they differ in how much effect they have on firm performance.

However, prior FDI research has ignored the interrelated nature of these key FDI decisions. In addition, prior research does not fully account for the fact that individual ownership structure decisions occur within the context of a firm's broader FDI portfolio, and thus reflect a wide and frequently unobserved range of parent firm and host nation effects. Our research seeks to address both of these limitations. Using a rich dataset of 4,459 subsidiaries established by 858 Japanese firms across 38 countries over a 9-year period, we specify a conditional bivariate, cross-classified multilevel model of FDI ownership structure. Our model enables the joint estimation of entry mode and equity level, accounts for the portfolio nature of FDI, and compares the relative predictive power of transaction cost- and experience-based explanatory variables across both facets of ownership structure.

In this study, we examine three questions: (1) What drives the acquirer's choice between public and private targets? (2) Do acquisitions of private targets elicit a more positive stock market reaction than acquisitions of public targets, which, on average, destroy value for acquirers' shareholders? (3) Do acquirers gain when their selection of a public or private target fits the theory? In this paper, we argue that the lack of information on private targets limits the breadth of the acquirer's search and increases its risk of not evaluating properly the assets of private targets. At the same time, less information on private targets creates more value-creating opportunities for exploiting private information, whereas the market of corporate control for public targets already serves as an information-processing and asset valuation mechanism for all potential bidders. Using an event study and survey data, we find that: (1) acquirers favor private targets in familiar industries and turn to public targets to enter new business domains or industries with a high level of intangible assets; (2) acquirers of private targets perform better than acquirers of public targets on merger announcement, after controlling for endogeneity bias; (3) acquirers of private firms perform better than if they had acquired a public firm, and acquirers of public firms perform better than if they had acquired a private firm. These results support the expectation that acquirer returns from their target choice (private/public) are not universal but depend on the acquirer's type of search and on the merging firms' attributes.

Towards a dual-process model of capability dynamization","The recent discussion in the field of strategic management broadly favors the idea of dynamic capabilities in order to overcome potential rigidities of organizational capability building. The major question addressed in this paper is whether capabilities can actually be conceived as being in flux\u2014and if so, to what extent and in which way? After briefly recapitulating the distinguishing features of organizational capabilities, path dependency, structural inertia, and commitment are identified as the main capability-rigidity drivers causing a managerial dilemma. In the search for a resolution of this dilemma different approaches of dynamic capabilities are identified and discussed. The analysis shows that the approaches suffer from inherent conceptual contradictions: the dynamization runs the risk of dissolving the original idea and strength of organizational capability building. Ultimately, capabilities would lose the strategic power attributed to them in the resource-based view. The last section of this paper therefore aims to develop an alternative approach, which aims at preserving the original merits of organizational capability and solving the rigidity issue not by integrating a dynamic dimension into the capability construct but rather by establishing a separate function (\u2018capability monitoring\u2019). The suggestions mount up to a tier solution. Its logic builds on the dynamics of countervailing processes and second-level observation.

I develop a model of knowledge transfer in which firms replicate because knowledge is ambiguous and adapt because knowledge depends on context. In the model, firms replicate more when knowledge is discrete and adapt more when they understand the interactions between different areas of knowledge. Replication and adaptation lead to successful knowledge transfer, which leads to improved performance of the receiving unit. The predictions are tested using a survey of cross-border knowledge transfer relationships among firms in the telecommunications industry. The results are largely consistent with the model and point to potential areas for future research, such as the drivers of replication, the depreciation rate of knowledge, and the role of understanding in organizational knowledge.

We then supplement this implicit definition with an examination of the espoused definitions of the field obtained from a group of boundary-spanning scholars.

Building on Zhang's (2000) real\u2010options\u2010based equity value model, we develop a model to explain why firms with multiple business segments may have incentives in financial reporting to shift earnings from one segment to another to influence market valuation. Cross\u2010segment earnings shifting, however, causes information asymmetry about segmental performance, which leads to market misvaluation. Divestment arises as a voluntary commitment by (some) firms to not engage in segmental earnings manipulation, with the aim of restoring valuation accuracy. Our theoretical analysis yields a number of testable implications. Consistent with our model's predictions, we find empirically that (1) divestment is preceded by an increased divergence in profitability between the divested and continuing segments of the divesting firm, (2) there are positive abnormal stock returns surrounding divestment announcements that are not dependent on increased expectations about future operating performance, (3) the magnitude of market revaluation increases with the profitability divergence between the divested and continuing segments, and (4) market revaluation is greater for more complex firms (in terms of having a larger number of segments and greater uncertainty facing investors).","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/1/1/2911/Segment-Profitability-Misvaluation-and-Corporate","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on a theoretical model related to corporate divestment and financial reporting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we examine whether the new government\u2010wide statements provide information relevant for assessing a government's default risk, and if this information is incremental to that provided by the governmental funds statements. GASB No. 34 requires governments to publish governmental funds statements prepared on a modified accrual basis, and government\u2010wide statements prepared on an accrual basis. We find that GASB No. 34's Statement of Net Assets (similar to a corporation's balance sheet) provides information relevant for assessing default risk, and this information is incremental to that provided by the governmental funds statements. However, GASB No. 34's Statement of Activities (similar to a corporation's income statement) does not provide information relevant for assessing default risk. The accrual \u201cearnings\u201d measure is not more informative than the modified\u2010accrual \u201cearnings\u201d measure. A government's modified accrual earnings measure can be thought of as a type of measure of changes in working capital. Therefore, our results are consistent with research on corporate entities that attributes the superiority of earnings over cash flows primarily to working capital accruals and not long\u2010term accruals. For our sample of school districts, evidence suggests that total net assets from the government\u2010wide Statement of Net Assets, along with a measure of modified\u2010accrual \u201cearnings\u201d from the governmental funds statement, provide the best information for explaining default risk.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/1/205/2905/GASB-No-34-s-Governmental-Financial-Reporting","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of governmental financial reporting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

As the financial statements may be considered, in part, a product of negotiations between the auditor and client management (Antle and Nalebuff 1991), the negotiation strategy employed by the auditor may be useful in effectively fulfilling both tasks. To investigate the effect of auditor strategy on the resolution of proposed audit adjustments in a post Sarbanes\u2010Oxley environment, we conduct experiments that examine both the client and auditor sides of the negotiation. We investigate a strategy of \u201cconcession\u201d that draws upon the societal rule of reciprocation, which makes the waiving of inconsequential audit differences transparent. Specifically, with a concession approach, the auditor brings to the attention of the client all the audit differences (both significant and inconsequential) discovered during the audit and, subsequently, waives the inconsequential items. In contrast, a strategy of \u201cno\u2010concession\u201d of inconsequential items (in which the auditor discloses to the client only the significant audit differences that must be booked) renders the client unaware of the waived inconsequential differences. Results from the client experiments indicate that, relative to a no\u2010concession approach, participants representing client management (controllers/CFOs) are more willing to post significant income\u2010decreasing adjustments (both objective and subjective) when exposed to a concession approach in the course of negotiating the final contents of the audited financial statements. A concession approach also results in greater client satisfaction and retention. Consistent with these findings, results from the auditor experiment suggest that auditors also perceive that altering their approach toward greater disclosure of waived inconsequential audit differences can improve client satisfaction and retention.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/1/241/2917/The-Effect-of-Auditors-Use-of-a-Reciprocity-Based","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['reciprocity', 'negotiation', 'transparency']","The article discusses negotiation strategies and transparency in auditor-client relationships, which touches on ethical considerations but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or broader DEI themes.

It is shown that even though either ownership retention or reported earnings communicates the issuer's type to the market unambiguously, the issuer will strategically employ both signals to achieve separation from potential lower quality imitators at minimal cost. Comparative statics analysis shows that the trade\u2010off between the two signals depends critically on the uncertainty over future earnings. The theoretical analysis generates several empirical implications regarding market efficiency, IPO pricing, and the strategic choice of earnings management.

Our tests, based on both actual and simulated data, indicate that assessing the extent of reporting conservatism using this measure requires the recognition of, and control for, these characteristics. We also find that the difference in the timeliness of reporting bad versus good news is likely to be more pronounced than previously reported. Further, we provide additional evidence on the negative association between the DT measure and alternative aspects of conservatism, suggesting that the exclusive reliance on any single measure to assess the overall conservatism of a reporting regime (firms, countries, or time periods) is likely to lead to incorrect inferences.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/1/65/2899/Measuring-Reporting-Conservatism","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting measures and reporting conservatism without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We determine ex post intrinsic value of equity by discounting future dividends over a three\u2010year horizon and market price at the end of the horizon by industry cost of equity. The advantage of the ex post intrinsic value measure over stock returns is that it is not contaminated by the stock market's fixation on reported earnings (Sloan 1996). Also, unlike finite horizon future operating cash flows, ex post intrinsic values better reflect the magnitude, timing, and uncertainty of investors' future cash flows (SFAC No. 1, FASB 1978).

Several previous government attempts to introduce private sector management practices, such as management by objectives (MBO) or program planning and budgeting system (PPBS), have been largely unsuccessful. In contrast to prior reforms, the current restructuring introduced coordinated changes in the VHA organizational structure, performance measurement, and reward systems. Our results document that, following the reorganization, the VHA cost per patient declined significantly and various quality measures improved. Our analysis suggests that reduction in excess capacity and the more intense use of remaining capacity are among the primary explanations for the VHA achieving the observed cost reductions. These findings suggest that coordinated changes in organizational structure, performance measures, and incentives can create value for public enterprises even though control mechanisms are generally more limited in these environments than in the private sector.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/2/483/2921/Value-Creation-in-Public-Enterprises-An-Empirical","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['efficiency', 'quality', 'restructuring']","The article discusses organizational changes aimed at improving efficiency and quality in public enterprises, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

Though transfer prices above marginal cost introduce inter\u2010division coordination problems, they also introduce a lower willingness to pay to outside suppliers. Knowing that costly internal transfers will eat into demand, the supplier is more willing to set lower prices. Such supplier discounts can make decentralization worthwhile for the firm.

While managers use different names to describe these nonstandard earnings metrics, the financial press frequently refers to them as \u201cpro forma\u201d earnings. Managers and other advocates of pro forma reporting argue that these disclosures provide a clearer picture of companies' core earnings. On the other hand, regulators, policymakers, and the financial press often allege that managers' pro forma earnings disclosures are opportunistic attempts to mislead investors. Recent evidence suggests that while many pro forma earnings disclosures are altruistically motivated, some may represent managers' attempts to portray overly optimistic financial performance. If this is the case, then less wealthy, less sophisticated, individual investors are arguably the most at risk of being misled. Consequently, this study investigates who trades on pro forma earnings information. Our intraday investigation of transactions around earnings announcements containing pro forma earnings information reveals that less sophisticated investors' announcement\u2010period abnormal trading is significantly positively associated with the magnitude and direction of the earnings surprise based on pro forma earnings. In contrast, we find no association between sophisticated investors' trading and manager\u2010reported pro forma information. Overall, our analyses and numerous robustness tests suggest that the segment of the market that relies on pro forma earnings information is populated predominantly by less sophisticated individual investors. This evidence is particularly relevant to standard\u2010setters and regulators given that Section 401(b) of the Sarbanes\u2010Oxley Act of 2002 and subsequent SEC regulations are specifically designed to protect ordinary investors from misleading pro forma information.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/3/581/2941/Who-Trades-on-Pro-Forma-Earnings-Information","articles","TAR","Accounting","5","['misleading', 'investors', 'altruistically', 'pro forma', 'protection']","The article discusses the implications of pro forma earnings disclosures and their potential to mislead less sophisticated investors, highlighting a concern for ethical practices and investor protection.

In this study, we consider the effects of private signals that are informative of both systematic factors and idiosyncratic shocks affecting asset payoffs in a competitive, noisy, rational expectations setting. Taking a large economy limit, we show that (1) risk premiums equal products of betas and factor risk premiums, irrespective of information asymmetries; (2) holding total information constant, greater information asymmetry leads to higher factor risk premiums and, thus, higher costs of capital; and (3) controlling for betas, there is no cross\u2010sectional effect of information asymmetries on cost of capital.

The impact of this earnings heuristic on the actions of firms reporting accounting losses and the decision\u2010making effects the heuristic may have other than earnings management have not been examined. In this study we hypothesize that reporting an accounting loss acts as a heuristic trigger for firms to exercise the abandonment option and discard unproductive investments. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. We find that there is a sharp and economically significant discontinuity around zero in the level of investment in labor between small profit and small loss firms. The discontinuity is due to loss firms having a lower\u2010than\u2010expected level of investment in labor, given their economic fundamentals. Further tests show that this discontinuity is due to the exercise of the abandonment option. We find that firms switching from a profit to a loss cut labor to a greater extent than other firms with similar changes in earnings that do not pass the loss threshold. Taken together the results are consistent with the accounting loss heuristic acting as a major disciplinary or incentive altering event that resolves agency problems.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/4/1031/2926/Profits-versus-Losses-Does-Reporting-an-Accounting","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['loss', 'investment', 'labor']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of accounting loss and its impact on investment decisions, with no significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Alternatively, outsourcing routine internal audit tasks is more likely to lead to economic bonding, as well as potentially threatening internal auditor independence. Our results are consistent with firms with independent, active, and expert audit committees being less likely to outsource routine internal auditing activities to the external auditor. However, the outsourcing of nonroutine internal audit activities such as special projects and EDP consulting are not negatively related to effective audit committees. Additionally, outsourcing of either type of internal audit activity to an outside service provider other than the external auditor is not related to effective audit committees.

To hold the divisions accountable for their reports, the central office ties the project acceptance decision to a system of cost allocations comprised of depreciation and capital charges. If the proposed project concerns a common asset that benefits multiple divisions, then our analysis derives a sharing rule for dividing the asset among the users. Capital charges are based on a hurdle rate determined by the divisional reports. We find that this hurdle rate deviates from the firm's cost of capital in a manner that depends crucially on whether the coordination problem is one of implementing a common asset or choosing among multiple competing projects. We also find that more severe divisional agency problems will increase the hurdle rate for common assets, yet this is generally not true for competing projects.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/4/837/2940/Cost-Allocation-for-Capital-Budgeting-Decisions","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capital budgeting and cost allocation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Managers face agency costs of segment disclosure if the revelation of a segment that earns low abnormal profits reveals unresolved agency problems and, hence, leads to heightened external monitoring. By comparing a hand\u2010collected sample of restated SFAS No. 131 segments with historical SFAS No. 14 segments, we examine at the segment level whether managers' disclosure decisions are influenced by their proprietary and agency cost motives to conceal segment profits.

We examine 46 individual systems from eight different MCS categories\u2014financial planning, financial evaluation, human resource planning, human resource evaluation, strategic planning, product development, sales/marketing, and partnerships. We report analysis of the following: (1) The speed of adoption of financial planning and financial evaluation systems in relation to six other MCS categories. These systems are considered key MCSs associated with management accounting. We find financial planning to be the most widely adopted MCS category at an early stage, followed by the human resource planning and strategic planning categories. Financial evaluation systems are typically adopted at a later stage. (2) Variables associated with the rate of adoption of MCSs. Our results indicate that number of employees, presence of venture capital, international operations, and time to revenue are positively associated with the rate of adoption. Furthermore, the rate of adoption simultaneously affects company size. (3) CEO turnover and the rate of adoption of MCSs. We find that CEOs who have adopted fewer MCSs have shorter tenures. This is consistent with the hypothesized difference between entrepreneurs and managers. Overall, the evidence strongly supports the relevance of MCSs to the growth of early\u2010stage startup companies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/4/907/2960/Management-Control-Systems-in-Early-Stage-Startup","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['human resource planning', 'CEO turnover', 'financial evaluation']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of management control systems without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

These tasks may use similar information items and be performed within the same work session. While independent consideration of the information for each respective decision may be desired, psychology research on contrast effects suggests that the information from a previous decision may be retained and compared to the information provided for a current judgment. Such contrast effects are potentially critical to accounting judgments because they suggest that the information associated with a given decision task will be evaluated differently depending on the nature of the prior contextual information. Using a multi\u2010client audit context, we find that auditors are susceptible to contrast effects such that their judgments on a current client are influenced by their exposure to similar judgment information on a prior client. We also extend prior psychology and accounting research by examining and finding that for a current client, the magnitude of the contrast effect from an initial judgment task cascades to influence indirectly related subsequent judgment tasks for which no information from the prior client is available for comparison. We also find auditors' documentations of evidence are systematically affected by the contrast and cascading of contrast effects. Thus, our results provide support for contrast effects and, most important, the cascading of contrast effects to subsequent decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/5/1097/2950/The-Cascading-of-Contrast-Effects-on-Auditors","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on psychological effects in accounting judgments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The degree to which equity values impound the estimated fair values of R&D depends upon the extent to which the private information implicit in the R&D estimates is reflected in investor expectations. Financial statement recognition of R&D capital and analyst activities have been cited as alternative mechanisms by which private information about firms' R&D activities can be revealed to investors. I investigate the degree to which both mechanisms lead to the public revelation of the private information implicit in the R&D fair value estimates by examining whether financial statement recognition of R&D assets by the target prior to the merger announcement and/or analyst coverage of a target prior to the merger announcement influence the degree to which the target's pre\u2010merger announcement equity value reflects the acquirer's subsequently disclosed estimate of the fair value of the target's R&D capital. I find that the degree to which a target's pre\u2010merger announcement equity value reflects the estimated fair value of its R&D capital is increasing in the amount of R&D\u2010related intangibles captured in the target's pre\u2010merger announcement balance sheets and in the number of analysts covering the target prior to the merger announcement. This evidence is consistent with the notion that both financial statement recognition and analysts' private information search activities lead to the revelation of private information about the value of R&D assets that investors incorporate into equity values. I further find that the positive relation between analyst following and the market's valuation of R&D capital is strongest for the portion of the estimated fair value of R&D capital that is unrecognized by the target prior to the merger announcement. This finding is consistent with analysts filling in the information gap left by the lack of financial statement recognition. The results of this study confirm the theorized roles of financial statement recognition and analyst activities in aiding the market's valuation of intangible assets.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/5/1195/2969/The-Influences-of-Financial-Statement-Recognition","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial accounting practices and the valuation of R&D capital without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine who trades on security analyst stock recommendations by extending prior research to focus on investor\u2010specific responses to revisions. We find that both large and small traders react to analyst reports; however, large investors appear to trade more than small traders in response to the information conveyed by the analyst's recommendation and earnings forecast revision (proxied by the magnitudes of the recommendation change and the earnings forecast revision, respectively). We also find that small investors do not fully account for the effects of analysts' incentives on the credibility of analyst reports, as captured by the type of recommendation (i.e., upgrade versus downgrade or buy versus sell). In particular, small investors not only trade more than large investors following upgrade and buy recommendations, but also trade more following upgrade and buy recommendations than they do following downgrade and hold/sell recommendations. Furthermore, we observe that, on average, small traders are net purchasers following recommendation revisions regardless of the type of the recommendation; large traders tend to be net sellers following downgrades and sells. Consequently, large traders generate statistically positive returns from their trading, while small traders generate statistically negative returns from their trading. These findings are consistent with large investors being more sophisticated processors of information, and provide some support for regulators' concerns that analysts may more easily mislead small investors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/5/1227/2962/When-Security-Analysts-Talk-Who-Listens","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['investors', 'analysts', 'conflicts', 'misled']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of trading behavior and the influence of analysts on investor decisions, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Overall, we find that, on average, ICWs are not directly associated with higher cost of equity.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/5/1255/2930/Internal-Control-Weakness-and-Cost-of-Equity","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal control weakness and cost of equity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Both investment/growth and persistence information in accruals are likely to vary cross\u2010sectionally, depending on a firm's business model, a fact that generates different cross\u2010sectional implications for the accrual anomaly. I find that the magnitude of the accrual anomaly monotonically increases with the investment information contained in accruals, as measured by the co\u2010variation between accruals and employee growth. In industries/firms in which accruals co\u2010vary with employee growth, accruals show strong predictive power for future stock returns. In industries/firms in which accruals show little correlations with employee growth, the accrual anomaly is much weaker. In contrast, the evidence from the cross\u2010sectional analysis is inconsistent with the persistence argument. From the earnings perspective, the evidence on one\u2010year\u2010ahead earnings growth is inconclusive, but the results on longer\u2010term earnings growth support the investment argument but not the persistence argument. Collectively, I conclude that these results support the view that the accrual anomaly is attributable to the fundamental investment information contained in accruals.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/82/5/1333/2942/Accruals-Investment-and-the-Accrual-Anomaly","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to accruals and investment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.
