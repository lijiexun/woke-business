Our analysis illustrates two new support subfunctions (\u201cfreedom and opportunity for skill development\u201d and \u201cinspiration and motivation\u201d) and shows that first-ballot inductees had larger, more diverse developmental networks featuring greater multiplexity and more single-function ties, plus greater supplementary psychosocial and complementary career support from a wider range of core and peripheral career communities, than later-ballot inductees.

However, by deterring imitation, firms may induce rivals to create substitutes. This study shows that, contrary to received wisdom, firms are not uniformly inclined to deter resource imitation. Rather, this inclination decreases in response to substitution threat. By examining how firms manage the trade-off between inimitability and nonsubstitutability, this study suggests that the scenario wherein firms have omnipotent resources that are both inimitable and nonsubstitutable may be unrealistic and that managing the tension between these two attributes is key to sustainable competitive advantage.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.60263099","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on resource-based theory and competitive advantage without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We argue that both factors increase TMT ability to gather information on, and attend to, stakeholder needs, thereby yielding higher corporate social performance. We further predict that decentralization moderates the relationship between integrative complexity and corporate social performance in such a way that the relationship is stronger under conditions of centralization. Using a Q-sort methodology, which translates complex qualitative observations into quantitative metrics, we examined integrative complexity and decentralization in 61 Fortune 500 firms and found support for our predictions.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2008.0762","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['corporate social performance', 'stakeholder needs', 'decentralization']","The article discusses corporate social performance and stakeholder needs, which indicates a moderate focus on ethical considerations and social responsibility in management practices.

Although large, open egocentric networks foster network positions that provide access to nonredundant knowledge, critics have noted that such networks impair knowledge sharing, because trust and reciprocity do not thrive in them. This problem may, however, be resolved by including motivation and ability to share knowledge as moderators of the association between network position and knowledge sharing.

We find that bidder-to-target dissimilarity in product offerings and geographic reach exacerbates the negative effects of experience in small related acquisitions.

We suggest two key drivers of such desperation: (1) when a firm's organic growth is low, paying handsomely for acquisitions may be one of the few options for growth, and (2) when a firm becomes dependent on acquisitions for continuing growth, it is vulnerable to overpaying for acquisitions. Although pressures to grow via acquisition can be intense, we also test whether the benefits of acquisition experience\u2014from both acquirers and their advisors\u2014help to prevent overpayment caused by desperation. We test these ideas in a sample of firms in the banking industry between 1994 and 2005. Consistent with this theory of desperation, our results showed that firms desperate for growth are more likely to pay high acquisition premiums. Our findings on the moderating role of acquisition experience showed that advisors' acquisition experience is more helpful than acquirers' own acquisition experience in preventing desperate acquirers from overpaying for a target.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2011.56.1.026","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral learning theory and risk-taking in the context of corporate acquisitions, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In developing our theory, we clarify issues of levels of analysis as well as the relations between organizational fitness, endowment, organizational capital, and the hazard of failure.

Chief executive officers (CEOs) who have acquired positions of relatively high social status in the corporate elite tend to be attractive targets of flattery and opinion conformity from colleagues, which can have potentially negative consequences for CEOs and their firms. Our theory suggests how high levels of flattery and opinion conformity can increase CEOs\u2019 overconfidence in their strategic judgment and leadership capability, which results in biased strategic decision making. Specifically, we contend that heightened overconfidence from receiving high levels of such ingratiatory behavior reduces the likelihood that CEOs will initiate needed strategic change in response to poor firm performance.

When merging law firm partners share clients with one another, both within and across the boundaries of the formerly separate firms, they create new relationships that connect the organizational units together. We examine both the antecedents and consequences of post-acquisition integration through client sharing. Drawing on network theory, we consider how the configuration of prior referral relationships influences new sharing of clients undertaken by individual partners. We also use the prior referral-network structure to predict which partners will cut their former intraunit client-sharing ties. To ascertain how client sharing creates value for the combined organization, we analyze the effects of client sharing on revenue generation and human capital development. Our findings uncover a paradox in integration behavior: the same referral-network structures that contribute to integration by increasing interunit sharing also tend to detract from integration because they are associated with cutting existing intraunit ties. We also find that interunit client sharing is positively associated with revenue generation but negatively associated with human capital development. Overall, this research advances a relational perspective on post-acquisition integration and sheds new light on how networks are formed and become reconfigured inside organizations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839211432540","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['integration', 'relationships', 'human capital']","The article primarily focuses on organizational behavior and value creation in the context of acquisitions, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize that this strategy should be more effective than the widely used incentive-by-proxy strategy, in which one makes a request of a target, promising to provide aid to a valued third party if the target first complies with the request (e.g., offering to make a donation to charity for every employee who complies with a request). We found that hotel guests were more likely to reuse their towels when the hotel\u2019s environmental conservation program used a reciprocity-by-proxy strategy than when it used an incentive-by-proxy or standard environmental strategy.

Mediation analyses indicate that this difference is explained by women\u2019s concern that being highly voluble will result in negative consequences (i.e., backlash).

Power evolves when individuals\u2019 openness or closure to interpersonal influences correspond with their prior relative control over the group\u2019s issue outcomes. In groups with members who are appraising the relative power of their members over the outcomes of prior issues, a mechanism of \u201creflected appraisals\u201d will elevate and dampen members\u2019 self-appraisals of their relative power and the amount of influence they accord to others. Across a series of issues over time, this mechanism suffices to generate state transitions of a group\u2019s influence network. The result is an evolution of the group\u2019s influence network such that, with rare exceptions, power becomes concentrated and the preferences of a single leader control the group\u2019s outcomes via intermediaries. A laboratory experiment and a simulation provide support for the theory. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the influence network toward concentrated forms of power and control is generated by fundamental social psychological responses to power and may occur in all enduring social groups whose members are dealing with a lengthy sequence of issues, independent of the conditions of bureaucratic organizations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212441349","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['power', 'influence', 'control']","The article discusses the evolution of power dynamics within groups, focusing on interpersonal influences and control, which touches on social structures but lacks explicit references to DEI, ethics, or social justice themes.

Across four studies, the unstable powerful and the stable powerless preferred probabilistic over certain outcomes and engaged in more risky behaviors in an organizational decision-making scenario, a blackjack game, and a balloon-pumping task than did the the stable powerful and the unstable powerless. These effects appeared to be the result of the increased stress that accompanied states of unstable power and stable powerlessness: these states produced more physiological arousal, a direct manipulation of stress led to greater risk taking, and stress tolerance moderated the interaction between power and stability on risk taking. These results have important implications for the way social scientists conceptualize the psychology of power and offer a theoretical framework for understanding factors that lead to risk taking in organizations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212441928","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['power', 'stability', 'risk taking', 'social hierarchy', 'stress']","The article explores the dynamics of power and stability within social hierarchies, touching on themes of social status and decision-making under stress.

First, there is scant research on the potential of organizational culture, and specifically subcultures to influence the strategic alignment of IS and organizations. Second, there is a dearth of literature that considers the relationship between alignment and implementation success. In this paper, we address both of these gaps by considering the influence of organizational subcultures on the alignment of a specific IS\u2014a knowledge management system (KMS)\u2014with organizational strategy. Our analysis demonstrates the important roles played by three different subcultures\u2014enhancing, countercultural, and chameleon\u2014in the alignment of the KMS. The analysis also underscores the complementary nature of the alignment and implementation literatures and suggests that they should be used in concert to explain the success of an IS. Drawing on our analysis, we build a subculture model, which depicts the intersection of alignment and implementation. From a managerial perspective, the subculture model highlights three different approaches to managing alignment and implementation. From a theoretical perspective, our paper highlights the need for IS alignment models to be modified, so that subunit-level analyses are incorporated.

This study examines competition among firms in online sponsored search markets\u2014one of the fastest growing and most competitive of online markets. We develop and test a model that predicts the clickthrough rate (CTR) of a seller's listing in a sponsored search setting. Drawing on consumer search theory and competitive positioning strategies, we theorize that CTR is jointly driven by a seller's positioning strategy as reflected by the unique selling proposition (USP) in its \u201cad creative,\u201d by its rank in a sponsored search listing, and by the nature of competition around the focal firm's listing. We use data from a field experiment conducted by a leading firm in the mortgage industry where the firm varied its rank and USP dynamically. Results suggest that sponsored search listings can act as effective customer segmentation mechanisms, consistent with a model of consumer search in directional markets. We further find that the effect on CTR of a firm's positioning strategy and its rank in a listing is strongly moderated by its ability to differentiate itself from adjacent rivals. We discuss the implications of our findings for sellers' strategies in sponsored search markets and for extending the understanding of consumer search behavior in directional markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0254","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition and performance in online markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This study examines the impact of conversion technologies on market equilibrium in the context of sequential duopoly competition and proprietary technology standards. We analyze this question by departing from the extant literature to endogenize the decision to provide a converter and incorporate explicit negotiations between firms concerning the extent of conversion. We argue that these choices better reflect the environment facing firms in digital goods industries and find that these decisions change some of the established results in the literature. Specifically, we find that unless network effects are very large, the subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPNE) involves firms' agreeing to provide digital converters at a sufficiently low price to all consumers. At this equilibrium, both the entrant and the incumbent are better off because the provision of converters alleviates price competition in the market and leads to both higher product revenues and higher proceeds from the sale of converters. Moreover, under some circumstances, the provision of converters is welfare enhancing. These findings have important implications for research and practice in the adoption of new digital goods as the introduction of conversion technologies can reduce the social costs of standardization without compromising the benefits of network effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0255","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['welfare', 'social costs', 'compatibility']","The article discusses welfare enhancement and social costs, which touch on broader societal impacts, but the primary focus remains on technical and market dynamics rather than explicitly addressing social justice or DEI themes."],["2011","22","1","Hsing Kenneth ChengHsing Kenneth Chenghkcheng@ufl.eduDepartment of Information Systems and Operations Management, Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611Search for more papers by this author, Subhajyoti BandyopadhyaySubhajyoti Bandyopadhyayshubho@ufl.eduDepartment of Information Systems and Operations Management, Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611Search for more papers by this author, Hong GuoHong Guohguo@nd.eduDepartment of Management, Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556Search for more papers by this author","The Debate on Net Neutrality: A Policy Perspective","The status quo of prohibiting broadband service providers from charging websites for preferential access to their customers\u2014the bedrock principle of net neutrality (NN)\u2014is under fierce debate. We develop a game-theoretic model to address two critical issues of NN: (1) Who are gainers and losers of abandoning NN? (2) Will broadband service providers have greater incentive to expand their capacity without NN? We find that if the principle of NN is abolished, the broadband service provider stands to gain from the arrangement, as a result of extracting the preferential access fees from content providers. Content providers are thus left worse off, mirroring the stances of the two sides in the debate. Depending on parameter values in our framework, consumer surplus either does not change or is higher in the short run. When compared to the baseline case under NN, social welfare in the short run increases if one content provider pays for preferential treatment but remains unchanged if both content providers pay. Finally, we find that the incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under NN are higher than those under the no-net-neutrality (NNN) regime, except in some specific cases. Under NN, the broadband service provider always invests in broadband infrastructure at the socially optimal level but either under- or overinvests in infrastructure capacity in the absence of NN.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0257","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['net neutrality', 'social welfare', 'consumer surplus']","The article discusses net neutrality and its implications for social welfare and consumer surplus, indicating some awareness of social issues.

Previous empirical work has mainly offered consumer- and/or product-based explanations for this phenomenon. In contrast, our research explores the key role played by vendors' price-format adoption in explaining price dispersion. We empirically analyze over a half-million online and offline prices offered by major U.S. airlines in the top 500 domestic markets. Our study shows that a vendor's price format remains an important source of price dispersion in both channels even after accounting for other factors known to impact dispersion in airline ticket prices. Importantly, this finding is true for both transacted and posted tickets. We document several other interesting empirical findings. First, the lower variance in the prices of \u201ceveryday low price\u201d (EDLP) firms serves to reduce the market-level dispersion in prices when such firms are present. Moreover, the price variance of non-EDLP firms in these markets is also lower than in those markets in which EDLP competitors are absent. Second, we also find that dispersion in offered prices increases closer to the departure date, which is consistent with theoretical assertion that price dispersion increases with reservation prices. Finally, we continue to observe dispersion of online prices even after accounting for vendor strategy and other known sources of dispersion, suggesting that the prices are unlikely to converge even in the presence of sophisticated online search mechanisms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0264","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price dispersion in the airline market without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Yet, a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide is currently lacking. This study examines three levels of the digital divide. The digital access divide (the first-level digital divide) is the inequality of access to information technology (IT) in homes and schools. The digital capability divide (the second-level digital divide) is the inequality of the capability to exploit IT arising from the first-level digital divide and other contextual factors. The digital outcome divide (the third-level digital divide) is the inequality of outcomes (e.g., learning and productivity) of exploiting IT arising from the second-level digital divide and other contextual factors. Drawing on social cognitive theory and computer self-efficacy literature, we developed a model to show how the digital access divide affects the digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide among students. The digital access divide focuses on computer ownership and usage in homes and schools. The digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide focus on computer self-efficacy and learning outcomes, respectively. This model was tested using data collected from over 4,000 students in Singapore. The results generate insights into the relationships among the three levels of the digital divide and provide a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide. While school computing environments help to increase computer self-efficacy for all students, these factors do not eliminate knowledge the gap between students with and without home computers.

We consider a two-period model with a monopoly software provider who develops and releases a software product to the market. Unlike previous research, we consider demand variability and endogeneity to determine the functionality of the software in the first and second periods. Demand endogeneity is the impact of the word-of-mouth effect that positively relates the features in the initial release of the product to its demand in the second period. We also determine the design effort that should be spent in the first period to prepare for upgrading the product in the second period\u2014upgrade design effort\u2014to tap into the possible future demand. Results show that the upgrade design effort can be lower or higher when there is more market demand uncertainty.

The results in this paper provide insights into how demand-side factors (market demand variability or demand endogeneity) can influence supply-side decisions (initial features and upgrade design effort).

We present a finite mixture logit model to predict likelihood of EPS adoption in business-to-business (B2B) settings. Our model simultaneously classifies firms into homogeneous segments based on firm-specific characteristics and estimates the model's coefficients relating predictor variables to EPS adoption decisions for each respective segment. While such models are increasingly making their presence felt in the marketing literature, we demonstrate their applicability to traditional information systems (IS) problems such as technology adoption. Using the finite mixture approach, we predict the likelihood of EPS adoption using a unique data set from a Fortune 100 company. We compare the finite mixture model with a variety of traditional approaches. We find that the finite mixture model fits the data better, controlling for the number of parameters estimated; that our explicit model-based segmentation leads to a better delineation of segments; and that it significantly improves the predictive accuracy in holdout samples. Practically, the proposed methodology can help business managers develop actionable segment-specific strategies for increasing EPS adoption by their business partners.

The precision with which the prototype helps a client assess his requirements depends on (a) the type of prototype provided by the vendor and (b) the client's feedback effort. The vendor can provide either a neutral or nonneutral prototype: The nonneutral prototype influences the client towards one particular set of requirements that may not be the true requirement, and the neutral prototype allows the client to assess his true requirements. This leads to the vendor's moral hazard problem. The client chooses to exert either the high or low feedback effort after the vendor provides the prototype. Because the effort is unobservable to the vendor, it can lead to the client exerting the low feedback effort: the client's commitment problem. In this paper we develop and discuss the role of the contract payment to provide the vendor with incentives to supply the neutral prototype, as well as for the client to commit to the high feedback effort. In this setting, we also examine the \u201canchoring\u201d effect, wherein even a high-feedback effort can influence the client more toward a particular set of requirements with the nonneutral prototype.

In spite of many potential benefits of this model, ASPs experienced business failure and high rates of exit. Drawing on agency theory, we argue that the efficiency of contracting arrangements between ASPs and client organizations is an important determinant of ASP survival. We test this prediction using a unique data set combining multiple sources that allows us to track an ASP from the year of founding through the beginning of 2006. Contractual misalignment, or adopting contracts mismatched with the underlying agency costs, significantly lowers the probability of survival of service providers in the ASP marketplace. The impact of misalignment is particularly severe when coupled with adjustment costs that impede the transition to aligned contracts. To account for potential heterogeneity in ASPs' knowledge of contracting, we test for endogenous self-selection of ASPs in the relationship between contractual misalignment and survival. Our results are robust to a variety of model specifications as well as alternate explanations of survival from multiple theoretical domains.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0251","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contracting efficiency and firm survival without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Internet-based electronic markets have the potential to reduce transaction and search costs, thereby creating more efficient, \u201cfrictionless\u201d markets, as predicted by theories in information economics. However, earlier work has reported significant levels of price dispersion on the Internet, which is in contrast to theoretical predictions. A key feature of the existing stream of work has been its use of posted prices to estimate price dispersion. In theory, this can lead to an overestimation of price dispersion because a sale may not have occurred at the posted price. In this research, we use a unique data set of actual transaction prices collected from both the electronic and offline markets of buyers in a business-to-business market to evaluate the extent of price dispersion. We find that price dispersion in the electronic market is as low as 0.22%, which is substantially less than that reported in the existing literature. This near-zero price dispersion suggests that in some electronic markets the \u201claw of one price\u201d can prevail when we consider transaction prices, instead of posted prices. We further develop a theoretical framework that identifies several new drivers of price dispersion using transaction data. In particular, we focus on four product-level and market-level attributes\u2014product cost, order cycle time, own price elasticity, and transaction quantity, and we estimate their impact on price dispersion. We also examine the electronic market's moderating role in the relationship between these drivers and price dispersion. Finally, we estimate the efficiency gains that accrue from transactions in the relatively friction-free market and find that the electronic market can enhance consumer surplus by as much as $97.92 million per year.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0252","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on market efficiency and price dispersion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

On the other hand, new paradigms such as overlay networks are defining service-based logical architecture for the network services that make locating content and routing more efficient. Along with Internet2's proposed service-based routing, overlay networks will create a new set of challenges in the provision and management of content over the network. However, a lack of proper infrastructure investment incentive may lead to an environment where network growth may not keep pace with the service requirements. In this paper, we present an analysis of investment incentives for network infrastructure owners under two different pricing strategies: congestion-based negative externality pricing and the prevalent flat-rate pricing. We develop a theoretically motivated gradient-based heuristic to compute maximum capacity that a network provider will be willing to invest in under different pricing schemes. The heuristic appropriates different capacities to different network components based on demand for these components. We then use a simulation model to compare the impact of dynamic congestion-based pricing with flat-rate pricing on the choice of capacity level by the infrastructure provider. The simulation model implements the heuristic and ensures that near-optimal level of capacity is allocated to each network component by checking theoretical optimality conditions. We investigate the impact of a variety of factors, including the per unit cost of capacity of a network resource, average value of the users' requests, average level of users' tolerance for delay, and the level of exogenous demand for services on the network. Our results indicate that relationships between these factors are crucial in determining which of the two pricing schemes results in a higher level of socially optimal network capacity. The simulation results provide a possible explanation for the evolution of the Internet pricing from time-based to flat-rate pricing. The results also indicate that regardless of how these factors are related, the average stream of the net benefits realized under congestion-based pricing tends to be higher than the average net benefits realized under flat-rate pricing. These central results point to the fallacy of the arguments presented by the supporters of net neutrality that do not consider the incentives for private investment in network capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0253","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['socially optimal', 'incentives', 'network growth']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of network infrastructure investment and pricing strategies, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

To understand the critical resources that contribute to digital inequality and inform public policy for stimulating initial and continued ICT usage by the SED, we drew on capital theories and conducted a field study to investigate: (1) the forms of capital for using ICT and how they differ across potential adopters who are SED and socioeconomically advantaged (SEA); (2) how these forms of capitals are relatively impacted for the SEA and the SED through public policy for ICT access; and (3) how each form of capital influences the SED's intentions to use initially and to continue to use ICT. The context for our study involved a city in the southeastern United States that offered its citizens free ICT access for Internet connectivity. Our results show that SED potential adopters exhibited lower cultural capital but higher social capital relative to the SEA. Moreover, the SED who participated in the city's initiative realized greater positive gains in cultural capital, social capital, and habitus than the SEA. In addition, we find that the SED's initial intention to use ICT was influenced by intrinsic motivation for habitus, self-efficacy for cultural capital, and important referents' expectations and support from acquaintances for social capital. Cultural capital and social cultural capital also complemented each other in driving the SED's initial use intention. The SED's continued use intention was affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for habitus and both knowledge and self-efficacy for cultural capital but was not affected by social capital. We also make several recommendations for future research on digital inequality and ICT acceptance to extend and apply the proposed capital framework.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0256","","ISR","Information Systems","8","['digital inequality', 'socioeconomically disadvantaged', 'public policy', 'cultural capital', 'social capital']","The article focuses on digital inequality and its impact on socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, emphasizing public policy initiatives aimed at improving ICT access.

This traditional view of P2P networks is changing, however, and the use of P2P networks has been suggested for delivering general-purpose content over the Web (or corporate intranets), even in real time. We analyze sharing in a P2P community in this new context under three different congestion measures: delay, jitter, and packet loss. Sharing is important to study in the presence of congestion because most existing research on P2P networks views congestion in the network as a relatively insignificant criterion. However, when delivering general-purpose content, congestion and its relationship to sharing is a critical factor that influences end-user performance. This paper looks at P2P networks from this new perspective by explicitly considering the effects of congestion on user incentives for sharing. We also propose a simple incentive mechanism that induces socially optimal sharing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0258","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['sharing', 'socially optimal', 'incentive']","The article discusses sharing and proposes a mechanism for socially optimal sharing, indicating a slight focus on social implications.

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites.

Our results indicate a sharp contrast between the direct and interactive effects of IT on both the return (profitability) and risk (variability of returns) dimensions. Although the direct effect of IT capital is to increase firm risk for a given level of return, we find that suitable boundary strategies can moderate the impact of IT on firm performance in a way that increases return and decreases risk, at the margin. This interaction effect is strongest in service firms, in firms with high levels of IT investment intensity, and in more recent time periods. Our results are robust to alternative proxies for firm risk, including an ex ante risk measure (variability of analysts' earnings estimates), and alternative risk-return specifications. Put together, our results provide new insights into how IT and firm boundary strategies interact to affect the risk and return performance of firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0261","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of information technology investment and its impact on firm performance, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Drawing on punishment research and justice theory, a research model is developed. Data collected from a field survey of enterprise resource planning (ERP) users are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that IT compliance intention is strongly influenced by perceived justice of punishment, which is negatively influenced by actual punishment. When perceived justice of punishment is considered, the effect of satisfaction on compliance intention decreases and that of perceived usefulness becomes insignificant. This paper contributes to information systems (IS) research and practice by drawing attention to the importance of punishment, particularly perceived justice of punishment, in mandatory IT settings. It delineates the relationships among actual punishment, punishment expectancy, perceived justice of punishment, and IT compliance intention, and thus provides a better understanding of user compliance behavior in mandatory IT settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0266","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['justice', 'compliance', 'punishment']","The article discusses themes of 'justice' and 'punishment' in the context of IT compliance, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations within information systems.

They require appropriate software platforms that provide automated winner determination and decision support for bidders. Several promising ascending combinatorial auction formats have been developed throughout the past few years based on primal-dual algorithms and linear programming theory. The ascending proxy auction and iBundle result in Vickrey payoffs when the coalitional value function satisfies buyer submodularity conditions and bidders bid their best responses. These auction formats are based on nonlinear and personalized ask prices. In addition, there are a number of designs with linear prices that have performed well in experiments, the approximate linear prices auction, and the combinatorial clock auction. In this paper, we provide the results of lab experiments that tested these different auction formats in the same setting.

This view predicts that firms tend to decentralize IT governance in more uncertain environments. We investigate this issue by studying the relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance in a sample of business units from Fortune 1000 companies. The key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in IT infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship. That is, when environmental uncertainty increases from low to high, firms tend to first decentralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the business units to enhance their responsiveness; and then centralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the headquarters as uncertainty increases further, to achieve the benefits of coordination and to mitigate the potential agency problem in uncertain environments. Moreover, the study proposes that business unrelatedness between business units and their headquarters moderates the curvilinear relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance. We find that both the propositions are supported by the data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0269","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT governance and environmental uncertainty without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using data mining and clickstream analysis techniques, merchants can now adapt website content in real time to capture the current preferences of online customers. Though the ability to offer adaptive content in real time opens up new business opportunities for online merchants, it also raises questions of timing. One question is when to present personalized content to consumers. Consumers prefer early presentation that eases their selection process, whereas adaptive systems can make better personalized content if they are allowed to collect more consumers' clicks over time. A review of personalization research confirms that little work has been done on these timing issues in the context of personalized services. The current study aims to fill that gap. Drawing on consumer search theory, we develop hypotheses about consumer responses to differences in presentation timing and recommendation type and the interaction between the two. The findings establish that quality improves over the course of an online session but the probability of considering and accepting a given recommendation diminishes over the course of the session. These effects are also shown to interact with consumer expertise, providing insights on the interplay between the different design elements of a personalization strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0262","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['personalization', 'consumer behavior', 'data mining']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of web personalization and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

We propose that the outcome of the product evaluation task is determined by the fit between the type of information provided and the type of information sought by the consumer and that this, in turn, influences a consumer's attitude toward an e-store. An experiment to compare the impact of one type of advanced evaluation support technology, the virtual model, with a more basic online catalog, is then described. Results indicate that virtual models are potentially valuable when a customer is concerned with self-image and considerably less valuable when concerned with functionality. In more general terms, variation in end-user attitudes toward the object of the task (evaluative attitude) influenced how informed consumers felt about a product when using different technologies. Feeling informed, in turn, had a strong effect on consumer attitudes toward the store. Our results highlight two important issues for online stores: (1) a consumer's information requirements depend on his or her attitude to a product rather than product attributes; and (2) meeting or not meeting these information requirements affects perceptions of the store. Business success in this context therefore appears to hinge on addressing the specific functional and image-related information needs of customers rather than simply providing more interactivity or technical functionality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0279","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['self-image', 'consumer', 'attitude']","The article discusses consumer attitudes and self-image in the context of online shopping, which touches on personal and social aspects of consumer behavior.

While targeting CRM improves the success rate of distinguishing between nonloyal and loyal customers, support CRM increases the probability of retaining the loyalty of existing customers. We also consider the costs of implementing each CRM type separately as well as both types simultaneously. We show that the optimal CRM implementation strategy depends on the initial mass of loyal customers and diseconomies of scale in simultaneous implementation. We also find that the two types of CRM technologies are substitutive rather than complementary in generating revenue. We discuss why it is difficult to avoid overinvestments in CRM when the nature of the investments is misunderstood.

Most of this attention has focused on the impact of IS resistance on systems' initial implementation, but little research has investigated whether and how post-adoption resistance affects performance. We focus on a particular type of post-adoption resistance, which we call IS avoidance, to identify situations in which individuals avoid working with adopted IS despite the need and opportunity to do so. We examine the effects of IS avoidance on patient care delivered by health-care groups across three levels of analysis: the individual level, the shared group level, and the configural group level. We find that IS avoidance is significantly and negatively related to patient care only at the configural group level, which suggests that patient care is not degraded by the number of doctors and/or nurses in a group avoiding a system, but rather by their locations in the group's workflow network configuration. We use qualitative data collected over 16 months at the research site to help explain these results.

There is little else that is as consequential to an individual as his or her health. In this context, the privacy of one's personal health information has escalated as a matter of significant concern for the public. We pose the question: under what circumstances will individuals be willing to disclose identified personal health information and permit it to be digitized? Using privacy boundary theory and recent developments in the literature related to risk-as-feelings as the core conceptual foundation, we propose and test a model explicating the role played by type of information requested (general health, mental health, genetic), the purpose for which it is to be used (patient care, research, marketing), and the requesting stakeholder (doctors/hospitals, the government, pharmaceutical companies) in an individual's willingness to disclose personal health information. Furthermore, we explore the impact of emotion linked to one's health condition on willingness to disclose. Results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 adults underscore the complexity of the health information disclosure decision and show that emotion plays a significant role, highlighting the need for re-examining the timing of consent. Theoretically, the study extends the dominant cognitive-consequentialist approach to privacy by incorporating the role of emotion. It further refines the privacy calculus to incorporate the moderating influence of contextual factors salient in the healthcare setting. The practical implications of this study include an improved understanding of consumer concerns and potential impacts regarding the electronic storage of health information that can be used to craft policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0335","","ISR","Information Systems","6","['privacy', 'disclose', 'consumer concerns', 'emotional', 'health information']","The article addresses significant themes related to privacy and consumer concerns in the context of digitized healthcare, indicating an awareness of ethical implications and emotional factors in health information disclosure.

We develop an analytical model in which a variety of factors are balanced to best manage the detection component within information security management. The approach not only considers conventional factors such as detection rate and false-positive rate, but also factors associated with hacker behavior that occur in response to improvements in the detection system made by the firm. Detection can be improved by increasing the system's discrimination ability (i.e., the ability to distinguish between attacks and normal usage) through the application of maintenance effort. The discrimination ability deteriorates over time due to changes in the environment. Also, there is the possibility of sudden shocks that can sharply degrade the discrimination ability. The firm's cost increases as hackers become more knowledgeable by disseminating security knowledge within the hacker population. The problem is solved to reveal the presence of a steady-state solution in which the level of system discrimination ability and maintenance effort are held constant. We find an interesting result where, under certain conditions, hackers do not benefit from disseminating security knowledge among one another. In other situations, we find that hackers benefit because the firm must lower its detection rate in the presence of knowledge dissemination. Other insights into managing detection systems are provided. For example, the presence of security shocks can increase or decrease the optimal discrimination level as compared to the optimal level without shocks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0341","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information security management and does not address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

In this context, we find that an independent PHR platform can create incentives for the providers to share their patients' records electronically with other providers by selectively subsidizing them.

Although there are studies based on anecdotal evidence and self-reported data on how automation impacts medical errors, no systematic studies exist that are based on actual error rates from hospitals. Further, there is no systematic evidence on how incremental automation over time and across multiple wards impacts the rate of medical errors. The primary objective of our study is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining how the automation of core error prevention functions affects two types of medical errors. We draw on the medical informatics literature and principal-agency theory and use a unique panel data set of actual documented medical errors from two major hospitals to analyze the interplay between automation and medical errors. We hypothesize that the automation of the sensing function (recording and observing agent actions) will have the greatest impact on reducing error rates. We show that there are significant complementarities between quality management training imparted to hospital staff and the automation of control systems in reducing interpretative medical errors. We also offer insights to practitioners and theoreticians alike on how the automation of error prevention functions can be combined with training in quality management to yield better outcomes.

This study examines learning curves in an IT-PRS setting to determine whether agents achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates and how information technologies transform the learning dynamics in this setting. We present a hierarchical Bayes model that accounts for different agent skills (domain and system) and estimate learning rates for three types of referral requests: emergency (EM), nonemergency (NE), and nonemergency out of network (NO). Furthermore, the model accounts for learning spillovers among the three referral request types and the impact of system upgrade on learning rates. We estimate this model using data from more than 80,000 referral requests to a large IT-PRS. We find that: (1) The IT-PRS exhibits a learning rate of 4.5% for EM referrals, 7.2% for NE referrals, and 12.3% for NO referrals. This is slower than the learning rate of manufacturing (on average 20%) and more comparable to other service settings (on average, 8%). (2) Domain and system experts are found to exhibit significantly different learning behaviors. (3) Significant and varying learning spillovers among the three referral request types are also observed. (4) The performance of domain experts is affected more adversely in comparison to system experts immediately after system upgrade. (5) Finally, the learning rate change subsequent to system upgrade is also higher for system experts in comparison to domain experts. Overall, system upgrades are found to have a long-term positive impact on the performance of all agents.

Various information systems (IS) projects have been undertaken to enhance public health capacity for detecting EID in a timely manner and disseminating important public health information to concerned parties. While those initiatives seemed to offer promising solutions, public health researchers and practitioners raised concerns about their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news coverage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles\u2014coupling and decoupling circles\u2014between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS. We leverage the guidelines to evaluate current public health initiatives. By doing so, we identify limitations of existing public health IS, highlight the direction future development should consider, and discuss implications for research and public health policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1110.0376","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['public health', 'framework', 'effectiveness', 'capacity', 'management']","The article discusses public health initiatives and their effectiveness in managing emerging infectious diseases, which aligns with themes of social responsibility and ethical considerations in health management.

Elaborate training in new e-healthcare systems is not a luxury that is typically available to healthcare professionals\u2014i.e., doctors, paraprofessionals (e.g., nurses) and administrative personnel\u2014because of the 24 \u00d7 7 nature and criticality of operations of healthcare organizations, especially hospitals, thus making peer interactions and support a key driver of or barrier to such e-healthcare system use. Against this backdrop, using social networks as a theoretical lens, this paper presents a nomological network related to e-healthcare system use. A longitudinal study of an e-healthcare system implementation, with data gathered from doctors, paraprofessionals, administrative personnel, patients, and usage logs lent support to the hypotheses that: (1) ingroup and outgroup ties to doctors negatively affect use in all user groups; (2) ingroup and outgroup ties to paraprofessionals and administrative personnel positively affect use in both those groups, but have no effect on doctors' use; and (3) use contributes positively to patient satisfaction mediated by healthcare quality variables\u2014i.e., technical quality, communication, interpersonal interactions, and time spent.

We test these ideas in a sample of 141 acquisitions conducted by 86 Fortune 1000 firms. In the short run, acquirers that have high levels of CBITI capabilities receive positive and significant cumulative abnormal returns to their M&A announcements. Announcement period returns indicate that the capital markets value CBITI similarly in same-industry and different-industry acquisitions. In the long run, acquirers with high levels of CBITI capabilities obtain significantly higher abnormal operating performance. They create significantly greater value in complementary acquisitions from different industries than in related acquisitions from the same industry.

Their success, however, depends on participants' willingness to invest their time and attention in the absence of formal role and control structures. Why, then, would individuals choose to return repeatedly to a particular community and engage in the various behaviors that are necessary to keep conversation within the community going? Some studies of online communities argue that individuals are driven by self-interest, while others emphasize more altruistic motivations. To get beyond these inconsistent explanations, we offer a model that brings dissimilar rationales into a single conceptual framework and shows the validity of each rationale in explaining different online behaviors. Drawing on typologies of organizational commitment, we argue that members may have psychological bonds to a particular online community based on (a) need, (b) affect, and/or (c) obligation. We develop hypotheses that explain how each form of commitment to a community affects the likelihood that a member will engage in particular behaviors (reading threads, posting replies, moderating the discussion). Our results indicate that each form of community commitment has a unique impact on each behavior, with need-based commitment predicting thread reading, affect-based commitment predicting reply posting and moderating behaviors, and obligation-based commitment predicting only moderating behavior. Researchers seeking to understand how discussion-based communities function will benefit from this more precise theorizing of how each form of member commitment relates to different kinds of online behaviors. Community managers who seek to encourage particular behaviors may use our results to target the underlying form of commitment most likely to encourage the activities they wish to promote.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1090.0265","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['community', 'commitment', 'altruistic', 'engagement']","The article discusses community commitment and motivations for participation, touching on altruistic motivations which align with social engagement themes.

This model characterizes a number of information technology-based products and services for which variable increases in demand are fulfilled by the addition of blocks of computing or network infrastructure. Such goods are often modeled as information goods with zero variable costs; in fact, the actual cost structure resembles a mixture of zero marginal costs and positive periodic fixed costs. This paper discusses the properties of a general solution for the optimal nonlinear pricing of such digital goods. We show that the discontinuous cost structure can be accrued as a virtual constant variable cost. This paper applies the general solution to solve two related extensions by first investigating the optimal technology capacity planning when the cost function is both discontinuous and declining over time, and then characterizing the optimal costing for the discontinuous supply when it is shared by several business profit centers. Our findings suggest that the widely adopted full cost recovery policies are typically suboptimal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0283","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing digital goods and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience are uncovering the neural bases of cognitive, emotional, and social processes, and they offer new insights into the complex interplay between IT and information processing, decision making, and behavior among people, organizations, and markets. The paper reviews the emerging cognitive neuroscience literature to propose a set of seven opportunities that IS researchers can use to inform IS phenomena, namely (1) localizing the neural correlates of IS constructs, (2) capturing hidden mental processes, (3) complementing existing sources of IS data with brain data, (4) identifying antecedents of IS constructs, (5) testing consequences of IS constructs, (6) inferring the temporal ordering among IS constructs, and (7) challenging assumptions and enhancing IS theories. The paper proposes a framework for exploring the potential of cognitive neuroscience for IS research and offers examples of potentially fertile intersections of cognitive neuroscience and IS research in the domains of design science and human-computer interaction. This is followed by an example NeuroIS study in the context of e-commerce adoption using fMRI, which spawns interesting new insights. The challenges of using functional neuroimaging tools are also discussed. The paper concludes that there is considerable potential for using cognitive neuroscience theories and functional brain imaging tools in IS research to enhance IS theories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0284","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['cognitive neuroscience', 'social processes', 'decision making']","The article discusses cognitive neuroscience's insights into social processes and decision making, which suggests an awareness of human behavior in organizational contexts.

This study reports the results of a multi-industry survey investigating how psychological climate and KMS access influence solution reuse (exploitation) and solution innovation (exploration) in the context of technical support work.

There can be considerable heterogeneity in the quality of results returned by different IR servers. Further, because different servers handle collections of different sizes and have different processing and bandwidth capacities, there can be considerable heterogeneity in their response times. The broker in the DIR system has to decide which servers to query, how long to wait for responses, and which retrieved results to display based on the benefits and costs imposed on users. The benefit of querying more servers and waiting longer is the ability to retrieve more documents. The costs may be in the form of access fees charged by IR servers or user's cost associated with waiting for the servers to respond.

These providers, however, follow a fixed, posted pricing strategy that charges the same price in each time period and thus bear all the risk arising out of demand uncertainties faced by their client companies. We examine the effects of providing a spot market with dynamic prices and forward contracts to hedge against future revenue uncertainty. We derive revenue-maximizing spot and forward prices for a single seller facing a known set of buyers. We perform a simulation study using publicly available traffic data regarding Amazon S3 clients from Alexa.com to validate our analytical results. Our field study supports our analysis and indicates that spot markets alone can enhance revenues to Amazon, but this comes at the cost of increased risks due to the increased market share in the spot markets. Furthermore, adding a forward contract feature to the spot markets can reduce risks while still providing the benefits of enhanced revenues. Although the buyers incur an increase in costs in the spot market, adding a forward contract does not cause any additional cost increase while transferring the risk to the buyers. Thus, storage grid providers can greatly benefit by applying a forward contract alongside the spot market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0288","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and risk management in online storage services without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

On the other hand, such techniques are also being increasingly used for identity matching that leads to the disclosure of private information. These techniques can be used to effectively reidentify records even in deidentified data. Consequently, the use of such techniques can lead to individual privacy being severely eroded. Our study addresses this important issue and provides a solution to resolve the conflict between privacy protection and data utility. We propose a data-masking method for protecting private information against record linkage disclosure that preserves the statistical properties of the data for legitimate analysis. Our method recursively partitions a data set into smaller subsets such that data records within each subset are more homogeneous after each partition. The partition is made orthogonal to the maximum variance dimension represented by the first principal component in each partitioned set. The attribute values of a record in a subset are then masked using a double-bounded swapping method. The proposed method, which we call multivariate swapping trees, is nonparametric in nature and does not require any assumptions about statistical distributions of the original data. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both preventing identity disclosure and preserving data quality.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0289","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'identity', 'disclosure', 'data utility']","The article addresses the important issue of privacy protection in the context of data use, highlighting ethical concerns related to identity disclosure.

Our results demonstrate that IT outsourcing has made a positive and economically meaningful contribution to industry output and labor productivity. It has not only helped industries produce more output, but it has also made their labor more productive. Moreover, our analysis of split data samples reveals systematic differences between high and low IT intensity industries in terms of the degree and impact of IT outsourcing. Our results indicate that high IT intensity industries use more IT outsourcing as a percentage of their output, but less as a percentage of their own IT capital, and they achieve higher returns from IT outsourcing. This finding suggests that to gain greater value from IT outsourcing, firms need to develop IT capabilities by intensively investing in IT themselves. By comparing the results from subperiods and analyzing a separate data set for the earlier period of 1987\u20131999, we conclude that the value of IT outsourcing has been stable from 1998 to 2006 and consistent over the past two decades. The high returns we find for IT outsourcing also suggest that firms may be underinvesting in IT outsourcing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0290","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the economic impacts of IT outsourcing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This study posits the existence of additional beliefs that inhibit usage intentions and thus foster technology rejection rather than acceptance. We theorize that these inhibitors are more than just the antipoles of enablers (e.g., the opposite of usefulness or reliability) and so are distinct constructs worthy of their own investigation. Inhibitors are proposed to have effects on usage intentions beyond that of enablers as well as effects on enablers themselves. We report on a series of empirical studies designed to test the existence and effects of inhibitors. A candidate set of six inhibitors is shown to be distinct from enablers. These inhibitors are subsequently tested in a field study of 387 individuals nested within 32 different websites. Effects at both individual and website unit levels of analysis are tested using multilevel modeling. We find that inhibitors have negative effects on usage intentions, as well as on enablers, and these effects vary contingent upon individual or website unit levels of analysis. The overall results support the existence and importance of inhibitors in explaining individual intent to use\u2014or not use\u2014technology.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0295","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['technology acceptance', 'inhibitors', 'usage intentions']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of technology usage and acceptance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed that allows us to investigate (1) the extent to which individuals learn from their own experience and from interactions with peers, (2) whether an individual's ability to learn from these activities varies as she evolves/learns over time, and (3) to what extent individual learning persists over time. We calibrate the model based on six years of detailed data collected from 251 developers working on 25 OSS projects hosted at Sourceforge. Using the HMM, three latent learning states (high, medium, and low) are identified, and the marginal impact of learning activities on moving the developer between these states is estimated. Our findings reveal different patterns of learning in different learning states. Learning from peers appears to be the most important source of learning for developers across the three states. Developers in the medium learning state benefit the most through discussions that they initiate. On the other hand, developers in the low and the high states benefit the most by participating in discussions started by others. While in the low state, developers depend entirely upon their peers to learn, whereas in the medium or high state, they can also draw upon their own experiences. Explanations for these varying impacts of learning activities on the transitions of developers between the three learning states are provided. The HMM is shown to outperform the classical learning curve model. The HMM modeling of this study contributes to the development of a theoretically grounded understanding of learning behavior of individuals. Such a theory and associated findings have important managerial and operational implications for devising interventions to promote learning in a variety of settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0308","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['learning', 'peers', 'open source']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of developer learning dynamics in open source projects, with minimal reference to social themes such as diversity or ethics.

The current study extends the effort-accuracy perspective by considering trade-off difficulty, a type of negative emotion that arises when attainment of one's goals is blocked by the attainment of other goals; consequently, one must make trade-offs among the conflicting goals. Many product purchase choices for which RAs are used require users to make trade-offs among conflicting product attributes. A key feature of RAs, the preference elicitation method (PEM), often compels users to make explicit trade-offs. We examine whether an RA's PEM generates trade-off difficulty, which, in turn, affects users' evaluations (i.e., perceived amount of effort and perceived accuracy of recommendations) and the resultant acceptance of the RA. Trade-off difficulty influences users' evaluations of an RA via perceived control over execution of the RA PEM. In addition, the decision context in which users employ a PEM moderates the degree to which that PEM generates trade-off difficulty. Specifically, a PEM generates a greater degree of trade-off difficulty in a choice context that leads to a loss than in a choice context that leads to a gain. Consequently, users exert more effort to cope with trade-off difficulty in a loss condition. Because users voluntarily spend more effort, the negative influence of perceived effort on users' acceptance of an RA\u2014which is supported in prior studies\u2014decreases in a loss condition. A laboratory experiment was conducted using two between-subject factors: two RAs, one that employed a trade-off-compelling PEM and the other a trade-off-hiding PEM, and two decision contexts, one of which was a loss condition and the other a gain condition. The results supported all of the hypotheses.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0334","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of user acceptance of recommendation agents without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Firms experience a lower cost of capital if investors perceive that other investors are ignoring relevant disclosures (perceived errors of omission), but a higher cost of capital if investors perceive that others are responding to irrelevant disclosures (perceived errors of commission). The impact of these two sources of disagreement on the cost of capital is determined by the distribution of opinion and the nature of disclosure. For example, even though aggregated disclosures reveal less to investors, aggregated disclosures may decrease the cost of capital by eliminating disagreement associated with perceived errors of commission.

Recent research finds that investor judgments are significantly influenced by disclosure tone (positive versus negative). Holding tone constant, we investigate investors\u2019 reactions to vivid versus pallid information. Drawing on theories from psychology, we predict that investors will be sensitive to the differences between vivid and pallid language when the underlying information is preference inconsistent, but not when the information is preference consistent. Results of two experiments support our prediction. Vivid language significantly influences the judgment of investors who hold contrarian positions (i.e., short investors in a bull market and long investors in a bear market). Interestingly, vivid language has limited influence on the judgment of investors who hold positions consistent with the general tenor of the market. Our results provide evidence regarding when vividness matters and when it does not in financial contexts, thereby contributing to both psychology and a growing literature on disclosure tone in financial reporting.

A Natural Experiment with Small U.S. Public Companies","We use incremental and joint implementation of multiple SOX-based control effectiveness disclosure and audit mandates to assess relative performance of alternatives for small U.S. public companies. Using data from several low- and high-effort management disclosure and audit regimes implemented from 2003 to 2008, we find substantial and statistically significant increases in material weakness disclosure rates for small firms undergoing initial SOX 404(b) internal control audits, but find quantitatively and statistically similar increases for initial management reports of small firms exempt from such audits. As to audit cost, fees more than double for initial 404(b) audits in 2004 and remain high, while 404(b)-exempt firms\u2019 fees grow about 10% annually. Our results support the view that, for small firms, management internal control reports and traditional financial audits may be a cost effective disclosure alternative to full application of SOX 404(b). Also, our results suggest that, even without management reports on internal control, analysis of the cause of known accounting mistakes may yield substantial material weakness disclosures.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00400.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and audit practices without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Under EV accounting, the present value of future cash flows from in-force contracts is included in shareholders\u2019 equity, and profit is calculated as the change in equity between two periods. In contrast to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), this approach produces higher shareholder's equity and recognizes income at contract inception. I find firms that adopt EV reporting exhibit a decline in information asymmetry, with the decline increasing as EV reporting evolves to address methodological deficiencies and to permit more comparability across firms. The decrease in information asymmetry is contingent on providing an audit certification, and larger for firms that commit to providing EV reports. Moreover, I document that EV reporting is more widespread in countries with more hostile takeovers, managers that do not avoid volatile income measures, regulators that are less likely to intervene in the product market, and analysts that believe EV disclosure increases the value of their information intermediation function.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00401.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['transparency', 'unregulated', 'information asymmetry']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of financial reporting and transparency without addressing social justice or ethical critiques of business practices.

These effects persist even after the controls are changed, so that the effects of current controls can be strongly influenced by past control strength.

Further analyses suggest that managers\u2019 unintentional information processing bias contributes to this positive serial correlation.

In a cross-sectional analysis of the determinants of the timeliness of write-downs, I document that corporate governance quality, regulatory investigations, and litigation pressure are positively related to the timeliness of write-downs, whereas the write-downs by firms with higher financial leverage, tighter regulatory constraints, and more complex exposures are less timely.

After controlling for firm characteristics, bond features, home-country attributes, and market conditions, I find that foreign firms rely less on the U.S. public bond market after SOX. Additionally, some determinants of choosing the U.S. public bond market have changed since the passage of SOX: firms listing equities on U.S. stock exchanges, adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and doing large bond issuances are more likely to choose this market in the post-SOX period than in the pre-SOX period. Overall, these results are consistent with a shift in the expected costs and benefits of choosing the U.S. public bond market following SOX. This paper provides the first evidence about how SOX influences debt financing decisions and alters capital flows across international bond markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00416.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on bond market choices without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find compensation to be positively related to \u201cAll-Star\u201d recognition, investment-banking contributions, the size of analysts\u2019 portfolios, and whether an analyst is identified as a top stock picker by the Wall Street Journal. We find no evidence that compensation is related to earnings forecast accuracy. But consistent with prior studies, we find analyst turnover to be related to forecast accuracy, suggesting that analyst forecasting incentives are primarily termination based. Additional analyses indicate that \u201cAll-Star\u201d recognition proxies for buy-side client votes on analyst research quality used to allocate commissions across banks and analysts. Taken as a whole, our evidence is consistent with analyst compensation being designed to reward actions that increase brokerage and investment-banking revenues. To assess the generality of our findings, we test the same relations using compensation data from a second high-status bank and obtain similar results.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00417.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of analyst compensation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition, I find that these firms use option grants with longer vesting periods and that unvested equity holdings reduce the likelihood that their executives leave to find employment elsewhere.

We show that managers respond to the shareholder pressure by reporting positive corporate news before the annual shareholder meetings. Specifically, we find significantly positive average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) during the 40 days before the annual meeting date. The premeeting returns are significantly higher when shareholder discontent with managerial performance is likely to be stronger. The decile of companies with the worst past stock price performance exhibits average CARs of 3.4% and buy-and-hold returns of 7.0% during the 40-day premeeting period. Companies with poor past performance exhibit even higher premeeting returns when shareholder pressure on management is greater, such as when institutional ownership is high, when CEO compensation is high, and when shareholders submit proxy proposals on corporate governance. We complement the evidence based on CARs by showing how managers of poorly performing firms manage the timing and content of earnings announcements and management forecast announcements before the annual shareholder meetings. Overall, the results suggest that managers attempt to influence shareholders before annual shareholder meetings through positive news.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00419.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial behavior in response to shareholder pressure without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although firm and industry characteristics are important determinants of guidance, we conclude that CEOs participate in firm-level policy decisions, whereas CFOs are involved in the formation or discussion of guidance. Among firms that historically issued frequent guidance, breaks in guidance following CEO turnovers are relatively permanent and are potentially attributable to firm-initiated changes in guidance policy. Breaks following CFO turnovers, however, likely reflect uncertainty on the part of the newly appointed executive\u2014they are concentrated in the two quarters following the turnover, are associated with the background of the newly appointed CFO, and extend to the relative precision of the guidance. Among firms that did not issue guidance historically, we find some evidence that newly appointed externally hired CEOs increase the likelihood of providing guidance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00420.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of earnings guidance and executive turnover without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We propose that financial incentives can motivate decision-makers to correct mood congruency biases, in which judgments and decisions are consistent with moods. In experiment 1, participants rated the performance of one division manager based on two accounting measures and another manager based on a 16-measure BSC; there were mood congruency biases at both levels of information load. Financial incentives to make benchmark-consistent judgments eliminated bias in the former condition but not in the BSC condition. In experiment 2, incentives were offered and performance evaluations were based on an eight-measure BSC; mood congruency bias was eliminated. Results suggest that management control systems, specifically financial incentives, should be included in future affect correction research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00421.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial incentives and performance evaluations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The change in analyst following increases with the distance between prior local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and IFRS and with the extent to which IFRS adoption eliminates GAAP differences between the firm's country and the analyst's country.

For the audit review process to succeed as a quality control mechanism, any issues or questions identified by a reviewer must be adequately resolved and documented in the workpapers. If audit review fails to correct for errors/biases in the work of reviewees, there can be serious detrimental effects on audit quality and, in turn, financial statement quality. Our study extends the literature by examining the phase of the review process in which reviewees respond to (or \u201cclose\u201d) notes/comments provided by their reviewers. Utilizing an experiment, we find that certain contextual factors (review timeliness and review note frame) influence reviewee follow-through during this critical phase. Specifically, we find that a delayed review elicits significantly lower effort levels than a timely review. Review note frame (i.e., how the reviewer phrases the rationale given for the underlying directive of a review note) significantly affects reviewee effort and performance when the review is timely. Through mediation analyses, we explore the mediating effect of effort on performance. In addition, we find that reviewer delay leads to greater over-documentation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2011.00423.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['biases', 'audit quality', 'review process']","The article discusses biases in the audit review process, which indicates a concern for ethical practices in accounting.

We develop a six-item scale measuring individual differences in propensity to plan that can be adapted to different domains and used to compare planning across domains and time horizons. Adaptations tailored to planning time and money in the short run and long run each show strong evidence of reliability and validity. We find that propensity to plan is moderately domain-specific. Scale measures and actual planning measures show that for time, people plan much more for the short run than the long run; for money, short- and long-run planning differ less. Time and money adaptations of our scale exhibit sharp differences in nomological correlates; short-run and long-run adaptations differ less. Domain-specific adaptations predict frequency of actual planning in their respective domains. A \u201cvery long-run\u201d money adaptation predicts FICO credit scores; low planners thus face materially higher cost of credit.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/108/1816744","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and planning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We propose that when experiencing a self-control conflict, consumers intentionally construe temptation as more damaging to the attainment of a long-term goal and use these distorted construals to help resolve the conflict in favor of the goals. Four studies in two self-regulatory domains (a dieting goal and an academic goal) provided converging evidence for the counteractive construal hypothesis. We found that people who were experiencing self-control conflict expected tempting food items to contain more calories or expected parties to take more time away from studying and were consequently less interested in consuming these temptations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/129/1817004","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and self-control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

That people approach positive outcomes is not surprising, but do people also infer an outcome is rewarding from their bodily sensation of approaching it, and does this positivity transfer indirectly to other outcomes linked in memory to the original negative outcome? We posit that, because people usually approach reward, they mistakenly infer that approach must equal reward. Thus, a sensation of approach, even toward a negative outcome, makes them feel more positively toward the negative outcome and associated outcomes. Experiment 1 demonstrates a positive effect of embodied movement in space toward an otherwise aversive product. Experiments 2 and 3 additionally show positive effects of psychological movement in time, using evaluative conditioning procedures, to associated stimuli in memory.

We move beyond individual coping strategies and examine the processes of stigmatization and destigmatization. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption practices of urban Turkish covered women, we explore how veiling, a deviant practice stigmatized in the secular and urban mind-set, first became an attractive choice for some middle-class women and then transformed into a fashionable and ordinary clothing practice for many. We map out the global multi-actored work that underlies the emergence of veiling as an attractive choice and explicate its gradual routinization and destigmatization. We discuss the findings in terms of their implications for understandings of choice and free will, the formative role of fashion in the evolution of a new habitus and social class, and the relationship between the market and religion.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/15/1817296","articles","JCR","Marketing","7","['stigmatization', 'destigmatization', 'fashion', 'choice', 'social class']","The article explores the processes of stigmatization and destigmatization related to veiling, emphasizing social implications and the intersection of fashion and cultural identity.

That is, unexpected subcategory formats help more knowledgeable consumers overcome complacency and benefit more from their shopping experience.

Interestingly, we also find that consumers are relatively well calibrated with regard to the effects of more and less expected subcategory formats, anticipating that less expected formats may help more knowledgeable consumers.

The authors explore the meaning of consumption at multiple self levels and dialogical relationships to manage differences. The study uses mixed methods including in-depth interviews, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and metaphors to distill important voices in their informants. They find that the consumption stories vary across self levels. The meta-self level reflects a dispassionate representation of the primary I-positions in consumers and does not explain what the consumers experience at the time of actual consumption. An examination of inconsistent consumption preferences at the level of I-positions reveals that dialogical relationships labeled compartmentalization, compassion, negotiation, and coalition can avoid and manage conflicts, while relationships involving opposition and domination reflect unresolved conflicts. Suggestions to use the dialogical self model for addressing issues of negative selves, addictions, and domination in future research are provided.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/176/1818500","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['dialogical', 'conflicts', 'compassion', 'negotiation', 'domination']","The article explores the complexities of consumer experiences and relationships, touching on themes of conflict management and compassion, which align with moderate social awareness.

Globalization research suggests that Bourdieu\u2019s status consumption model, based upon Western research, does not provide an adequate explanation. And what we call the global trickle-down model, often invoked to explain LIC status consumption, is even more imprecise. We study the status consumption strategies of upper-middle-class Turkish women in order to revise three of Bourdieu\u2019s most important concepts\u2014cultural capital, habitus, and consumption field\u2014to propose a theory specific to the LIC context. We demonstrate that cultural capital is organized around orthodox practice of the Western Lifestyle myth, that cultural capital is deterritorialized and so accrues through distant textbook-like learning rather than via the habitus, and that the class faction with lower cultural capital indigenizes the consumption field to sustain a national social hierarchy.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/37/1818903","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['status consumption', 'cultural capital', 'social hierarchy']","The article discusses status consumption in less industrialized countries and critiques Western-centric models, indicating an awareness of cultural and social dynamics.

We focus instead on the effects of product scent on consumer memories. For instance, if a pencil or a facial tissue is imbued with scent (vs. not), recall for the brand's other attributes increases significantly\u2014with the effects lasting as much as 2 weeks after exposure. We also find that product scent is more effective than ambient scent at enhancing memory for product information. We suggest that this may be because, with product (ambient) scent, scent-related associations are focused on a single object (are diffused across multiple objects) in the environment. In support, we find that the memory effects are driven by the number of product/scent-related associations stored in long-term memory. The results suggest that, although ambient scent has received the bulk of attention from researchers and managers in recent years, greater focus on product scent is warranted.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/57/1820202","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of scent in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We theorize that mental budgets will lead to greater self-control when the avoidance aspects of the behavior are made salient and when the decision context allows easy monitoring of one's own behavior. Study 1 finds that mental budgets help reduce consumption of indulgent products when avoidance aspects of the behavior are made salient. Study 2 finds that even when avoidance aspects are made salient, mental budgets are effective only when option information enables monitoring of one's choices relative to the budget. Study 3 finds that external reference points (a feature of both studies 1 and 2) play a critical role in reducing consumption. Study 4 extends the findings from studies 1 and 3 and finds that mental budgets are effective in enhancing self-control if the person also has a high chronic prevention focus.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/1/68/2877615","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on self-control and mental budgeting without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, making it primarily technical and profit-focused."],["2011","37","1","Wenbo Wang\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Wenbo Wang\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Hean Tat Keh\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Hean Tat Keh\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Lisa E.

Because a number of articles submitted to JCR follow Baron and Kenny (1986) on mediation analysis, I invited this article to serve as a tutorial on the state of the art in mediation analysis, similar to Fitzsimons's (2008) article on analysis of moderated regression. The article was reviewed with two issues in mind: are the points technically correct, and are the points already known by practicing consumer researchers? Two sets of reviewers were used, methodologists to answer the first question and mainstream users of Baron and Kenny's procedure who are not methodologists to answer the second. \n    \n    \n        Correction.\u2014Since this article was published online on February 15, 2010, a correction has been made. In the second to the last paragraph of the section entitled Recommended Steps for Mediation Analysis, the earlier version read: \u201cSince a \u00d7 b \u00d7 c (\u2212.0002) is negative, it is a competitive mediation\u201d; (\u2212.0002) has now been changed to (\u2212.0030) in both the online and print versions of the article.

Many research projects have been terminated early in a research program or later in the review process because the data did not conform to Baron and Kenny\u2019s criteria, impeding theoretical development. While the technical literature has disputed some of Baron and Kenny\u2019s tests, this literature has not diffused to practicing researchers. We present a nontechnical summary of the flaws in the Baron and Kenny logic, some of which have not been previously noted.

For both positive and negative product experiences, we demonstrate that consumers use more abstract terms when they describe experiences that are in line with the valence of their product attitude. This effect cannot be explained by differences in valence between abstract and concrete language. On the receiver side, abstract language in positive word of mouth leads to (1) the inference that the sender has a more favorable product attitude and (2) a higher buying intention for the product under consideration. The reverse is found for negative word of mouth.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/207/1814144","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer language in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Three experiments showed that consumers perceive nonprofits as being warmer than for-profits but as less competent. Further, consumers are less willing to buy a product made by a nonprofit than a for-profit because of their perception that the firm lacks competence. Consequently, when perceived competence of a nonprofit is boosted through subtle cues that connote credibility, discrepancies in willingness to buy disappear. In fact, when consumers perceive high levels of competence and warmth, they feel admiration for the firm\u2014which translates to consumers\u2019 increased desire to buy.

Three experiments show that different positive emotions (compared with a neutral control condition) have specific effects on judgment that are consistent with the proposed underlying evolved function of each positive emotion. As predicted by the framework, the specific influences of pride and contentment on product desirability are mediated by the triggering of emotion-specific functional motives. Overall, an evolutionary approach presents important research implications and practical applications for how and why discernible positive and negative emotions influence thinking and behavior. We discuss the implications of an evolutionary approach for the study of emotions, highlighting key similarities and differences between this and other approaches, as well as noting the advantages of incorporating an evolutionary approach.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/238/1814375","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on an evolutionary framework for understanding emotions and their impact on product desirability, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The Role of In-Store Slack in Budget Deviation","We propose that consumers have mental budgets for grocery trips that are typically composed of both an itemized portion and in-store slack. We conceptualize the itemized portion as the amount that the consumer has allocated to spend on items planned to the brand or product level and the in-store slack as the portion of the mental budget that is not assigned to be spent on any particular product but remains available for in-store decisions. Using a secondary data set and a field study, we find incidence of in-store slack. Moreover, we find support for our framework predicting that the relationship between in-store slack and budget deviation (the amount by which actual spending deviates from the mental trip budget) depends on factors related to desire and willpower.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/264/1815154","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and budgeting without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning, motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter people\u2019s experience of products and cause them to report more rapid effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the product\u2019s effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing products.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/279/1815395","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product efficacy without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We demonstrate the process by which these effects occur, showing that anger at the uncivil employee induces these effects. We find that anger leads to rumination about the uncivil encounter and causes customers to make quicker and more negative generalizations about related entities. We also identify boundary conditions for the relationship between incivility and negative generalizations.

Mental rehearsal of prices containing numbers with small phonemes results in overestimation of price discounts, whereas mental rehearsal of prices containing numbers with large phonemes results in underestimation. Mental rehearsal of the same sale prices characterized by small phonemes in one language and large phonemes in another language can yield differential effects. For example, when sale prices are rehearsed in English, an | $$ 11.00-$ 7.88$ | (28.4%) discount is perceived as greater than a | $$ 10.00-$ 7.01$ | (29.9%) discount; however, when these same prices are rehearsed in Chinese, the latter discount is perceived as greater. Non-price-related phonemes do not yield these same discount distortions.

Consumers\u2019 reactions to these descriptions depend on whether they perceive themselves to be more or less knowledgeable about the product than others whom the ad is specifically intended to influence. When an ad appears in a professional magazine that is read primarily by experts in the product domain, puffery generally increases the ad\u2019s effectiveness. This is also true when the ad appears in a popular magazine but readers perceive themselves to know less about the product than consumers at large. If readers believe they know as much as or more than general consumers, however, puffery decreases the ad\u2019s effectiveness. In addition, the media context in which an ad is encountered has a direct effect on judgments by consumers who perceive themselves to have little knowledge about the type of product being advertised.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/329/1815926","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['puffery', 'consumer knowledge', 'advertisements']","The article primarily focuses on the effectiveness of puffery in advertisements and consumer perceptions, lacking significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, this article reviews research that shows that in non-Western cultures and among working-class Westerners, freedom and choice do not have the meaning or importance they do for the university-educated people who have been the subjects of almost all research on this topic. We cannot assume that choice, as understood by educated, affluent Westerners, is a universal aspiration. The meaning and significance of choice are cultural constructions. Moreover, even when choice can foster freedom, empowerment, and independence, it is not an unalloyed good. Too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness. In the United States, the path to well-being may require that we strike a balance between the positive and negative consequences of proliferating choice in every domain of life.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/2/344/1816183","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['freedom', 'choice', 'cultural constructions', 'well-being']","The article critiques the Western-centric notion of choice and its implications for well-being, highlighting cultural differences and the potential negative consequences of an overemphasis on personal freedom.

Imposed healthy eating signals that the health goal was sufficiently met, and thus it increases the strength of the conflicting motive to fulfill one\u2019s appetite. Accordingly, consumers asked to sample an item framed as healthy later reported being hungrier and consumed more food than those who sampled the same item framed as tasty or those who did not eat at all. These effects of healthy eating depend on the consumer\u2019s perception that healthy eating is mandatory; therefore, only imposed healthy eating made consumers hungrier, whereas freely choosing to eat healthy did not increase hunger.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/357/1826407","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['healthy eating', 'consumers', 'mandatory']","The article discusses the implications of imposed healthy eating on consumer behavior, touching on themes of personal choice and health mandates.

But as originally conceived, narrative transportation is unlikely to occur in response to advertisements, where persuasive intent is obvious and consumer resistance is expected. We analyze fashion ads to show how narrative transportation can nonetheless be a possible response to ads, if specific aesthetic properties are present, most notably when grotesque imagery is used. We then situate narrative transportation as one of five modes of engaging fashion advertising, each of which serves as a distinct route to persuasion. Interviews showed that consumers variously engage ads to act, identify, feel, transport, or immerse. We explain how aesthetic properties of ads call forth different modes of engagement and explore how grotesque imagery can lead to either narrative transportation or immersion. As routes to persuasion, transportation and immersion work by intensifying brand experience rather than boosting brand evaluation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/368/1826519","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['persuasion', 'narrative', 'consumer', 'engagement']","The article focuses on narrative transportation and consumer engagement in advertising, which are primarily marketing concepts without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This preference holds both when the need to belong is activated in an ego-threatening manner, such as after being socially ostracized, and when it is activated in a non-ego-threatening manner, such as when the interdependent self is primed. Furthermore, the consumption of nostalgic products, rather than the exposure to or the mere selection of nostalgic products, successfully satiates the need to belong.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/393/1827267","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['nostalgic', 'belong', 'consumption']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior related to nostalgia without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A number of studies found strong instances of choice overload in the lab and in the field, but others found no such effects or found that more choices may instead facilitate choice and increase satisfaction. In a meta-analysis of 63 conditions from 50 published and unpublished experiments (N = 5,036), we found a mean effect size of virtually zero but considerable variance between studies. While further analyses indicated several potentially important preconditions for choice overload, no sufficient conditions could be identified. However, some idiosyncratic moderators proposed in single studies may still explain when and why choice overload reliably occurs; we review these studies and identify possible directions for future research.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/409/1827647","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of choice overload without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that because choice overload has multiple antecedents, simply searching for a main effect across all conditions and a single \u201csufficient\u201d condition that is likely to solely predict this effect is not informative. Moreover, because prior research has documented multiple instances in which an abundance of options leads to choice overload, the interesting question is not whether choice overload occurs but when it occurs. The answer to this question is unlikely to stem from testing for the presence of a single main effect using the traditional meta-analytic approach. Instead, research would benefit from a theory-based meta-analysis that tests the validity of a conceptual model of choice overload capturing the underlying psychological processes.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/426/1828761","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the concept of choice overload without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Because there is competition between products in the marketplace, consumption decisions typically present conflict between means to achieve a goal. In this article, we examine the consequences of conflict between regulatory means on consumers\u2019 decisions and show that its resolution depends on whether the means\u2014that is, the attributes\u2014are compatible with the consumer\u2019s regulatory orientation. We show that compatibility with more than one attribute arouses acute decision conflict and evokes decision processes that result in a pronounced tendency to make counternormative choices. We also show that incompatibility with a product\u2019s attributes leads to choosing extreme alternatives, which suggests the presence of a \u201cpick-your-poison\u201d effect. We test our hypotheses using the attraction, compromise, and deferral paradigms. We close by discussing our results in the context of the Lewinian view of decision conflict.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/429/1828782","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This research examines the role of consumers\u2019 need for uniqueness (CNFU) in two common social comparisons: projection and introjection. Consumers project (i.e., rely on their own preferences to estimate those of others), regardless of their CNFU. However, high-CNFU consumers are less likely than low-CNFU ones to introject (i.e., rely on estimates of others\u2019 preferences to gauge their own). Moreover, alleviating the introjection-induced threat to the high-CNFU consumers\u2019 self-concept by having them deliberate on their differentness from others increases their likelihood of introjection. Together, these findings confirm our basic contention that the process underlying introjection is more motivational in nature than that underlying projection.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/443/1828986","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['uniqueness', 'preferences', 'social comparisons']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and motivations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The results of five studies show that, consistent with prior research, participants experienced discomfort when they encountered mixed emotions appeals and developed less favorable attitudes toward the ad relative to pure positive emotional appeals, but this was the case only for those who construed information at a concrete, low level. Participants who construed information at an abstract, high level did not experience much discomfort; hence, they found mixed emotions and pure positive emotional appeals equally persuasive.

Direct attitude change is significantly more robust than indirect attitude change, for example, to changes in the valence of affective stimuli (unconditioned stimulus revaluation: e.g., endorsers falling from grace), to interference by subsequent information (e.g., advertising clutter), and to persuasion knowledge activation (e.g., consumer suspicion about being influenced). Indirect evaluative conditioning requires repeated presentations of a brand with the same affective stimulus. Direct evaluative conditioning requires simultaneous presentation of a brand with different affective stimuli.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/473/1829219","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brand attitude change through evaluative conditioning without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Previous research on legitimacy in consumer behavior has focused on the consumer reception of legitimizing discourse rather than on the historical process of legitimation itself. This study examines the influence of changes in the institutional environment over time on the meaning structures that influence consumer perception and practice. To study legitimation as a historical process, a discourse analysis of newspaper articles about casino gambling from 1980\u20132007 was conducted. Results show that the regulatory approval of gambling is accompanied by a shift in the semantic categories used to discuss casinos and that journalists play a role in shaping these categories. Further, journalists shape the meaning of a consumption practice in three ways: through selection, validation, and realization. Interpreted through the lens of institutional theory, these findings suggest that studies of legitimation should consider changes in public discourse and legal regulation in addition to consumer perceptions of legitimacy.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/490/1829579","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['legitimation', 'discourse', 'institutional environment']","The article discusses the legitimation of consumption practices and the influence of public discourse and regulatory structures, indicating some awareness of social contexts.

In this multisited ethnography, we explore the ways in which active consumers negotiate meanings about the consumption of a particular public good, public space. Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies of public space consumption that result from the interaction, both conflict and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature of space both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across stakeholders and fuels forms of layered agency.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/511/1831321","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['public space', 'collective good', 'belonging', 'dialogue']","The article emphasizes themes of public space as a contested area and the importance of collective ownership and belonging, which align with social justice and community engagement.

We suggest that it is the dimensional overlap in the range of values that contextual and target stimuli might take. Four experiments demonstrate that overlap or lack thereof between context and target ranges determines context effects. Assimilation occurs when the context and target ranges overlap, but contrast occurs when the ranges do not overlap. Furthermore, perceptions of amount of overlap or lack thereof determine the amount of assimilation or contrast. These results occur regardless of whether research participants are asked to explicitly consider ranges or not prior to judgment, whether the context consists of attributes or exemplars, and whether the target is novel or familiar.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/530/1832814","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer judgment without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Four studies demonstrate that while less explicit branding increases the likelihood of misidentification (e.g., observers confusing a high-end purchase for a cheaper alternative), people with more cultural capital in a particular domain prefer subtle signals because they provide differentiation from the mainstream. Such insiders have the necessary connoisseurship to decode the meaning of subtle signals that facilitate communication with others \u201cin the know.\u201d Consistent with the notion that these effects are driven by outward communication, they are stronger in identity-relevant product domains and situations where consumption is more public. This work highlights the communication value of less explicit signals and discusses the implications for branding, signal persistence, and the communication of identity.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/555/1795043","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['identity', 'branding', 'cultural capital']","The article discusses the implications of branding and identity communication, which touches on aspects of cultural sensitivity and consumer identity.

Forming an implementation intention encourages people to develop a plan, to prepare for events that allow for the execution of the plan, and to efficiently respond to these opportunities. Yet, forming an implementation intention may not be universally beneficial. An implementation intention may encourage the use of means that are part of the plan but may discourage the use of efficacious means that are not part of the plan. Four experiments show that forming an implementation intention decreases the likelihood of responding to goal-directed, out-of-plan behaviors when a person is in a concrete mind-set. Limitations, implications, and directions for future research are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/570/1795592","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on goal pursuit and implementation intentions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Given the common mechanism proposed for this effect\u2014a highly involving dissonance reduction process\u2014it would be reasonable to expect such choice enhancement to be quite durable and resistant to later change. Instead, we show the contrary: that difficulty-driven choice enhancement is exceptionally fragile, collapsing easily against even minor attack. In three experiments, consumers make easy or difficult product choices, report attitudes toward their choice, and subsequently encounter a negative customer review. Compared to easy decisions, difficult decisions lead to more extreme initial positivity toward chosen products but also to more vulnerability to subsequent attack. Moreover, this fragile enhancement effect is exacerbated, not ameliorated, by choice involvement. Thus, making difficult decisions between similarly attractive options may motivate a bubble-like inflation of positivity that has some semblance of strength yet remains highly prone to collapse.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/584/1795878","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When Does Massed Learning Improve Product Usage Proficiency?","Previous research has shown that spacing of information (over time) leads to better learning of product information. We develop a theoretical framework to describe how massed or spaced learning schedules interact with different learning styles to influence product usage proficiency. The core finding is that with experiential learning, proficiency in a product usage task is better under massed conditions, whereas with verbal learning, spacing works better. This effect is demonstrated for usage proficiency assessed via speed as well as quality of use. Further, massed learning also results in better usage proficiency on transfer tasks, for both experiential and verbal learning. We also find that massed learning in experiential learning conditions leads not only to better usage proficiency but also to positive perceptions of the product. Overall, the pattern of results is consistent with a conceptual mapping account, with massed experiences leading to a superior mental model of usage and thus to better usage proficiency.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/599/1796063","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on learning schedules and product usage proficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To examine this issue, in two experiments implicit attitudes were created by evaluative conditioning where the participants were unaware of the contingencies. This creates an \u201cI like it, but I don\u2019t know why\u201d effect. The participants also had conflicting product information available in memory. We find that the participants rely on their implicit attributes when making a brand choice if they have not formed an explicit evaluation based on the product attribute information. This occurs even when the attribute information is available in memory and the participants are highly motivated to retrieve it. These findings provide evidence that implicit attitudes can have a significant influence on behavior, despite conflicting product information, and increased levels of motivation and opportunity.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/614/1796248","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['implicit attitudes', 'consumer behavior', 'brand choice']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Results from three experiments yield two primary findings. First, promotion-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more global level, whereas prevention-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more local level. Second, promotion-focused consumers tend to have larger consideration sets than do prevention-focused consumers. Building on these two primary findings, it is additionally shown that whereas promotion-focused consumers attach relatively greater value to options chosen from hierarchically structured sets, prevention-focused consumers attach relatively greater value to options chosen from nonhierarchically structured item lists. Finally, whereas promotion-focused consumers attach significantly greater value to options chosen from larger sets than to options chosen from smaller sets, prevention-focused consumers do not attach significantly less value to options chosen from larger sets than to options chosen from smaller sets.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/626/1796351","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When progress on achieving a goal is low, people are concerned about its attainability. Because attributing low progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a higher difficulty of goal attainment, it leads to lower goal commitment and, subsequently, decreased motivation. Conversely, when progress on achieving the goal is high and attainment of the goal is relatively secured, people are more concerned about the value of the goal. Because attributing a high progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a greater value of the goal, it should lead to greater goal commitment and, subsequently, higher motivation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/641/1796463","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['commitment', 'motivation', 'goal']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and motivation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Entity theorists perceive themselves to be better looking, more feminine, and more glamorous after using a Victoria\u2019s Secret shopping bag (study 1) and more intelligent, more of a leader, and harder working after using an MIT pen (study 2); incremental theorists are unaffected. In two subsequent studies, we find that entity theorists use brands with appealing personalities to signal their positive qualities, thereby enhancing self-perceptions in line with the brand\u2019s personality.

We conceptualize the aficionado as having asymmetric perceptual and conceptual knowledge and posit that when these two types of knowledge are bridged with a sensory consumption vocabulary, the aficionados are better able to learn from their experiences. In experiment 1, we find that providing aficionados a cross-modal learning tool (wine aroma wheel) during their tasting helps them strengthen their experiential memory and withstand influence from misleading marketing communications. We also find that when aficionados are presented with a misleading consumption vocabulary during their tasting, they more readily accept the marketing misinformation that results in memory distortion. In experiment 2, we find that accurate multisensory information delivered through either the wine aroma wheel or advertising can enhance how aficionados learn from their direct tasting experience.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/688/1796793","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['misleading marketing', 'experiential memory', 'sensory consumption']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, this influence is attenuated when positive mood is accompanied by elevated arousal.

We introduce the notion that costs and benefits can occur either in the same accounting period (day, season, etc.) or in different periods. Our key argument is that monetary costs are tracked across accounting periods but that temporal costs are written off at the end of the period in which they are incurred. Thus, accounting periods lead to a time-money asymmetry in the tracking of costs and, consequently, in the likelihood of seeking benefits.

In this article, we identify a systematic pessimism in predictions of such skill learning occurring in the initial skill-acquisition phase of product use. After initially trying new products, people underpredict how quickly they will acquire the skills required for product use. Further, we find that this underprediction of learning is due to a failure to appreciate how rapidly task experience leads to a shift from system 2 to system 1 processing.

We provide a theoretical corrective to this tendency by investigating consumers who have become vested in a commercially mythologized consumption field through an incremental process of building social connections and cultural capital. For these consumers, the prevailing marketplace myth is experienced as a trivialization of their aesthetic interests, rather than as a source of identity value. In response, they employ demythologizing practices to insulate their acquired field-dependent social and cultural capital from devaluation.

We manipulated fluency by varying the font of product descriptions or the number of thoughts we asked participants to recall. Our studies showed that fluency increased confidence for people processing at lower construal levels but decreased confidence for those processing at higher construal levels.

Our central thesis, and a central finding of all four experiments, is that disclosure of private information is responsive to environmental cues that bear little connection, or are even inversely related, to objective hazards. We address underlying processes and rule out alternative explanations by eliciting subjective judgments of the sensitivity of inquiries (experiment 3) and by showing that the effect of cues diminishes if privacy concern is activated at the outset of the experiment (experiment 4).

The results show that when sequential data are relatively easier to mathematically combine (e.g., percentage data), consumers revise their judgments in a way that is consistent with an averaging model but inconsistent with the normative Bayesian model. However, when the sequential data are difficult to mathematically combine (e.g., frequency data), consumers update their confidence judgments in a way that is more consistent with the normative Bayesian model than with an averaging model. Interestingly, greater processing motivation for sequential frequency data leads to updated confidence judgments that are lower than normative Bayesian predictions but consistent with the averaging model. Overall, the results of the experiments reveal counterintuitive findings; updated confidence judgments are higher and more accurate when sequential data are more difficult to process and also when consumers have lower processing motivation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/5/874/1869721","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer confidence and data processing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Earn 10 [1] points/dollar\u201d). The program medium presents two key pieces of information: reward distance (points required to redeem reward) and step size (points earned per dollar). In higher-magnitude (vs. lower-magnitude) programs, both reward distances (1,000 vs. 100) and step sizes (10 vs. 1 point[s]/dollar) are larger. How do these two pieces of information affect consumers' postenrollment inferences of progress, store loyalty, and recommendation likelihood? Do consumers always integrate both pieces? We identify a moderator, step-size ambiguity, and show that when ambiguity is high, only reward distance affects inferences. When ambiguity is lower, consumers integrate step size with reward distance, but in a biased manner. Implications arise in goal following and in physical and psychological distance estimation contexts (e.g., weight loss, savings) where distances and step sizes can vary (e.g., as a function of units: kilograms vs. pounds), but especially in loyalty rewards contexts.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/5/888/1870004","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of loyalty programs and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that social exclusion causes people to spend and consume strategically in the service of affiliation. Relative to controls, excluded participants were more likely to buy a product symbolic of group membership (but not practical or self-gift items), tailor their spending preferences to the preferences of an interaction partner, spend money on an unappealing food item favored by a peer, and report being willing to try an illegal drug, but only when doing so boosted their chances of commencing social connections.

This effect was observed using a variety of power manipulations (hierarchical roles, print advertisements, episodic recall, and mental role-playing), across spending intentions and actual dollars spent, and among college and national samples. We propose that this effect occurs because power and powerlessness affect the psychological utility of self versus others, and this in turn affects the monetary worth allocated to spending on self versus others.

Results show that the outcome of a self-made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian.

However, we show that perceived usage frequency relative to other consumers can influence product interest more than absolute usage frequency. In five studies, we use scale labels, advertisements, and customer reviews to invoke either a high-frequency or low-frequency norm. We show that high-frequency cues create less product interest and lower willingness to pay than low-frequency cues because consumers infer that their relative usage frequency will be lower, reducing the product's perceived fit.

For example, women at peak fertility (near ovulation) are attracted to different kinds of men and show increased desire to attend social gatherings. Building on the evolutionary logic behind such effects, we examined how, why, and when hormonal fluctuations associated with ovulation influenced women's product choices. In three experiments, we show that at peak fertility women nonconsciously choose products that enhance appearance (e.g., choosing sexy rather than more conservative clothing). This hormonally regulated effect appears to be driven by a desire to outdo attractive rival women. Consequently, minimizing the salience of attractive women who are potential rivals suppresses the ovulatory effect on product choice.

For instance, exposure to the retailer brand name \u201cWalmart,\u201d typically associated with saving money, reduces subsequent spending, whereas exposure to the Walmart slogan, \u201cSave money. Live better,\u201d increases it. Slogans cause reverse priming effects and brands cause priming effects because people perceive slogans, but not brands, as persuasion tactics. The reverse priming effect is driven by a nonconscious goal to correct for bias and can occur without any conscious mediation (i.e., following subliminal exposure to the word \u201cslogan\u201d).

For large stocks in particular, AT narrows spreads, reduces adverse selection, and reduces trade-related price discovery.

The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors' net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We find strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller.

S&P/Barra follow a simple mechanical procedure to define their Value and Growth indices. In doing so, they reclassify some stocks from Value to Growth even after their book-to-market ratios have risen, and vice versa. Such stocks begin to covary more with the index they join and less with the index they leave. Backdated constituent data from Barra reveal no such label-related shifts in comovement during the 10 years prior to the actual introduction of the indices in 1992.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01633.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the impact of index labels on stock returns, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2011","66","2","EFRAIM BENMELECH,\u00a0\n                     EFRAIM BENMELECHSearch for more papers by this authorNITTAI K.

We propose and analyze a collateral channel in which a firm's bankruptcy reduces the collateral value of other industry participants, thereby increasing their cost of debt financing. We identify the collateral channel using novel data of secured debt tranches issued by U.S. airlines that include detailed descriptions of the underlying collateral pools. Our estimates suggest that industry bankruptcies have a sizeable impact on the cost of debt financing of other industry participants. We discuss how the collateral channel may lead to contagion effects that amplify the business cycle during industry downturns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01636.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bankruptcy and its impact on debt financing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To isolate the coordination channel from lenders' joint reaction to new information, we exploit a natural experiment that forced lenders to share negative private assessments about their borrowers. We show that lenders, while learning nothing new about the firm, reduce credit in anticipation of other lenders' reaction to the negative news about the firm.

An often-cited motivation for these transactions is market timing, and managers' decision to issue puts should be sensitive to whether the stock is undervalued. We provide new evidence that large firms successfully time security sales. In the 100 days following put option issues, there is roughly a 5% abnormal stock return, with much of the abnormal return following the first earnings release date after the sale.

These firms make better acquisition decisions, have greater cash holdings, and overstate earnings less often.

To arrive at these conclusions, we construct an optimal Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator for models in which the stochastic discount factor (SDF) is a conditionally affine function of a set of priced risk factors, and we show that there is an optimal choice of managed portfolios to use in testing a null model against a proposed alternative generalized SDF.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01654.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2011","66","3","JACK BAO,\u00a0\n                     JACK BAOSearch for more papers by this authorJUN PAN,\u00a0\n                     JUN PANSearch for more papers by this authorJIANG WANG,\u00a0\n                     JIANG WANG\n                     Bao is from Ohio State University, Fisher College of Business.

Using transactions data from 2003 to 2009, we show that the illiquidity in corporate bonds is substantial, significantly greater than what can be explained by bid\u2013ask spreads. We establish a strong link between bond illiquidity and bond prices. In aggregate, changes in market-level illiquidity explain a substantial part of the time variation in yield spreads of high-rated (AAA through A) bonds, overshadowing the credit risk component. In the cross-section, the bond-level illiquidity measure explains individual bond yield spreads with large economic significance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01655.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate bond liquidity and pricing without any reference to social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We explore the effects of these arrangements on fund size, flows, performance, and investor welfare. Kickbacks allow higher management fees to be charged, thereby lowering net returns.

Our findings suggest that counterparty risk plays a larger role than does liquidity hoarding: the day after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, loan terms become more sensitive to borrower characteristics. In particular, poorly performing large banks see an increase in spreads of 25 basis points, but are borrowing 1% less, on average. Worse performing banks do not hoard liquidity. While the interbank market does not freeze entirely, it does not seem to expand to meet latent demand.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01670.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of the financial crisis, specifically liquidity and counterparty risk, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We show that, unlike binding voting, nonbinding voting generally fails to convey shareholder views when manager and shareholder interests are not aligned. Surprisingly, the presence of an activist investor who can discipline the manager may enhance the advisory role of nonbinding voting only if conflicts of interest between shareholders and the activist are substantial.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01682.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['shareholder activism', 'nonbinding voting', 'manager interests']","The article discusses shareholder activism and the dynamics of voting, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of voting mechanisms rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

We do so using an extensive, hand-collected data set on corporate hedging activities. Hedging can lower the odds of negative realizations, thereby reducing the expected costs of financial distress. In theory, this should ease a firm's access to credit. Using a tax-based instrumental variable approach, we show that hedgers pay lower interest spreads and are less likely to have capital expenditure restrictions in their loan agreements. These favorable financing terms, in turn, allow hedgers to invest more. Our tests characterize two exact channels\u2014cost of borrowing and investment restrictions\u2014through which hedging affects corporate outcomes. The analysis shows that hedging has a first-order effect on firm financing and investment, and provides new insights into how hedging affects corporate value.

As a result, it is cheaper for firms to motivate him to pursue valuable risky projects. When compensation endogenously adjusts to reflect outside opportunities, moderate levels of overconfidence lead firms to offer the manager flatter compensation contracts that make him better off. Overconfident managers are also more attractive to firms than their rational counterparts because overconfidence commits them to exert effort to learn about projects. Still, too much overconfidence is detrimental to the manager since it leads him to accept highly convex compensation contracts that expose him to excessive risk.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01686.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on managerial behavior and compensation contracts, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2011","66","5","ADAIR MORSE,\u00a0\n                     ADAIR MORSESearch for more papers by this authorVIKRAM NANDA,\u00a0\n                     VIKRAM NANDASearch for more papers by this authorAMIT SERU,\u00a0\n                     AMIT SERU\n                     Morse and Seru are with the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and Nanda is with the Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management.

A simple model formalizes this intuition and gives an explicit structural form on the rigged incentive portion of CEO wage function.

Moreover, a firm with rigged incentive pay that is one standard deviation above the mean faces a subsequent decrease of 4.8% in firm value and 7.5% in operating return on assets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01687.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['rigged', 'incentive', 'performance measures']","The article discusses the manipulation of incentive contracts by powerful CEOs, which touches on ethical concerns regarding fairness in compensation.

Evidence from the Loan Syndication Market","We investigate the effect of poor performance on financial intermediary reputation by estimating the effect of large-scale bankruptcies among a lead arranger's borrowers on its subsequent syndication activity. Consistent with reputation damage, such lead arrangers retain larger fractions of the loans they syndicate, are less likely to syndicate loans, and are less likely to attract participant lenders. The consequences are more severe when borrower bankruptcies suggest inadequate screening or monitoring by the lead arranger. However, the effect of borrower bankruptcies on syndication activity is not present among dominant lead arrangers, and is weak in years in which many lead arrangers experience borrower bankruptcies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01692.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of financial performance and reputation without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consequently, public firms adopt riskier and more aggressive output market strategies than private firms, which improves the competitive position of the former vis-\u00e0-vis the latter. This strategic benefit of being public, and thus, the proportion of public firms in an industry, is shown to be positively related to the degree of competitive interaction among firms in the output market, to demand uncertainty, and to the idiosyncratic portion of this uncertainty.

In our model, an employee of a firm generates an idea for a new project that can be financed either by issuing equity against the cash flows of the entire firm (\u201cintegration\u201d), or by undertaking an equity carve-out of the new project alone (\u201cnon-integration\u201d). While the patent underlying the new project is owned by the firm, the employee generating the idea needs to be motivated to exert optimal effort for the project to be successful. The firm's choice between integration and non-integration is driven primarily by heterogeneity in beliefs among outside investors (each of whom has limited wealth to invest in the equity market) and between firm insiders and outsiders: if the marginal outsider financing the new project is more optimistic about the prospects of the project than firm insiders, and this incremental optimism of the marginal outsider over firm insiders is greater regarding new-project cash flows than that about assets-in-place cash flows, then the firm will implement the project under non-integration rather than integration.

Various forms of government intervention, such as benefit guarantees, can alter this outcome dramatically by providing the firm with an incentive to shift risk to other parties.

We solve for the decision of each firm to go public versus remain private, and the optimal timing of going public. In equilibrium, even firms with sufficient internal capital to fund their new investment may go public, driven by the possibility of their product market competitors going public. IPO waves may arise in equilibrium even in industries which do not experience a productivity shock.

This shift has stimulated the accumulation of organizational capital in existing firms and reduced the need for reallocating workers to new firms. We characterize the optimal managerial compensation contract when firms accumulate organizational capital but risk-averse managers cannot commit to staying with the firm. A calibrated version of the model reproduces the increase in managerial compensation inequality and the increased sensitivity of pay to performance in the data over the last three decades.

Dyer and Chu's award-winning JIBS paper demonstrated that trust was best predicted by organizational processes that developed positive expectations of predictability, reliability, and competence, not only within national boundaries but also in cross-national relationships. This review of recent trust research building on Dyer and Chu draws attention to six themes: (1) new conceptualizations that explore identity, roles, and rules as foundations of presumptive trust at the organizational level; (2) dynamics of trust and distrust over time, how violations of trust are interpreted, and what affects ease of repair; (3) pendulum swings in inter-organizational relationships, arising from plural governance and alternation between modes, but also resulting in the continuous coexistence of positive and negative states; (4) the impact of intra-organizational conflict and inter-organizational coalitions on the establishment and maintenance of trust; (5) the relative impact of nation-level vs organization-level differences in culture as influences on trust; and (6) whether intermediate modes of exchange in between transactional and relational modes are unstable, transitional hybrids or embody complementarities that yield both value and stability.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2010.54","commentary","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'identity', 'culture']","The article discusses themes of trust and identity within organizational contexts, which hints at social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

Building on contract-relational duality, we develop a market-level construct for capturing consumers\u2019 socially constructed mental models for the institutional logics of market action.

We therefore build on socialization theory and introduce national business ideology as a country-level determinant of employees\u2019 prosocial values. We thus argue that transformational leadership and professional altruism are key elements of a national business ideology's stimulation of employees\u2019 prosocial values, while corporate corruption is considered to be an impediment.

This finding suggests that creditor protection substitutes for covenants in reducing the agency cost of debt. In contrast, bonds of firms with stronger shareholder rights or firms with stronger firm-level corporate governance use more covenants. These findings support the notion that firms with stronger shareholder control may face an increase in the shareholder\u2013bondholder conflict and therefore prefer to use more covenants.

We collected citation exchanges among these 39 journals from 2000 through 2007. A log-multiplicative model evaluated multiple dimensions of association to determine the sources and storers of knowledge within the network. The network from Pathfinder analysis was used to determine each journal's contribution to network entropy. These analyses indicate that IB journals functioned as storers, not sources, of ideas within the sampled knowledge network over the studied period.

Employing a hierarchical linear model distinguishing firm-level from country-level variables, and a data set covering over 8000 foreign joint ventures in China from 32 different countries and regions in the year 2002, we find that mastery has negative and significant direct effects on foreign joint ventures\u2019 leverage and short-term debt decisions, and a positive and significant direct effect on the likelihood of foreign joint ventures having long-term debt.

We reveal that this variation in owner-manager internationalisation practices is determined by their understandings of internationalisation, which produce differences in the ways activities within their internationalisation activity cycle are orchestrated.

Moreover, changes in accounting rules in Japan that revalued bank assets (similar to the relaxation of mark-to-market requirements for banks in the US) did not increase aggregate Japanese bank lending, but rather reallocated it. Capital constraints during the crisis also induced many Japanese banks to close their overseas branches and switch their charters from international to domestic.

Therefore, corporate headquarters (HQ) involvement in these processes becomes a major issue. A typical assumption in international business (IB) theory is that HQ, based on its own knowledge, makes rational choices about its own involvement. However, according to some studies, HQ involvement can be assumed to be less rational, in the sense that it reflects not HQ knowledge but the normative expectations associated with the role of HQ as top manager. The purpose of this paper is to contrast these two perspectives by exploring their implications regarding the relationship between HQ knowledge about and HQ involvement in innovation processes at the subsidiary level, and regarding the impact of this potential involvement on innovation processes performance. The analysis results in six propositions and an illustrative case. Our contribution to IB research is primarily theoretical: we bring to the scene an alternative approach \u2013 the sheer ignorance perspective \u2013 with the potential to explain the behavior of key actors in the MNE.

However, as subsidiaries evolve, commitments may be decreased as well as increased, a phenomenon that has rarely been studied. Moreover, it remains an open question why strategic intentions at the outset of an investment project differ from the actual operations established. We address these questions by extending the model and combining it with Mintzberg and Waters\u2019 framework of strategy formation. Specifically, we suggest that commitment decisions correspond to statements of intended strategy, while network positions correspond to realized strategies. The processes of learning, opportunity creation and trust building triggered by commitment decisions are, however, moderated by institutional influences that lead to divergences between realized and intended strategies. We test propositions derived from this framework on a survey data set of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises in Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, and find that institutional voids and institutional uncertainty affect subsidiary strategy implementation, but in opposing directions. Under high institutional uncertainty, investors prefer low commitment but flexible modes that enable later commitment increases, whereas institutional voids increase up-front information search and adaptation costs that reduce the likelihood of early post-entry adjustments.

Using data from close to 10,000 firms from more than 30 emerging markets, this paper investigates how, over time, leverage is determined by firms\u2019 business models, and also by the overall country environment. I find significant changes over the last two decades. In the early 1990s, country characteristics dominated firm characteristics, and it was difficult for firms to overcome the limitations of their domestic environment. As emerging markets became better integrated with the world economy, the importance of firm characteristics has increased. At the end of the sample period, emerging-market capital structure determinants resemble those of developed markets, and country characteristics have become less important in explaining financing structures. I also show how, over the last two decades, the maturity structure of debt has changed, and that in recent years firms with more tangible assets are able to attract more debt financing. Overall, I conclude that financing choices in emerging markets are now being made in the same way as in developed markets. This means that emerging-market firms now rely much more on their own strengths when obtaining debt than on country characteristics.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2011.27","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['emerging markets', 'capital structure', 'financing']","The article primarily focuses on financing policies and capital structures of emerging-market firms without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This study theorizes and empirically demonstrates that born global firms stick to a dominant internationalization path over subsequent periods. Arguably, this phenomenon reflects managerial efforts to reduce the perceived risk of internationalization, and their preference to develop and leverage capabilities that are specific to either of the internationalization paths until the economies of further expanding this path are exhausted.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2011.31","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the internationalization strategies of 'born global' firms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To illuminate these issues, we draw on a longitudinal in-depth study of Swedish home furnishing giant IKEA, involving more than 70 interviews. We find that IKEA has developed organizational mechanisms that support an ongoing learning process aimed at frequent modification of the format for replication. Another finding is that IKEA treats replication as hierarchical: lower-level features (marketing efforts, pricing, etc.) are allowed to vary across IKEA stores in response to market-based learning, while higher-level features (fundamental values, vision, etc.) are replicated in a uniform manner across stores, and change only very slowly (if at all) in response to learning (\u201cflexible replication\u201d).

Relying on Kalman filtering, the authors develop a methodology to assess the effects from DTCA and DTP on three components of shareholder value: stock return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Investors value DTCA positively because it leads to higher stock returns and lower systematic risk. Furthermore, DTCA increases idiosyncratic risk, which does not affect investors who maintain well-diversified portfolios.

These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition.

The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store.

The authors investigate the drivers and outcomes of this phenomenon using a hierarchical measure of power for the CMO in the top management team (TMT), or corporate executive suite (C-suite). Theory suggests that CMO power in the TMT should increase with (1) the CMO's control over resources required by other executives in the C-suite, (2) the criticality and (3) effective provision of these resources, and (4) the nonsubstitutability and (5) centrality of the CMO. The authors use these rationales to identify factors that affect CMO power in public U.S. firms with the CMO position for at least two of the five observed years. The findings show that CMO power increases when the CMO has the additional responsibility of sales, as TMT marketing experience decreases, and as firms with low levels of TMT marketing experience pursue innovation. Furthermore, CMO power in highly divisionalized TMTs and the CMO's additional responsibility of sales improve sales growth, but CMO power in firms that are unrelated diversifiers reduces profitability.

The authors examine the conditions under which each theory would apply and derive testable implications from the data.

The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights.

In this article, the authors investigate whether firms should spend more on research and development (R&D) and advertising in recessions. They propose that the effects of changes in firms\u2019 R&D and advertising spending in recessions on profits and stock returns are contingent on their market share, financial leverage, and product-market profile (i.e., business-to-consumer goods, business-to-business services, business-to-business goods, or business-to-consumer services). They estimate the model using a panel of more than 10,000 firm-years of publicly listed U.S. firms from 1969 to 2008, during which there were seven recessions. Their results support the contingency approach. The authors compute the marginal effects, which show how the effects of changes in R&D and advertising spending in recessions vary across firms. The marginal effects provide evidence of inadequate spending (e.g., 98% of business-to-consumer goods firms underspend on R&D), proactivity (e.g., 96% of business-to-business services firms are at approximately the right levels on advertising). and excess spending (e.g., 92% of business-to-consumer services firms overspend on advertising). Using the authors\u2019 approach and publicly available data, managers can estimate the effects of their firms\u2019 and competitors\u2019 R&D and advertising spending on profits and stock returns in recessions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.3.49","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['spending', 'recessions', 'profits']","The article primarily focuses on marketing spending during recessions and its impact on profits and stock returns, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This repositioning is welcomed by managers who believe that by positioning their brands as means for self-expression, they are less likely to go head-to-head with their direct competitors. However, the authors argue that by doing so, these companies expose themselves to much broader, cross-category competition for a share of a consumer's identity. Thus, they propose that consumers\u2019 need for self-expression through brands is finite and can be satiated when consumers are exposed to self-expressive brands. Moreover, they argue that consumers\u2019 need for self-expression can be satiated not only by a brand's direct competitors but also by brands from unrelated product categories, nonbrand means of self-expression, and self-expressive behavioral acts. The authors examine these propositions in a series of five empirical studies that provide converging evidence in support of the notion that the need for self-expression can be satiated, thus weakening preferences for lifestyle brands.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.3.66","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['self-expression', 'identity', 'branding']","The article discusses consumer identity and self-expression in branding, which touches on individualistic themes but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

The authors recognize two distinct forms of dyadic interdependency: process interdependency, in which each party's enactment of behavior influences the other's enactment of behavior, and outcome interdependency, in which the impact of each party's behavior on service outcome depends on the other party's behavior. Using the interpersonal circumplex model and its related concept of complementarity, the authors examine both forms of dyadic interdependency by directly observing provider\u2013client interpersonal behaviors in a natural frontline service setting over an extended period. The findings on process interdependency indicate that dyadic behaviors elicit or inhibit each other largely in a complementary manner. The findings on outcome interdependency show that, in general, complementary interactions between the provider and client enhance the client's satisfaction, whereas anticomplementary interactions dampen the client's satisfaction.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.3.83","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['interdependency', 'behavior', 'satisfaction']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of service encounters and the interrelated behaviors of providers and clients, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Surprisingly, at low levels of perceived unfairness, conflict and opportunism have small or even insignificant effects on channel member outcomes, which implies that research investigating the negative impact of conflict and opportunism on exchange outcomes may need reevaluation because these effects are contingent and may vary depending on the levels of perceived unfairness.

With this central thesis in mind, he examines the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) as an illustrative case study to identify areas of inquiry that are both novel and highly managerially relevant. This analysis reveals that of the seven core tasks of the CMO, three have been lightly investigated.

This study examines such line extensions by testing middle-quality brands (e.g., Giovanni's pasta sauce [fictitious], Foster's beer [real]) that offer higher-quality (e.g., Giovanni's Magnifico) or lower-quality line extensions (e.g., Foster's Grog). A robust asymmetry emerges in which higher-quality extensions improve brand evaluation far more than lower-quality extensions damage it. The asymmetry prevails across various perceptual and evaluative dimensions, multiple product classes, numerous fictitious and real brands that differ on various dimensions (familiarity, liking, personality, and prestige), and consumer regulatory focus. Group and individual-level tests show that the standard asymmetry is the modal pattern (though not universal) and that it is associated with two primary underlying processes: (1) opponent processes produced by lower-quality extensions whose negative quality-association effects are tempered by positive variety effects (in general, consumers prefer broader product lines) and (2) best-of-brand processing, in which consumers consider higher-quality extensions more relevant to brand evaluation than lower-quality extensions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.4.3","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on brand management and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

On the basis of two empirical studies of 167 brands (evaluated by 1329 and 980 consumers), the authors show that the implications of self-congruence for consumers\u2019 emotional brand attachment are complex and differ by consumers\u2019 product involvement, consumers\u2019 individual difference variables, and the type of self-congruence (fit of the brand's personality with the consumer's actual self versus with the consumer's ideal self).

However, creativity continues to be a construct that is not well understood in marketing, and little research has examined the joint influence of such initiatives on creative outcomes. As a result, there is considerable variance in the way firms approach these issues. A qualitative study of 20 firms indicates that 15 offered some type of incentive program, whereas only 7 engaged in creativity training (a subset of the firms used both). Given that previous research has consistently found that extrinsic rewards offered in isolation actually undermine the creative process (by reducing intrinsic motivation), it seems that many firms may be unwittingly hampering their own creative efforts. However, two experiments demonstrate that the effect of rewards can be made positive if offered in conjunction with appropriate training. Specifically, product creativity was highest when the monetary reward was paired with a dedicated creative training technique. The training alters the influence of the reward such that it reinforces, rather than undermines, intrinsic motivation. Managers can improve the effectiveness of their creative efforts by leveraging the use of incentives and training in combination.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.4.53","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['creativity', 'incentive programs', 'training']","The article discusses creativity and training in the context of product development, but it primarily focuses on improving business outcomes rather than addressing social justice or equity themes.

The authors extend those studies in two ways. First, they broaden the proxy for marketing by considering both advertising and sales force. Second, they offer an explanation for the fact that some studies linking advertising to firm value find a positive relationship, whereas others find a negative relationship. The accounting literature suggests that the link to firm value for both unexpected growth in sales force expenditures and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures should be negative. The authors confirm the hypothesized accounting relationship for sales force expenditures but find a contingent relationship for advertising expenditures. Firm value and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures are negatively related for firms that advertise below the advertising response threshold, but they are positively related for firms that advertise above that threshold. Perhaps because this contingent relationship is difficult for analysts to learn through observation of the stock market, analysts ignore value-relevant advertising expenditure information when they forecast firm value.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.4.68","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the relationship between marketing expenditures and firm value without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on overall attitude toward the firm, but only for consumers with a prevention, rather than promotion, focus.

In this research, the authors examine three key drivers of relational communication effectiveness: volume of communication, mix of communication channels, and alignment of those channels with customers\u2019 preferences. They hypothesize that customer response to relational communication follows a continuum in which reciprocity explains response to lower levels of communication, the classic ideal point describes a transition phase, and reactance explains response to higher levels of communication. They empirically test the theoretical framework by examining the impact of multichannel communication on repurchase over a three-year period. The results indicate that after the ideal level of communication is exceeded, customers react negatively. This negative response can be exacerbated by the use of multiple channels but attenuated by aligning channels with customer preferences.

In this research, the authors examine whether factors under the firm's control (i.e., the level of design support provided and the presence of a strong brand) are differentially effective when consumers design products for themselves or as gifts for others. Using participants drawn from the relevant target market, they report two studies involving real customization tasks undertaken on fully functioning customization websites. The findings lead to the surprising conclusion that design support is less effective for consumers designing products intended as gifts rather than for themselves, raising expectations without a corresponding rise in evaluations. However, the results offer some good news to firms targeting gift-giving consumers. Both Studies 1 and 2 reveal that gift-givers place a higher value on their own time and effort and thus report a higher willingness to pay than those designing for themselves.

Their test of the model using category and financial growth data from U.S. supermarket chains shows that more intensive CM improves results. Furthermore, use of a category captain increases CM effort and results, without increasing opportunism or problems with other suppliers. The authors also find that retailers with more resources are less likely to rely on help from a category captain; yet the level of retailer resources is not related to CM intensity. Thus, \u201cgo-it-alone\u201d retailers do not deploy their own resources on CM and miss out on the corresponding performance improvements.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.75.5.18","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of retail category management and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The empirical results show that the best seeding strategies can be up to eight times more successful than other seeding strategies. Seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns.

To prevent regret, many retailers promise to refund money to consumers who discover lower prices after purchase. The authors show that a refund's effect on felt regret depends on how consumers view these promises. If consumers mainly view them as protective tools (i.e., adopt a protection focus), postrefund regret is minimal. If consumers primarily view such promises as sources of information about the retailer's price status (i.e., adopt an information focus), regret persists even after refund. The authors show that regret persists with these consumers because finding a lower price results in a perception of trust violation. They find that subject to boundary conditions, using a disclaimer that states that the retailer does not claim to offer the lowest prices helps avoid this negative outcome for information-focused consumers.

The product search maps also inform manufacturers about the competitive structure in the industry and the contents of consumer consideration sets. The proposed method defines a product search network, consisting of the products and links that designate whether a product is searched conditional on searching other products. The authors model this network using a stochastic, hierarchical, and asymmetric multidimensional scaling framework and decompose the product locations as well as the product-level influences using product attributes. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the authors simultaneously visualize the positions of products and the direction of consumer search over products in a perceptual map of search proximity.

When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed.

Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into the unobservable network of influences among consumers.

Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove\u2013Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain.

The authors empirically rule out alternative explanations, including diminishing marginal utility, normative and descriptive utility-based models, liquidity constraints, and naive diversification.

Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors. An interesting counterintuitive finding is that the average influential power of individuals decreases with the total number of their contacts.

Together, the results indicate that positive affect promotes cognitive flexibility and fosters a higher level of thinking and a more future-oriented time perspective, without obscuring practical considerations and other needed detail, including context and opportunity costs, when evaluating intertemporal options.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.532","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processes related to consumer behavior and self-control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

They find that when endogenously evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the weaker competitor wins it. Furthermore, the authors show that the bidding outcome might not align with the relative competitive strength, and an advantaged firm might not be able to win the prominent position even when it values that position. They derive two-dimensional equilibrium price dispersion with the realized prices at the same position varying and the expected prices differing across different positions.

For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a \u201cwinner's curse\u201d: Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility.

Because customers in the preference minority face higher offline shopping costs, they are also less price sensitive.

The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion, advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing customers while taking into account the development of customer demand over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right product to the right customer at the right time using the right communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors demonstrate that households have different preferences and responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%) and instantaneous promotional effect (2%). The cross-selling solicitations resulting from the proposed framework are more customized and dynamic and improve immediate response rate by 56%, long-term response rate by 149%, and long-term profit by 177%.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.683","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['customer demand', 'preferences', 'educational role']","The article focuses primarily on optimizing cross-selling strategies for profit maximization without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample.

This effect seems to be caused by differences in relaxed and nonrelaxed people's mental construals of the value of the products.

In this article, the authors argue that even if the no-choice option is not selected, its mere presence in the choice set may alter consumers' choices. More specifically, they investigate how decision processes and preferences change when consumers have a no-choice option versus when they are forced to choose from a given choice set. They propose that the inclusion of a no-choice option in a choice set affects preferences by leading consumers to determine not only which alternative is best, but which, if any, are acceptable (i.e., meet the consumer's minimum needs). Accordingly, the authors demonstrate that the inclusion of a no-choice option in the choice set (1) leads to more alternative- (rather than attribute-) based information processing, (2) increases the importance of attributes that are more meaningful when alternatives are evaluated one by one (i.e., enriched attributes), and (3) increases the importance of attributes with levels that are closer to the consumer's minimum needs (thresholds).

The results show that, in general, consumers possessing interdependent self-construals prefer donations to a greater extent than those with independent self-construals.

Two often-cited drivers of these profits are cross-channel substitution among posttheatrical channels and seasonality in consumer preferences for any movie. The authors use a differentiated products version of the multiplicative competitive interaction model to investigate these two phenomena. They estimate the model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in the U.S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.07.0359","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market demand and consumer behavior in the motion picture industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, when a product is positioned on experiential dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent form than for moderately incongruent form.

Specifically, do the number of identity claims and their content influence lending decisions, and can they predict the longer-term performance of funded loans? Using data from the peer-to-peer lending website Prosper.com, the authors find that unverifiable information affects lending decisions above and beyond the influence of objective, verifiable information. As the number of identity claims in narratives increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers, because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan.

To experimentally examine how consumers manage multiple debts, the authors develop an incentive-compatible debt management game, in which participants are saddled with multiple debts and need to decide how to repay them over time. Consistent with the hypothesis, four experiments reveal evidence of debt account aversion: Participants consistently pay off small debts first, even though the larger debts have higher interest rates.

Experimental evidence from U.S. consumers shows that consumers\u2019 propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U.K. credit card field data indicate that borrowers\u2019 credit limit and balance due also moderate these effects.

However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and affects behavior in coun-ternormative ways. They demonstrate the phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger preference to avoid tax-related costs than to avoid equal-sized (or larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases, financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who identify with \u201cantitax\u201d parties to consider positive uses of their tax payments mitigates tax aversion.

Such a network defines membership to the P2P group and allows for members to disseminate information within the group. The problem, named the membership overlay problem (MOP), can be formulated as a dynamic optimization problem where classical combinatorial optimization techniques must face the further challenge of time-varying input data. This paper proposes an innovative, fully distributed, and asynchronous subgradient optimization algorithm for the Lagrangean relaxation of the MOP, which can run online in fully decentralized P2P systems, and integrates it with a distributed heuristic that can achieve sound hot-start states for fast response to varying network structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0381","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in peer-to-peer computing and presents a mathematical optimization solution without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because the design of both of these layers is challenging by itself, researchers have mainly focused on solving these problems either independently or in a sequential fashion. In this paper, we look at the WDM optical network design problem with nonbifurcated traffic flows and propose an exact branch-and-price procedure that simultaneously solves logical topology design and traffic routing over the established logical topology. The unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that it works with a row-incomplete mathematical formulation and two types of variables that exponentially grow in number with the problem size. We discuss computational issues related to the use of this procedure and propose two approximate branch-and-price procedures that can be used to obtain lower and upper bounds for this problem.

However, the underlying justification for these algorithms is lacking, and their relative performances are typically domain and data dependent. In this paper, we aim to develop initial understanding of the recommendation model/algorithm validation and selection issues based on the graph topological modeling methodology. By representing the input data in the form of consumer\u2013product interactions as a bipartite graph, the consumer\u2013product graph, we develop bipartite graph topological measures to capture patterns that exist in the input data relevant to the transaction-based recommendation task. We observe the deviations of these topological measures of real-world consumer\u2013product graphs from the expected values for simulated random bipartite graphs. These deviations help explain why certain collaborative filtering algorithms work for particular recommendation data sets. They can also serve as the basis for a comprehensive model selection framework that \u201crecommends\u201d appropriate collaborative filtering algorithms given characteristics of the data set under study.

We propose a framework for decision support that consists of two phases. The first phase supports the manager in finding a good makespan for the turnaround. It computes an approximate project time-cost trade-off curve together with a stochastic evaluation. Our risk measures are the expected tardiness at time t and the probability of completing the turnaround within time t. In the second phase, we solve the actual scheduling optimization problem for the makespan chosen in the first phase heuristically and compute a detailed schedule that respects all side constraints. Again, we complement this by computing upper bounds for the same two risk measures. Our experimental results show that our methods solve large real-world instances from chemical manufacturing plants quickly and yield an excellent resource utilization. A comparison with solutions of a mixed-integer program on smaller instances proves the high quality of the schedules that our algorithms produce within a few minutes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0393","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and optimization in industrial maintenance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2011","23","2","Ciamac C.

We use this model to quantify the benefit of pooling ORs as a shared resource and to illustrate the impact of parallel surgery processing on surgery schedules. Decisions in our model include the number of ORs to open each day, the allocation of surgeries to ORs, the sequence of surgeries within each OR, and the start time for each surgeon. Realistic-sized instances of our model are difficult or impossible to solve with standard stochastic programming techniques. Therefore, we exploit several structural properties of the model to achieve computational advantages. Furthermore, we describe a novel set of widely applicable valid inequalities that make it possible to solve practical instances. Based on our results for different resource usage schemes, we conclude that the impact of parallel surgery processing and the benefit of OR pooling are significant.

Whereas many bidders rely on variants of the well-documented early or last-minute bidding strategies, neither strategy takes into account the aspect of auction competition: at any point in time, there are hundreds, even thousands, of the same or similar items up for sale, competing for the same bidder. In this paper, we propose a novel automated and data-driven bidding strategy. Our strategy consists of two main components. First, we develop a dynamic, forward-looking model for price in competing auctions. By incorporating dynamic features of the auction process and its competitive environment, our model is capable of accurately predicting an auction's price and outperforming model alternatives such as the generalized additive model, classification and regression trees, or Neural Networks. Then, using the idea of maximizing a bidder's surplus, we build a bidding framework around this model that selects the best auction to bid on and determines the best bid amount. The best auction is given by the one that yields the highest predicted surplus; the best bid amount is given by its predicted auction price. Our approach maximizes expected surplus and balances the probability of winning an auction with its average surplus. In simulations, we compare our automated strategy with early and last-minute bidding and find that our approach extracts 97% and 15% more expected surplus, respectively.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0397","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical and profit-driven approach to online auctions without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Besides characterizing optimal policies for the finite-horizon one-armed bandit problem, such an index provides a suboptimal heuristic index rule for the intractable finite-horizon multiarmed bandit problem, which represents the natural extension of the Gittins index rule (optimal in the infinite-horizon case). Although such a finite-horizon index was introduced in classic work in the 1950s, investigation of its efficient exact computation has received scant attention. This paper introduces a recursive adaptive-greedy algorithm using only arithmetic operations that computes the index in (pseudo-)polynomial time in the problem parameters (number of project states and time horizon length). In the special case of a project with limited transitions per state, the complexity is either reduced or depends only on the length of the time horizon.

General-purpose methods for performing that computation tend to be very expensive when the CTMC and the time interval are large. Based on a previously available method (regenerative transformation) for computing the interval availability complementary distribution, we develop a method called bounding regenerative transformation for the computation of bounds for that measure. Similar to regenerative transformation, bounding regenerative transformation requires the selection of a regenerative state. The method is targeted at a certain class of models, including both exact and bounding failure/repair models of fault-tolerant systems with increasing structure function, with exponential failure and repair time distributions and repair in every state with failed components having failure rates much smaller than repair rates (F/R models), with a \u201cnatural\u201d selection for the regenerative state. The method is numerically stable and computes the bounds with well-controlled error. For models in the targeted class and the natural selection for the regenerative state, computational cost should be traded off with bounds tightness through a control parameter. For large models in the class, the version of the method that should have the smallest computational cost should have small computational cost relative to the model size if the value above which the interval availability has to be guaranteed to be is close to 1. In addition, under additional conditions satisfied by F/R models, the bounds obtained with the natural selection for the regenerative state by the version that should have the smallest computational cost seem to be tight for all time intervals or not small time intervals, depending on whether the initial probability distribution of the CTMC is concentrated in the regenerative state or not.

The dimensions of these LPs are determined by the size of the data sets, and they keep their dimensions as each decision-making unit is scored. This approach can be computationally demanding, especially with large data sets. We present an algorithm for DEA based on a two-phase procedure. The first phase identifies the extreme efficient entities, the frame, of the production possibility set. The frame is then used in a second phase to score the rest of the entities. The new procedure applies to any of the four standard DEA returns to scale. It also imparts flexibility to a DEA study because it postpones the decision about orientation, benchmarking measurements, etc., until after the frame has been identified. Extensive computational testing on large data sets verifies and validates the procedure and demonstrates that it is computationally fast.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0400","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for data envelopment analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2011","23","2","Ali TafazzoliAli Tafazzolitafazzoli@metronaviation.comMetron Aviation, Inc., Dulles, Virginia 20166Search for more papers by this author, James R.

Context dependency refers to the fact that the statistical distribution of a new sample is heavily conditioned by a set of the most recent samples that precedes it. However, statistical models such as context trees (CTs) that capture context dependency tend to be poorly scalable. This paper proposes a solution to the scalability problem of these models by transforming a data stream into high-level aggregates of clusters instead of modeling the original data stream. Using an information-theoretical approach, we leverage existing clustering techniques for static categorical data sets to capture dynamic data streams based on the CT models. Because the proposed approach can be applied repeatedly on different levels of a clustering hierarchy, it is suitable for predicting trends and detecting anomalies at any aggregate (or detail) level required.

Because the exact calculation of the reliability of a network is NP-hard, network designers have been reluctant to use network reliability as a design criterion; however, it is clearly an important aspect. Herein, three methods of reliability assessment are developed: an exact reliability calculation method using factoring, an efficient Monte Carlo estimation procedure using the sequential construction technique and network reductions, and an upper bound for the all-terminal reliability of networks with arbitrary arc reliabilities. These three methods of reliability assessment are used collectively in a biobjective GA with specialized mutation operators that perturb solutions without disturbing two-node connectivity.

Although not yet investigated by the OR scientific community, except for some preliminary theoretical results concerning the special case of acyclic networks, balanced path problems arise in several interesting applications, such as in transportation and in telecommunication settings. In this work, the focus is on the computation of node-disjoint balanced paths in the general case, where the input graph G could have any structure. Starting from some algorithmic ideas proposed for acyclic networks, a general framework based on the color-coding method for computing simple paths is first described. Then the general framework is specialized, and a pool of algorithms is designed that includes both an exact approach as well as alternative heuristics. The algorithms have been tested on a large suite of instances generated from some benchmark telecommunication instances. An additional set of instances, generated from some benchmark crew scheduling instances, has been used to get an idea of the behavior of the algorithms in the context of transportation applications. The obtained computational results are very interesting. For the telecommunication instances, in some cases the exact algorithm produced the optimal solution very rapidly; in the remaining cases, some of the proposed heuristics were able to generate high-quality solutions in a very quick time. As for the crew scheduling instances, which are larger and sometimes appear more difficult than the telecommunication ones, a suitable combination of the proposed color-coding issues allowed us to compute the optimal solutions in very short times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0410","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical computational issues related to algorithms without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

First, we introduce the new concept of adding dummy points to the inner approximation of a Pareto set. By using these dummy points, we can determine accurate inner and outer approximations more efficiently, i.e., using less time-consuming optimizations. Second, we introduce a new method for the calculation of an error measure that is easy to interpret. Third, we show how transforming certain objective functions can improve the results of sandwich algorithms and extend their applicability to certain nonconvex problems. To show the effect of these enhancements, we make a numerical comparison using four test cases, including a four-dimensional case from the field of intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The results of the different cases show that we can achieve an accurate approximation using significantly fewer optimizations by using the enhancements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0419","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical advancements in optimization algorithms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The proposed approach includes many realistic features of typical supply chain systems such as production planning and scheduling, inventory management, transportation delay, transportation cost, and transportation limits.

Effects of the elasticity in price demand in production and inventory decisions are also examined. The supply chain model is formulated as a convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Reformulations are presented to make the problem tractable.

In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m - p + 1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program.

In this paper, a new effective evolutionary algorithm is proposed for this class of nonlinear bilevel programming problems. First, based on the leader's objective function, a new fitness function is proposed that can be easily used to evaluate the quality of different types of potential solutions. Then, based on Latin squares, an efficient crossover operator is constructed that has the ability of local search. Furthermore, a new mutation operator is designed by using some good search directions so that the offspring can approach a global optimal solution quickly. To solve the follower's problem efficiently, we apply some efficient deterministic optimization algorithms in the MATLAB Toolbox to search for its solutions. The asymptotically global convergence of the algorithm is proved. Numerical experiments on 25 test problems show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance than the compared algorithms on most of the test problems and is effective and efficient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0430","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of algorithm development and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop a customized clock auction that is able to allocate grid resources and discover separate prices for the different computing resources under the condition that buyers do not know with certainty how much of these resources they will need. The proposed clock auction facilitates the discovery of unit prices for the resources in each time period in a finite-horizon market. Our mechanism exploits the lopsided nature of the grid market where a small number of large-scale jobs are expected to be completed by a large number of heterogeneous, distributed machines. The traditional stopping rule used for clock auctions is not effective in our setting, and therefore we design several adaptations that can be implemented in real time, geared toward ending the auction process quickly while producing a close-to-efficient allocation. Our extensive computations show that our clock-and-offer auction outperforms the traditional clock auction in terms of computational tractability, social welfare, and expected bidder's utility. For large problems of practical interest, we develop a transportation-based heuristic for the NP-complete bid feasibility problem and demonstrate theoretically and computationally that it quickly produces high-quality solutions to the overall problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0431","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of grid computing and auction mechanisms without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

Despite its growing popularity, few studies have offered a coherent theoretical basis for the standard's appeal. A theory-based explanation enhances understanding and appreciation for the standard, and provides clarity on how the standard benefits organizations. In this paper, we invoke the resource dependence theory (RDT) to purport that the standard is used by organizations as a tool to manage their organizational environment. It does this by specifying procedures that organizations need to manage their organization\u2013environment boundary spanning processes. Using the RDT perspective, a model with three key constructs embodying ISO 9000 was developed: internal processes, relationships with customers and relationships with suppliers. The latter two were treated as being part of the task environment. We predicted that the external aspects of the standard affect operating performance (a measure of effectiveness), both directly and through internal processes. Empirical data from 416 ISO 9000 registered Australian manufacturing plants validated the RDT perspective, and suggest that the three constructs, individually and in isolation, are not as effective as when they are considered together. By invoking RDT, a new theoretical viewpoint to ISO 9000 has been developed that adds to other theoretical perspectives, and goes some way to explaining the growing popularity of this standard with organizations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.04.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the theoretical and operational aspects of ISO 9000 without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

SCI consists of internal integration of different functions within a company and external integration with trading partners. While both supply chain internal and external integration have been studied extensively, our understanding of what influences SCI and the relationship between internal and external integration is still very limited. This paper argues that external integration with customers and suppliers is simultaneously influenced by internal integration and relationship commitment to customers and suppliers. Internal integration enables external integration because organizations must first develop internal integration capabilities through system-, data-, and process-integration, before they can engage in meaningful external integration. At the same time, before external integration can be successfully implemented, organizations must have a willingness to integrate with external supply chain partners, which is demonstrated by their relationship commitment.\n            \n            We propose and test a model that specifies the relationship between internal integration, relationship commitment, and external integration, using data collected from manufacturing firms in China. The results show that internal integration and relationship commitment improve external integration independently, and their interactive effect on external integration is not significant. However, internal integration has a much greater impact on external integration than relationship commitment.\n            \n            We also examine the model for companies with different ownerships, and the results indicate that for Chinese controlled companies where there is a strong collectivism culture and more reliance on \u201cGuanxi\u201d (relationship), relationship commitment has a significant impact on external integration with suppliers and customers. This is in stark contrast to foreign controlled companies, characterized by a more individualistic culture and more reliance on technological capabilities, where no significant relationship between relationship commitment and external integration could be found. The model is also tested across different industries and different regions in China, providing useful insights for Chinese companies in particular. This study makes significant contributions to the SCI literature by simultaneously studying the effects of internal integration and relationship commitment on external integration, and providing several future research directions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.04.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['relationship commitment', 'integration', 'supply chain']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain integration and relationship dynamics without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

A strong inference research setting is used to test the contingency hypothesis against a conventional hypothesis that expects the most sophisticated planning techniques to always be most effective. Multisource data from the machinery manufacturing industry support the contingency hypothesis and reject the universalistic hypothesis.

It is thus important for the new venture to attract funding from external investors such as suppliers. Although the operations management (OM) literature addresses product development and supplier involvement in large firms, few studies have examined the relationship between suppliers and new ventures. This study examines how new ventures can complement their resources and experience with supplier investment, to build positional advantages for their first product and increase marketplace performance. We integrate the OM and entrepreneurship literatures to develop a model based on the resource-based view of the firm, in which the new venture uses external and internal resources to achieve positional advantages of product innovativeness, supplier involvement in production, and product launch quality. We also investigate how market potential moderates the relationship between positional advantages and performance. We empirically test our model using data from 711 new ventures.\n            \n            We find that it is beneficial for a new venture to involve suppliers in production of the first product, and that market potential positively moderates the relationship of product launch quality and performance. However, the results reported here also reveal several surprising results challenging traditional views. Developing a highly innovative first product is much less, not more, important than achieving a high quality first-product launch. Increasing product innovativeness does not necessarily lead to high product performance for new ventures. For a small market with low growth potential, product innovativeness has a negative, not positive, effect on first product performance. We discuss managerial implications of our findings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier investment', 'product launch', 'market potential']","The article primarily focuses on operational strategies for new ventures and supplier involvement, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, the association between manufacturing capabilities and firm performance has seldom been studied in the context of high technology new ventures. Using a sample of 167 UK-based, high technology manufacturing ventures, the current study examines the relationship between manufacturing capabilities (in particular, those contributing to low operating costs and product quality) and venture performance. Additionally, the moderating effects of the ventures\u2019 alliance portfolios and environmental contexts on the capability\u2013performance relationships are explored. Results indicate that venture performance (as reflected in sales growth, return on sales (ROS), and return on assets (ROA)) is significantly predicted by manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs and product quality. Further, the data generally support the hypothesized moderating effects of two alliance diversity variables (alliance partner diversity and alliance geographic diversity) and two environmental context variables (environmental dynamism and environmental munificence) on the capability\u2013performance relationships. Overall, the study supports the premise that the value of manufacturing capabilities (i.e., the strength of the capability\u2013performance relationship) among high technology ventures is contingent upon the alliance and environmental contexts within which those ventures operate. Specifically, alliance partner diversity, alliance geographic diversity, and environmental munificence enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs. Alliance partner diversity, environmental munificence, and environmental stability enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote product quality. The study's theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.004","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['diversity', 'environmental context', 'capabilities']","The article discusses 'alliance diversity' and its moderating effects on performance, indicating a recognition of diverse partnerships as beneficial.

Likewise, growing evidence suggests that effective operations control is a common quality of successful firms. On the surface the two phenomena\u2014corporate entrepreneurship and operations control\u2014may seem to be inherently at odds. That is, corporate entrepreneurship is aimed at taking the firm in new directions, while operations control is aimed at channeling and often restricting actions. As such, it would be useful to know how operations control variables act in concert with the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial activity to promote the innovation outcomes that facilitate long-term organizational success. In this study of 177 firms operating in a wide variety of industries, we investigate the effect on innovation performance of several commonly-acknowledged antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2008, 2002); namely, management support, work discretion/autonomy, rewards/reinforcements, time availability, and organizational boundaries. More importantly, we examine the moderating effects of operations control variables \u2013 specifically risk control and process control formality \u2013 on the relationships between the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance. Results indicate that only two of the five antecedents to corporate entrepreneurship have main effects on innovation performance with moderate significance. However, each of the five antecedents significantly interacts with one or both of the operations control variables and, thereby, influences innovation performance. The implications of these results in relation to operations management and corporate entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.005","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['entrepreneurship', 'innovation', 'operations control']","The article discusses corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

This conceptual model is tested with 225 dyad samples from manufacturer\u2013distributor supply chains in China. The results show that cooperation and the type of conflict have both individual and interactive effects on the manufacturer's knowledge acquisition, thus highlighting the importance of the co-opetition perspective on supply chain knowledge management. More importantly, the results show that the entrepreneurial orientation of a distributor positively moderates the relationships between co-opetition factors and a manufacturer's knowledge acquisition, implying that strengthening the distributor's entrepreneurial orientation can improve the efficiency of co-opetition and thereby affect the knowledge acquisition of the manufacturer, and highlighting the importance of blended analysis across the domains of supply chain management and entrepreneurship.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.006","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['co-opetition', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'knowledge acquisition']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and entrepreneurial orientation without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, uncertain and dynamic task environments of emerging firms require more flexible organizational structures. Such duality of structural prescriptions stems from competing demands of task and institutional environments. We propose that manufacturing flexibility could help decouple activities required in task environments from those required in institutional environments, thereby mitigating the conflict of adopting flexible and rigid structures at the same time. An emerging venture could meet demands of institutional environments through formalized structures, and use manufacturing flexibility to address needs of task environment in order to mitigate liabilities of newness. Using a sample of 167 high-technology manufacturing firms in the UK, we use a moderated polynomial regression approach to test the proposed framework. Results indicate that formalized structures in conjunction with manufacturing flexibility lead to enhanced performance. The findings extend literature on organizational structures in operations management and entrepreneurship.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['flexibility', 'formalization', 'environmental uncertainty']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and performance metrics rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

According to this explanation, raw materials inventories are larger the higher a company's transaction costs and the lower its storage-related production and management costs. Factors that affect these costs are the company's vulnerability to opportunism, whether the input becomes more or less costly to store and manage as it moves through the supply chain, payment terms and the company's power in relation to its supplier. This explanation for the level of raw materials inventories was tested on a large sample of customer industries matched to their main supplier industries. Consistent with this theory, the empirical results show that companies hold larger raw materials inventories the more money their suppliers spend on research and development and the less important the customers are to their suppliers. These results are important because they indicate companies must consider a wider range of factors than previously thought necessary when establishing inventory policy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.11.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on transaction cost economics and supply chain power dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Reliable and valid instruments of these constructs were developed through rigorous empirical analysis. Data were collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing firms in various industries. The statistical methods used include confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (i.e., LISREL). The results indicate that supply chain collaboration improves collaborative advantage and indeed has a bottom-line influence on firm performance, and collaborative advantage is an intermediate variable that enables supply chain partners to achieve synergies and create superior performance.

Studies examining the link between performance management and performance improvement implicitly assume that performance management affects behavior of individuals in an organization, which then facilitates the achievement of organizational goals. This study takes a step towards understanding this implicit assumption. We investigate how performance management practices relate to improvement in performance by influencing behavior of individuals. We focus on operational performance management, i.e. the definition and use of performance measures on the shopfloor in production and distribution. We use a survey among 102 companies to identify the relations between performance management practices, shopfloor behavior and improvement in performance. We identified three independent clusters of operator behavior that positively correlate with performance improvement: \u201cUnderstanding\u201d, \u201cMotivation\u201d and \u201cFocus on Improvement\u201d. We show that 17 out of the 20 performance management practices found in literature have a significant and positive relation with one or more clusters of operator behavior. We furthermore found that there is a positive correlation between the number of performance management practices applied and performance improvement, suggesting that it is not only which practices are applied but also how many. Recommendations emerging from this study enable managers to identify which behavioral changes are desired to improve performance and to select those performance management practices that positively influence the desired behavior.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.12.009","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['performance management', 'behavior', 'improvement']","The article focuses primarily on performance management practices and their impact on operational performance, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

How can companies improve the social and environmental performance within their supply chains, particularly as other competitive pressures, such as cost and quality, continue to escalate? Starting from an efficient versus responsive supply chain framework, we develop an integrative model that blends together elements of supply chain configuration, stakeholder management, and capability development. Specifically, we spotlight the dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and performance. In particular, this analysis reveals that the nature of stakeholder exposure determines how social/environmental technical and relational capabilities impact social and environmental outcomes. We conclude with implications for research and practice, discussing how current supply chain theories must be extended to incorporate external stakeholders, to clarify strategies and identify potential pitfalls, and to better predict performance outcomes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.01.001","","JOM","Operations Management","7","['accountability', 'social outcomes', 'environmental performance', 'stakeholder management']","The article emphasizes accountability for social and environmental outcomes in supply chains, highlighting the importance of stakeholder management and the impact of social/environmental capabilities.

While one view relates efficiency with good operations management and asserts that slack resources are a form of waste that should be minimized, the other view suggests that limited resource slack can impose heavy costs on firms by making them brittle. In this research, the authors build on these views to investigate the relationship of inventory, production, and marketing resource efficiency of firms with three metrics of financial performance (i.e., Stock-Returns, Tobin's Q, and Returns-on-Assets). The authors evaluate the theoretical framework using secondary information on all U.S. based publicly-owned manufacturing firms across the 16-year time period of 1991\u20132006. Analysis utilizing a mixed-model approach reveals that a focus on resource efficiency is positively associated with firm financial performance. However, findings also support the arguments favoring slack, indicating that the financial gains from resource efficiency exhibit diminishing returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.01.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on financial performance metrics and operational efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This study reexamines this relationship in an attempt to overcome some shortcomings of previous research. To that end, a theory-based measure of inventory leanness, which takes into account industry-specific inventory management characteristics, is proposed. The analysis of a large panel data set of U.S. manufacturing companies reveals that the significance and shape of the inventory\u2013performance relationship varies substantially across industries. This relationship is significant in two-thirds of the 54 industries studied. In most of these instances, the relationship is concave, suggesting that there is an optimum level of inventory leanness beyond which firm performance deteriorates.

The qualitative case studies chosen were published between 1992 and 2007. With an increasing trend toward using more qualitative case studies, there have been meaningful and significant contributions to the field of operations management, especially in the area of theory building. However, in many of the qualitative case studies we reviewed, sufficient details in research design, data collection, and data analysis were missing. For instance, there are studies that do not offer sampling logic or a description of the analysis through which research out-comes are drawn. Further, research protocols for doing inductive case studies are much better developed compared to the research protocols for doing deductive case studies. Consequently, there is a lack of consistency in the way the case method has been applied.

We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.07.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Internet retailing and product returns without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This development is often associated with a firm's tendency to change from a make to a buy strategy. However, a few studies investigate the change of product architecture in the reverse direction \u2013 from modular to integral form \u2013 and the subsequent change in the firm sourcing decision from a buy to a make strategy. These studies hold to the presumption that a firm following a make strategy will outperform firms following a buy strategy in dealing with integral product architectures. Based on the knowledge-based view, we argue for the viability of a sourcing strategy between the pure make and buy strategies \u2013 a pseudo-make strategy. We also argue that as product architecture changes from a modular to integral form, firms adopting this pseudo-make strategy are likely to show better product performance than firms following a pure make or buy strategy due to the relative knowledge advantages of the pseudo-make strategy in dealing with the integral product architecture. We examine the impact of the make/pseudo-make/buy strategies on product performance in the U.S. bicycle derailleur and freewheel market from 1980 to 1992 and provide theoretical and managerial implications of our results. Our findings highlight an important distinction between the pseudo-make and make-buy strategies that has not previously been fully appreciated in the extant literature, and as a result increases our understanding of why some firms do not switch strategies from a buy to a make strategy when product architecture changes from modular to integral form as previously expected.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.08.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sourcing strategies and product performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The remote warehouses serve customers in their respective regions. Common assumptions in the academic literature include use of the Poisson demand process and instantaneous unit-by-unit replenishment. In the practitioner literature, single-echelon approximations are advised for setting safety stock to deal with lead time, demand, and supply variations in these settings. Using data from a U.S. supplier of home improvement products, we find that neither the assumptions from the academic literature nor the approximations from the practitioner literature necessarily work well in practice.\n            \n            In a variation of the strictly arborescent supply chain, the central warehouse at our real company not only replenishes other warehouses but also meets demand from customers in the region near the central warehouse. In this paper, we study this dual-role central warehouse structure, which we believe is common in practice. Using high and low volume product demand data from this company, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the impact of (1) the use of a dual-role centralized warehouse, (2) common demand assumptions made in multi-echelon research, and (3) single-echelon approximations for managing a multi-echelon supply chain. We explore each of these under both centralized and decentralized control logic. We find that the common assumptions of theoretical models impede their usefulness and that heuristics that ignore the actual supply chain structure fail to account for additional opportunities to utilize safety stock more effectively. Researchers should be aware of the gap between standard assumptions in traditional literature and actual practice, and critically evaluate their assumptions to find a reasonable balance between tractability and relevance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.11.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory modeling and supply chain management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We draw on and synthesize the theoretical perspectives of Website Usability, Technology Acceptance Model, and Transaction Costs, to triangulate and deduce hypotheses linking customization of the online purchase process in electronic retailing and customer satisfaction.

The research method used for the empirical analysis is Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). The results indicate that decision customization that provides choice assistance by way of personalized product recommendations is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the decision-making sub-process; and transaction customization, oriented towards making the transaction sub-process personal, convenient, and interactive is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the purchase transaction sub-process.

Given that the priority of R&D projects and the interdependencies between the projects in a high tech firm change dynamically, high tech R&D project management is a complex and challenging endeavor. To improve the understanding and management of high tech R&D projects, this paper reports the findings of a field study where we, first, develop and empirically estimate a model that relates project priority over time with the generative mechanisms of market pull and technical challenge associated with R&D projects. Next, we develop and demonstrate the application of a process model within which the time-varying project priority model is embedded. The process model makes it possible to allocate fixed resources among competing projects with time-varying interdependencies, thereby improving the timeliness of project completion. This research was conducted in collaboration with a major U.S. high tech firm. The corporate R&D center of the firm served as the research setting for the field study. We present an application of the process model to delineate the evolution of the R&D organization with the merger of its (technology driven) parent firm with another (market driven) high tech manufacturing firm. The application of the process model generates theoretical insights that are used to develop testable propositions.

We report findings from a detailed case analysis of a supply chain planning process that seemingly weathers these cross-functional conflicts. In contrast to traditional research on this area, which focuses on incentives, responsibilities, and structures, we adopt a process perspective and find that integration was achieved despite formal functional incentives that did not support it. By drawing a distinction between the incentive landscape and the planning process, we identify process as a mediator that can affect organizational outcomes. Thus, organizations may be capable of integration while functions retain different incentives and orientations to maintain focus on their stakeholders\u2019 needs. Through iterative coding, we identify the attributes of the planning process that can drive planning performance\u2014information, procedural, and alignment quality\u2014but also find evidence that achieving alignment in the execution of plans can be more important than informational and procedural quality.

Academic knowledge about fleet management in humanitarian operations is scarce. Using a multiple case research design we study Field Vehicle Fleet Management (Field VFM) in four large International Humanitarian Organizations (IHO): the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the World Food Program and World Vision International. Our field research includes more than 40 interviews at headquarters, regional and national level in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The paper answers three research questions: (1) How do IHO manage their field vehicle fleets? (2) What are the critical factors affecting IHO Field VFM? (3) How does Field VFM affect in-country program delivery? The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it helps to fill the existing gap in the humanitarian literature regarding Field VFM. Second, it expands the fleet management literature to a new and virtually unexplored area.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.11.013","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'operations', 'program delivery']","The article discusses fleet management in humanitarian organizations, which implies a focus on social impact and operational ethics.

Analysis of 1726 intake appointments for the year preceding and the full year following the lean project showed a 27% increase in service capacity to intake new patients and a 12% reduction in the no-show rate as a result of the transformation of service processes achieved by the lean project. This study's action research methodology leverages the researcher's involvement in redesigning a service system that greatly improved performance and led to reflection on traditional operations management (OM) approaches to appointment scheduling. The study generates insights about effective alignment of resources, develops new strategies for service operations to respond to no-shows, reveals time-related variables that have been overlooked in appointment scheduling research, and challenges traditional OM scheduling performance measures. We provide recommendations for effective and appropriate use of overbooking and identify avenues for future research to continuously improve and increase the capacity of service operations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.12.005","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['capacity', 'service operations', 'healthcare', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and performance metrics in healthcare without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, a methodological review of OSCM empirical research in 2002\u20132007 is provided to highlight that OSCM empirical studies, unlike those in other business disciplines, have rarely used content analysis as a methodological tool. This paper then reviews the methodological strengths of content analysis, which lie primarily in its malleability, economy of data collection, repeatability, and unobtrusiveness. These strengths not only make content analysis a viable empirical method but also position it as a method that can be used in concert with other empirical methods in OSCM research, such as survey, case study, and secondary research methodologies. This paper also proposes a generic framework for a content analytic approach to measuring theoretical constructs, illustrates the application of the framework to a construct in the OSCM literature (buyer\u2013supplier relationalism), and reports the satisfactory results of reliability and validity tests for the content analysis-based measure of buyer\u2013supplier relationalism. In addition, this paper proposes and demonstrates that the use of convergence study in tandem with content analysis can substantially reduce the content analysis efforts needed in measuring the construct of interest, thus improving the overall efficiency of the process of content analysis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.08.001","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on methodological approaches in operations and supply chain management without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Based on the social capital argument, SCM scholars have investigated how a buyer can gain access to and leverage resources through its collaborative BSRs. Our study extends this research stream by considering the \u201cdark side\u201d of social capital in BSRs. It evaluates how social capital in its cognitive, relational, and structural forms contributes to or impedes value creation within BSRs. Both primary survey measures and secondary objective measures have been used in data analysis. The results show the presence of both the bright side, confirming the existing literature, and the dark side, extending the literature. There is an inverted curvilinear relationship between social capital and performance: Either too little or too much social capital can hurt performance. This study confirms that building social capital in a collaborative BSR positively affects buyer performance, but that if taken to an extreme it can reduce the buyer's ability to be objective and make effective decisions as well as increase the supplier's opportunistic behavior. Our study also examines how a buyer can delay the emergence of the dark side. It opens up new research avenues in the collaborative BSR context and suggests directions for future research and practice.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2010.09.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['social capital', 'collaborative', 'value creation']","The article discusses the concept of social capital in buyer-supplier relationships, which touches on ethical considerations and the dynamics of collaboration.

In this study, we use theory-building through case studies to answer the question: how do organizations balance short-term profitability and long-term environmental sustainability when making supply chain decisions under conditions of uncertainty? We present five sets of propositions that explain how exemplars in green supply chain management make decisions and balance short and long term objectives.

Anecdotal evidence from the Japanese and U.S. automotive industry and emerging research suggests that inter-organizational identification of suppliers with their buyers, termed supplier-to-buyer identification, is an unexplored factor of relational advantage. This study presents a model and empirical test that supplier-to-buyer identification fosters superior operational performance by enhancing trust, supplier relation-specific investments, and information exchange. Through a survey of 346 automotive supplier\u2013buyer relationships, the findings show that supplier-to-buyer identification directly impacts supplier relationship-specific investments and information exchange, although most of the latter effect is mediated by trust. The findings also indicate that supplier relation-specific investments and information exchange play different but complementary roles in influencing operational performance.

Based on the contingency and organizational information processing theories, we argue that under a high EU, the associations between supplier/customer integration, and delivery and flexibility performance, and those between internal integration, and product quality and production cost, will be strengthened. These theoretical propositions are largely confirmed by multi-group and structural path analyses of survey responses collected from 151 of Thailand's automotive manufacturing plants.

Building from two theoretical foundations, the knowledge-based and relational views of the firm, we examine the effects of absorptive capacity and collaborative process competence on the outcomes of an episodic collaboration initiative. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically validate the positive effect of absorptive capacity, collaborative process competence and level of engagement on the operational and relational success of a collaboration effort. Results show that collaborative process competence mediates the relationship between absorptive capacity and collaborative engagement, and positively influences both operational and relational outcomes.

However, there is scarce empirical work examining its effects in this setting. Focus in hospitals can take several different forms, ranging from standalone specialty centers to a hospital that chooses to emphasize in some operational way a particular specialty while still offering a full range of services. Although standalone facilities can be found in many locations, the vast majority of hospitals must follow the latter route to achieve focus. Current conceptualizations and measures of focus struggle to capture this construct in a way that does not assume a narrowing of range of offerings. In contrast to the traditional view of focus as narrowing, in this paper, we address the perspective of focus as emphasis. We select cardiology as the specialty and use secondary data for more than 264,000 patients in New York State to examine the relationship between focus as emphasis and hospital cost performance. Our results support the notion that such focus is associated with lower costs. Moreover, our results also show that focus in hospitals can be operationalized as a disproportionate emphasis on one line of service, without necessarily narrowing the overall range of services provided.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.02.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiency and cost performance in hospitals without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A complements/substitutes perspective","Doctors\u2019 orders entered with Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems are designed to enhance patient care by standardizing routines that are intended to improve quality of healthcare. As with other health information technology (IT) performance studies, literature shows conflicting results regarding the CPOE\u2013performance relationship. By adopting a more nuanced perspective and employing not just adoption but extent of use of CPOE, we first examine whether or not CPOE use improves patient satisfaction. Next, given that CPOEs are implemented in the backdrop of other hospital IT infrastructure, we examine how IT infrastructure impacts the relationship between CPOE use and satisfaction, testing both a complementary and substitution perspective. Finally, we examine the differential impact of CPOE use between academic and non-academic hospitals. Using data from 806 hospitals nationwide, we find a positive relationship between extent of CPOE use and patient satisfaction. Contrary to extant research, our results suggest this relationship is stronger in non-academic hospitals. We also find evidence that a hospital's IT infrastructure substitutes for CPOE use in its effect on patient satisfaction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['patient satisfaction', 'healthcare', 'CPOE', 'IT infrastructure']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of healthcare IT systems and their impact on patient satisfaction, without a significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

However, research into diversification, product platforms, and other issues related to product portfolio complexity has often produced inconsistent guidance. This situation is at least partially attributable to an incomplete definition of portfolio complexity, and to corresponding limitations of theories applied to date. To address these limitations, we define product portfolio complexity as a design state manifested by the multiplicity, diversity, and interrelatedness of products within the portfolio. We conceptually establish the three-dimensional nature of complexity and present a model to provide insights into how each dimension impacts operational performance. As an extension to prior theoretical perspectives, the model explicitly addresses the roles of organizational learning and the character of fixed assets (utilization and flexibility) as mediator and moderator of product portfolio architectural complexity's effects, respectively. We also incorporate the principle of diminishing returns to address potential non-linearities in the proposed relationships. Prior theories and research studies have neglected these issues. We conclude by discussing useful perspectives with which to view the model, and by presenting measures of portfolio complexity and approaches for testing the propositions developed herein.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.03.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product portfolio complexity and operational performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Social dilemmas are often observed in operational processes involving teamwork, such as developing new products or implementing total quality programs. The extent to which an employee cooperates with others is driven not only by material incentives but also by social preferences: individuals have an interest in the welfare of others as well as their own. Two known social preferences are status and relationship maintenance. Multiple studies have shown that status seeking leads team members to compete more whereas relationship building leads them to cooperate more. The question remains of whether these two preferences can coexist and complement one another (as when status seeking triggers effort and relationship building encourages cooperation) or whether they are at odds. In this experimental study we demonstrate that these two social preferences hinder one another: status reduces the collaboration benefit from relationships, and increases only individual, but not collaborative, effort. These results suggest that managerial interventions that promote status seeking and relationship building behavior cannot easily be used simultaneously when motivating teams to perform in situations involving social dilemmas.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.03.004","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['social dilemma', 'cooperation', 'relationship building']","The article discusses social dilemmas and the balance between individual interests and collective welfare, indicating some awareness of ethical considerations in teamwork.

The study thus demonstrates that online retailers need to deliver on order fulfillment promises, since a failure to live up to these promises can be detrimental.

If so, what factors influence the quality risk? Progress addressing these deceptively simple questions has been hindered by the challenges associated with (1) difficulties in controlling for a wide range of factors that may potentially affect quality risk in offshore manufacturing and (2) the lack of available measures that are consistent across geographic regions. This paper contributes to the academic discourse by empirically assessing differences in quality risk across domestic and offshore plants in a setting that naturally controls for many confounding factors. Specifically, we employ a sample of 30 pairs of regulated drug manufacturing plants in the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico matched both by parent firm and by product standard industrial code (SIC). Using a plant-level measure of quality risk that is measurement invariant, our findings indicate that Puerto Rican plants operate with a significantly higher quality risk than matching plants operated by the same firm located in the mainland U.S., on average. This finding persists above and beyond potentially important factors, such as geographic distance and the local population's general and industry-specific skills. Thus, challenges related to the transfer and maintenance of the knowledge required to operate with a low quality risk across non-geographic distance are left as the most plausible explanatory factors. Practically, our research highlights the need for manufacturing firms to carefully consider increased quality risk associated with the offshoring of production, particularly with regard to process-sensitive products like drugs. From a policy standpoint, our study highlights the need for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continue to intensify its inspection focus on international manufacturing.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.06.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['quality risk', 'offshore manufacturing', 'FDA']","The article focuses primarily on quality risk in offshore manufacturing without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Specifically, we study what factors influence the number of accidents that have occurred in the past three and a half years in 78 Dutch warehouses. Based on prior research in (behavioral) operations management, safety management, and organizational behavior, we identify hazard reducing systems (HRS), safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), and safety consciousness (SC) as potential predictors of safety performance. Path analysis on data from a survey among 78 warehouse managers and 1033 warehouse employees shows, in line with prior research, that HRS is a strong predictor of safety performance. Importantly, our results also suggest that SSTL may be an even more important predictor of safety performance than HRS. SSTL affects safety performance directly (contrary to our expectations SC does not mediate this relationship) and strongly predicts safety performance even after controlling for the effects of HRS. SSTL also mediates some of the effects of HRS on safety performance. Subsequently, we propose that leaders are critical in fostering safety on the work floor.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2011.06.005","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['safety', 'leadership', 'performance']","The article focuses on safety performance and leadership in warehouse settings, which touches on ethical organizational practices but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

Product recalls due to safety hazards entail societal costs, such as property damage, injury, and sometimes death. For firms, the related external failure costs are many, including the costs of recalling the product, providing a remedy, meeting the legal liability, and repairing damage to the firm's reputation. The recent spate of product recalls has shifted attention from why products are recalled to why it takes so long to recall a defective product that poses a safety hazard. To address this, our research subjects to empirical scrutiny the time to recall and its relationship with recall strategies, source of the defect and supply chain position of the recalling firm. We develop and verify our conceptual arguments in the U.S. toy industry by analyzing over 500 product recalls during a 15-year period (1993\u20132008). The empirical results indicate that the time to recall, as measured by difference between product recall announcement date and product first sold date, is associated with (1) the recall strategy (preventive vs. reactive) adopted by the firm, (2) the type of product defect (manufacturing defect vs. design flaw), and (3) the supply chain entity that issues the recall (toy company vs. distributor vs. retailer).

We argue that these three capabilities mediate the relationship between information management capability and firm performance. We use a rare archival data set from a conglomerate business group that had adopted a model of performance excellence for organizational transformation based on the Baldrige criteria.  This data set contains actual scores from high quality assessments of firms and intraorganizational units of the conglomerate, and hence provides unobtrusive measures of the key constructs to validate our conceptual model.\n\nWe find that information management capability plays an important role in developing other firm capabilities for customer management, process management, and performance management.  In turn, these capabilities favorably influence customer, financial, human resources, and organizational effectiveness measures of firm performance.  Among key managerial implications, senior leaders must focus on creating necessary conditions for developing IT infrastructure and information management capability because they play a foundational role in building other capabilities for improved firm performance.

An Examination of Dynamic Pricing in Name-Your-Own Price Markets","The enhanced abilities of online retailers to learn about their customers\u2019 shopping behaviors have increased fears of dynamic pricing, a practice in which a seller sets prices based on the estimated buyer\u2019s willingness-to-pay.  However, among online retailers, a deviation from a one-price-for-all policy is the exception.  When price discrimination is observed, it is often in the context of customer outrage about unfair pricing.\n\nOne setting where pricing varies is the name-your-own-price (NYOP) mechanism.  In contrast to a typical retail setting, in NYOP markets, it is the buyer who places an initial offer.  This offer is accepted if it is above some threshold price set by the seller.  If the initial offer is rejected, the buyer can update her offer in subsequent rounds.  By design, the final purchase price is opaque to the public; the price paid depends on the individual buyer\u2019s willingness-to-pay and offer strategy.  Further, most forms of NYOP employ a fixed threshold price policy.\n\nIn this paper, we compare a fixed threshold price setting with an adaptive threshold price setting.  A seller who considers an adaptive threshold price has to weigh potentially greater profits against customer objections about the perceived fairness of such a policy.  We first derive the optimal strategy for the seller.  We analyze the effectiveness of an adaptive threshold price vis-\u00e0-vis a fixed threshold price on seller profit and customer satisfaction.  Further, we evaluate the moderating effect of revealing the threshold price policy (adaptive versus fixed) to buyers.  We test our model in a series of laboratory experiments and in a large field experiment at a prominent NYOP seller involving real purchases. Our results show that revealing the usage of an adaptive mechanism yields higher profits and more transactions than not revealing this information.  In the field experiment, we find that applying a revealed adaptive threshold price can increase profits by over 20 percent without lowering customer satisfaction.","https://misq.umn.edu/price-discrimination-in-e-commerce-an-examination-of-dynamic-pricing-in-name-your-own-price-markets.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['fairness', 'customer objections', 'pricing']","The article discusses customer objections related to perceived fairness in pricing strategies, which indicates a moderate awareness of ethical considerations in business practices.

Despite the apparent advantages that make the middle so populous or \u201cswollen\u201d (Hennart 1993, p. 472), Kambil et al.

(2) How do e-marketplaces, specifically all-in-one markets, help resolve this conflict?  Our research highlights that brokers, trading partners, and agents who operate in the middle (where the contradictory logic of markets and hierarchies are mixed) experience goal, behavior, and identity conflict.

When those employees find that they are unable to achieve their goals in the current environment, how do they decide whether they should change the composition of their routines or the materiality of the technologies with which they work?  The perspective advanced in this paper suggests that the answer to this question depends on how human and material agencies\u2014the basic building blocks common to both routines and technologies\u2014are imbricated.  Imbrication of human and material agencies creates infrastructure in the form of routines and technologies that people use to carry out their work.  Routine or technological infrastructure used at any given moment is the result of previous imbrications of human and material agencies.  People draw on this infrastructure to construct a perception that a technology either constrains their ability to achieve their goals, or that the technology affords the possibility of achieving new goals.  The case of a computer simulation technology for automotive design used to illustrate this framework suggests that perceptions of constraint lead people to change their technologies while perceptions of affordance lead people to change their routines.  This imbrication metaphor is used to suggest how a human agency approach to technology can usefully incorporate notions of material agency into its explanations of organizational change.","https://misq.umn.edu/when-flexible-routines-meet-flexible-technologies-affordance-constraint-and-the-imbrication-of-human-and-material-agencies.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['human agency', 'material agency', 'infrastructure']","The article discusses the interplay between human and material agencies, suggesting a nuanced understanding of organizational change.

This paper seeks to build a theoretical framework drawing on the concepts and the analytical tool of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory.  The paper presents a CAS model of IT use that encodes a bottom-up IT use process into three interrelated elements:  agents that consist of the basic entities of actions in an IT use process, interactions that refer to the mutually adaptive behaviors of agents, and an environment that represents the social organizational contexts of IT use.  Agent-based modeling is introduced as the analytical tool for computationally representing and examining the CAS model of IT use. The operationability of the CAS model and the analytical tool are demonstrated through a theory-building exercise translating an interpretive case study of IT use to a specific version of the CAS model.  While Orlikowski (1996) raised questions regarding the impacts of employee learning, IT flexibility, and workplace rigidity on IT-based organization transformation, the CAS model indicates that these factors in individual-level actions do not have a direct causal linkage with organizational- level IT use patterns and outcomes. This theory-building exercise manifests the intriguing nature of the bottom-up IT use process:  collective-level IT use patterns and outcomes are the logical and yet often unintended or unforeseeable consequences of individual-level behaviors. The CAS model of IT use offers opportunities for expanding the theoretical and methodological scope of the IT use literature.","https://misq.umn.edu/capturing-bottom-up-information-technology-use-processes-a-complex-adaptive-systems-model.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['collective-level', 'individual-level', 'social organizational contexts']","The article discusses collective-level IT use patterns and the social organizational contexts of IT use, which hints at an awareness of social dynamics in technology use.

There is an intuitive assumption among some proponents of IT that the CIO should always report to the CEO to promote the importance of IT and the CIO\u2019s clout in the firm, while some adversaries of IT call for a CIO\u2013CFO reporting structure to keep a tab on IT spending.  However, we challenge these two ad hoc prescriptions by arguing that neither CIO reporting structure is necessarily optimal, and that the CIO reporting structure should not be used to gauge the strategic role of IT in the firm. \n\nFirst, extending the strategy\u2013structure paradigm, we propose that a firm\u2019s strategic positioning (differentiation or cost leadership) should be a primary determinant of its CIO reporting structure.  We hypothesize that differentiators are more likely to have their CIO report to the CEO in order to pursue IT initiatives that help the firm\u2019s differentiation strategy.  We also hypothesize that cost leaders are more likely to have their CIO report to the CFO to lead IT initiatives to facilitate the firm\u2019s cost leadership strategy.  Second, extending the alignment\u2013fit view, we propose that firms that align their CIO reporting structure with their strategic positioning (specifically, differentiation with a CIO\u2013CEO reporting structure and cost leadership with a CIO\u2013CFO reporting structure) will have superior future performance.\n\nLongitudinal data from two periods (1990\u20131993 and 2006) support the proposed hypotheses, validating the relationship between a firm\u2019s strategic positioning and its CIO reporting structure, and also the positive impact of their alignment on firm performance.  These results challenge the ad hoc prescriptions about the CIO reporting structure, demonstrating that a CIO\u2013CEO reporting structure is only superior for differentiators and a CIO\u2013CFO reporting structure is superior only for cost leaders.  The CIO reporting structure must, therefore, be designed to align with the firm\u2019s strategic positioning, independent of whether IT plays a key strategic role in the firm.","https://misq.umn.edu/cio-reporting-structure-strategic-positioning-and-firm-performance.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CIO reporting structures and their alignment with business strategies, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet with a recent rise in environmental volatility, firms are asking how to be more agile in identifying and responding to market-based threats and opportunities.  Whether alignment helps or hurts agility is an unresolved issue.  This paper presents a variety of arguments from the literature that alternately predict a positive or negative relationship between alignment and agility.  This relationship is then tested using a model in which agility mediates the link between alignment and firm performance under varying conditions of IT infrastructure flexibility and environmental volatility.  Using data from a matched survey of IT and business executives in 241 firms, we uncover a positive and significant link between alignment and agility and between agility and firm performance.  We also show that the effect of alignment on performance is fully mediated by agility, that environmental volatility positively moderates the link between agility and firm performance, and that agility has a greater impact on firm performance in more volatile markets.  While IT infrastructure flexibility does not moderate the link between alignment and agility, except in a volatile environment, we reveal that IT infrastructure flexibility has a positive and significant main effect on agility.  In fact, the effect of IT infrastructure flexibility on agility is as strong as the effect of alignment on agility.

In this paper, we develop models to assess the risk of failure on the availability of an information network due to attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities. Software vulnerabilities arise from software installed on the nodes of the network. When the same software stack is installed on multiple nodes on the network, software vulnerabilities are shared among them.  These shared vulnerabilities can result in correlated failure of multiple nodes resulting in longer repair times and greater loss of availability of the network.  Considering positive network effects (e.g., compatibility) alone without taking the risks of correlated failure and the resulting downtime into account would lead to overinvestment in homogeneous software deployment.  Exploiting characteristics unique to information networks, we present a queuing model that allows us to quantify downtime loss faced by a  rm as a function of (1) investment in security technologies to avert attacks, (2) software diversification to limit the risk of correlated failure under attacks, and (3) investment in IT resources to repair failures due to attacks.  The novelty of this method is that we endogenize the failure distribution and the node correlation distribution, and show how the diversification strategy and other security measures/investments may impact these two distributions, which in turn determine the security loss faced by the firm.  We analyze and discuss the effectiveness of diversification strategy under different operating conditions and in the presence of changing vulnerabilities.

Sound validity assessment of indicators is dependent on having an adequate overall model fit and on the relative stability of the parameter estimates for the latent variable and indicators as they appear in different models.  If the overall fit and stability of estimates are adequate, then a researcher can assess validity using the unstandardized and standardized validity coefficients and the unique validity variance estimate.  With multiple causal indicators or with effect indicators influenced by multiple latent variables, collinearity diagnostics are useful.

The key approach to address privacy concerns is via the protection of privacy through the implementation of fair information practices, a set of standards governing the collection and use of personal information.  In this paper, we take a game-theoretic approach to explore the motivation of firms for privacy protection and its impact on competition and social welfare in the context of product and price personalization.  We find that privacy protection can work as a competition-mitigating mechanism by generating asymmetry in the consumer segments to which firms offer personalization, enhancing the profit extraction abilities of the firms.  In equilibrium, both symmetric and asymmetric choices of privacy protection by the firms can result, depending on the size of the personalization scope and the investment cost of protection.  Further, as consumers become more concerned about their privacy, it is more likely that all firms adopt privacy protection.  In the perspective of welfare, we show that autonomous choices of privacy protection by personalizing firms can improve social welfare at the expense of consumer welfare.  We further find that regulation enforcing the implementation of fair information practices can be efficient from the social welfare perspective mainly by limiting the incentives of the firms to exploit the competition-mitigation effect.","https://misq.umn.edu/managing-consumer-privacy-concerns-in-personalization-a-strategic-analysis-of-privacy-protection.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","6","['privacy', 'fair information practices', 'social welfare']","The article discusses privacy concerns and the implementation of fair information practices, indicating a focus on ethical considerations in information systems.

But does this work?  We propose that, in a capital market setting, establishing standards in a group does not decrease the total risk faced by an individual firm\u2019s shareholders.  However, the market risks its investors face decrease and idiosyncratic risks increase, changing the risk profiles of the group members.  We collected data on standard-setting events from 1996 to 2005.  In our dataset, a firm obtained a 4.07 percent, three-day cumulative risk-adjusted return on stock price when engaging in a standard-setting initiative, after controlling event year, firm size, and group size.  More importantly, we found that an increase in the number of firms in the group decreased the risk-adjusted abnormal return and the market risk (as measured by beta) of each firm, but increased the idiosyncratic risk (as measured by the variance of firm returns).  Our findings suggest that firms electing to participate in a large standardization group obtain a reduction in abnormal returns on stocks on the days of the standard-setting events.  They also expect to reduce market risks but increase idiosyncratic risks after the standard-setting events, as compared to firms choosing to participate in a smaller group or attempting to standardize their products unilaterally.

This oversight is somewhat surprising given that end-of-life decisions can have significant implications for user effectiveness, the value extracted from IS investments, and organizational performance.  Given this apparent gap, a multi-method empirical study was undertaken to improve our understanding of organizational level information system discontinuance.  Research commenced with the development of a broad theoretical framework consistent with the technology\u2013organization\u2013 environment (TOE) paradigm.  The resulting framework was then used to guide a series of semi-structured interviews with organizational decision makers in an effort to inductively identify salient influences on the formation of IS discontinuance intentions.  A set of research hypotheses were formulated based on the understanding obtained during these interviews and subsequently tested via a random survey of senior IS decision makers at U.S. and Canadian organizations.  Data obtained from the survey responses was analyzed using partial least squares (PLS).  Results of this analysis suggest that system capability shortcomings, limited availability of system support, and low levels of technical integration were key determinants of increased intentions to replace an existing system.

Given the emergence of large-scale social virtual worlds, such as Second Life, and the dramatic growth in sales of virtual goods, it is important to understand the dynamics that govern the purchase of virtual goods in virtual worlds.  Employing the stimulus\u2013organism\u2013response (S-O-R) framework, we investigate how technological (interactivity and sociability) and spatial (density and stability) environments in virtual worlds influence the participants\u2019 virtual experiences (telepresence, social presence, and flow), and how experiences subsequently affect their response (intention to purchase virtual goods).  The results of our survey of 354 Second Life residents indicate that interactivity, which enhances the interaction with objects, has a significant positive impact on telepresence and flow.  Also, sociability, which fosters interactions with participants, is significantly associated with social presence, although no such significant impact was observed on flow.  Furthermore, both density and stability are found to significantly influence participants\u2019 virtual experiences; stability helps users to develop strong social bonds, thereby increasing both social presence and flow.  However, contrary to our prediction of curvilinear patterns, density is linearly associated with flow and social presence.  Interestingly, the results exhibit two opposing effects of density:  while it reduces the extent of flow, density increases the amount of social presence.  Since social presence is found to increase flow, the net impact of density on flow depends heavily on the relative strength of the associations involving these three constructs.  Finally, we find that flow mediates the impacts of technological and spatial environments on intention to purchase virtual products.

Our approach involves two components.  First, we review the characteristics of agent-based virtual worlds (ABVWs) to discern design requirements that may challenge current design theory.  From this review, we derive a set of design principles based on deep versus emergent structures where deep structures reflect conventional modeling and simulation system architectures and emergent structures capture the unpredictable user\u2013system dynamics inherent in emergent knowledge processes, which increasingly characterize virtual worlds.  We illustrate how these design challenges are addressed with an exemplar of a complex mirror world, a large-scale ABVW we developed called Sentient World.  Our contribution is the insight of partitioning ABVW architectures into deep and emergent structures that mirror modeling systems and emergent knowledge processes respectively, while developing extended design principles to facilitate their integration.

The findings suggest that the 3D virtual world environment produces both positive and negative effects on brand equity when compared to the 2D environment.  The positive effect of the 3D virtual world environment on brand equity occurs through telepresence, a specific aspect of flow, as well as enjoyment.  The negative effect on brand equity can be explained using distraction\u2013conflict theory in which attentional conflicts faced by users of a highly interactive and rich medium resulted in distractions from attending to the brand.  Brand equity, in turn, has a positive effect on behavioral intention.  The results suggest that although the 3D virtual world environment has the potential to increase brand equity by offering an immersive and enjoyable virtual product experience, the rich environment can also be a distraction.  Therefore, developers of virtual world branding sites need to take into account limitations in the information processing capacity and attention span of users when designing their sites in order to avoid cognitive overload, which can lead to users being distracted from branding information.

Among the more grievous problems is the inability to attract users back into a virtual environment.  In this study, we propose and test a model to predict users\u2019 intentions to return to a virtual world.  Our model is based on the idea that users intend to return to a virtual world having conceived of it as a \u201cplace\u201d in which they have had meaningful experiences.  We rely on the interactionist theory of place attachment to explain the links among the constructs of our model.  Our model is tested via a lab experiment.  We find that users\u2019 intentions to return to a virtual world is determined by a state of deep involvement (termed cognitive absorption) that users experience as they perform an activity and tend to lose track of time.  In turn, cognitive absorption is determined by users\u2019 awareness of whom they interact with and how they interact within a virtual world, what they interact about, and where, in a virtual sense, such interaction occurs.

Users of such systems create publicly viewable lists of bookmarks (each being a hyperlink to an information resource) and often assign searchable keywords (\u201ctags\u201d) to these bookmarks.  We explore two different perspectives on how accessing others\u2019 bookmarks could enhance how innovative an individual is at work.  First, we develop two hypotheses around the idea that quantity may be a proxy for diversity, following a well established literature that holds that the more information obtained and the larger the number of sources consulted, the higher the likelihood an individual will come across novel ideas.  Next, we offer two hypotheses adapted from social network research that argue that the shape of the network of connections that is created when individuals access each others\u2019 bookmarks can reflect information novelty, and that individuals whose networks bridge more structural holes and have greater effective reach are likely to be more innovative.  An analysis of bookmarking system use in a global professional services firm provides strong support for the social diversity of information sources as a predictor of employee innovativeness, but no support that the number of bookmarks accessed matters.

Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power.  Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing.  We describe six roles for predictive analytics:  new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena.  Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature.  Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model.  However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well.  To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process.  These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power.  We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.","https://misq.umn.edu/predictive-analytics-in-information-systems-research.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of predictive analytics in information systems without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The dominant literature on the strategic fit of a firm\u2019s information systems focuses primarily on high-level measures of the strategic fit of a firm\u2019s overall IS portfolio and the impact of fit on business performance.  This paper addresses the need for a more fine-grained approach for assessing the specific areas of misfit between a firm\u2019s competitive strategies and IS capabilities.  We describe the design and evaluation of a multilevel strategic fit (MSF) measurement model that enables researchers and practitioners to measure the strategic fit of a firm\u2019s information systems at both an overall and a detailed level. The steps in the model include identifying the relevant IS capabilities according to the type of system; measuring the current level of support for each capability using a capabilities instrument; identifying the ideal level of support for each capability using an adaptation of Conant et al.\u2019s (1990) instrument to assess strategic archetype; and comparing the ideal and realized level of support for each capability.  Evidence from a multiple case study analysis indicates that the fine-grained assessment of strategic fit can strengthen the validity, utility, and ease of corroboration of the strategic fit measurement outputs.  The paper also demonstrates how an iterative design science research approach, with its emphasis on evaluating the utility of prototype artifacts, is well suited to developing field-tested and theoretically grounded measurement models and instruments that are accessible to practitioners.

Rather, effective group-level IS proficiency may also be a function of how a group\u2019s IS proficiency is distributed across its members.  Relying on concepts associated with social network analysis (SNA), we introduce the concept of centrality\u2013IS proficiency alignment.

The research reported in this article approaches this question from two theoretical perspectives.  The first of these argues that an interface with a dominant market share benefits from the absence of competition because users acquire skills that are specific to that particular interface, which in turn reduces the probability that they will switch to a new competitor interface in the future.  By contrast, the second perspective proposes that the advantage that a market leader has in being able to install a set of non-transferable skills in its user base is offset by a psychological force that causes humans to react against perceived constraints on their freedom of choice.  We test a research model that incorporates the key predictions of these two theoretical perspectives in an experiment involving consequential interface choices.

A significant constraint on the effectiveness of such systems is that they assume workers know what knowledge they need (they know what they don\u2019t know) when, in fact, they often do not know what knowledge they need (they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know).  A way to overcome this problem is to use visual ontologies to help users learn relevant concepts and relationships in the knowledge domain, enabling them to search the knowledge base in a more educated manner.  However, no guidelines exist for designing such ontologies.  To fill this gap, we draw on theories of philosophical ontology and cognition to propose guidelines for designing visual ontologies for knowledge identification.\n\n\t\tWe conducted three experiments to compare the effectiveness of guided ontologies, visual ontologies that followed our guidelines, to unguided ontologies, visual ontologies that violated our guidelines.  We found that subjects performed considerably better with the guided ontologies, and that subjects could perceive the benefits of using guided ontologies, at least in some circumstances.  On the basis of these results, we conclude that the way visual ontologies are presented makes a difference in knowledge identification and that theories of philosophical ontology and cognition can guide the construction of more effective visual representations.  Furthermore, we propose that the principles we used to create the guided visual ontologies can be generalized for other cases where visual models are used to inform users about application domains.","https://misq.umn.edu/guidelines-for-designing-visual-ontologies-to-support-knowledge-identification.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['knowledge management', 'visual ontologies', 'cognition']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of knowledge management systems and the design of visual ontologies, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways:  (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis:  individual, group, organizational, and societal.\n\n\t\tBased upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside:   the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. \n\n\t\tAs we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions.  First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy.  Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value.  Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date.  Future empirical studies\u2014both positivist and interpretive\u2014could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis.  Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes.

We focus on one specific type of success as measured by the rate of knowledge creation in an open source project.  Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a longitudinal panel of 2,378 projects hosted at SourceForge.  We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects.  Our main results are as follows.  First, projects with greater internal cohesion (that is, cohesion among the project members) are more successful.  Second, external cohesion (that is, cohesion among the external contacts of a project) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project\u2019s success; moderate levels of external cohesion are best for a project\u2019s success rather than very low or very high levels.  Third, the technological diversity of the external network of a project also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high.

In this paper, we inform researchers about the current state of information privacy research in IS through a critical analysis of the IS literature that considers information privacy as a key construct.  The review of the literature reveals that information privacy is a multilevel concept, but rarely studied as such.  We also find that information privacy research has been heavily reliant on student-based and USA-centric samples, which results in findings of limited generalizability.  Information privacy research focuses on explaining and predicting theoretical contributions, with few studies in journal articles focusing on design and action contributions.  We recommend that future research should consider different levels of analysis as well as multilevel effects of information privacy.  We illustrate this with a multilevel framework for information privacy concerns.

Personalized product recommendations (PPRs) adapted to individual customers\u2019 preferences and tastes are one IT-enabled strategy that has been widely adopted by online retailers to enhance customers\u2019 shopping experience.  Although many online retailers have implemented PPRs on their electronic storefronts to improve customer retention, empirical evidence for the effects of PPRs on retention is sparse, and the limited anecdotal evidence is contradictory.  We draw upon the household production function model in the consumer economics literature to develop a theoretical framework that explains the mechanisms through which PPRs influence customer store loyalty in electronic markets.  We suggest that retailer learning that occurs as a result of customer knowledge obtained to enable personalization influences the efficiency of the online product brokering activity.  Data collected from a two-phase lab experiment with 253 student subjects where the quality of PPRs was manipulated are used to empirically test the predictions of the theoretical model.  Empirical analyses of the data indicate that retailer learning reflected in higher quality PPRs is associated with lower product screening cost, but higher product evaluation cost.  We further find that higher quality PPRs are associated with greater value derived by consumers from the online product brokering activity in terms of higher decision making quality, which is positively associated with repurchase intention.

We propose and theorize this frequently observed but understudied IT\u2013agility contradiction by which IT may enable or impede agility.  We develop the premise that organizations need to develop superior firm-wide IT capability to successfully manage their IT resources to realize agility.  We refine the conceptualization and measurement of IT capability as a latent construct reflected in its three dimensions:  IT infrastructure capability, IT business spanning capability, and IT proactive stance.  We also conceptualize two types of organizational agility:  market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility.  We then conduct a matched-pair field survey of business and information systems executives in 128 organizations to empirically examine the link between a firm\u2019s IT capability and agility.  Business executives responded to measurement scales of the two types of agility and organizational context variables, and IS executives responded to measurement scales of IT capabilities and IS context variables.  The results show a significant positive relationship between IT capability and the two types of organizational agility.  We also find a significant positive joint effect of IT capability and IT spending on operational adjustment agility but not on market capitalizing agility.  The findings suggest a possible resolution to the contradictory effect of IT on agility:  while more IT spending does not lead to greater agility, spending it in such a way as to enhance and foster IT capabilities does.

Known as \u201ccopula models,\u201d they have a number of attractive features. First, they permit the combination of any univariate marginal distributions that need not come from the same distributional family. Second, a particular class of copula models, called \u201celliptical copula,\u201d has the property that they increase in complexity at a much slower rate than existing multivariate probability models as the number of dimensions increase. Third, they are very general, encompassing a number of existing multivariate models and providing a framework for generating many more. These advantages give copula models a greater potential for use in empirical analysis than existing probability models used in marketing. We exploit and extend recent developments in Bayesian estimation to propose an approach that allows reliable estimation of elliptical copula models in high dimensions. Rather than focusing on a single marketing problem, we demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of copula models with four examples to show the flexibility of the method. In every case, the copula model either handles a situation that could not be modeled previously or gives improved accuracy compared with prior models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1090.0491","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical modeling in marketing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The online channel offers potential benefits in selling to customer segments that value the convenience of online shopping, but it also raises new challenges. These include the higher likelihood of costly product returns when customers' ability to \u201ctouch and feel\u201d products is important in determining fit. We study competing retailers that can operate dual channels (\u201cbricks and clicks\u201d) and examine how pricing strategies and physical store assistance levels change as a result of the additional Internet outlet. A central result we obtain is that when differentiation among competing retailers is not too high, having an online channel can actually increase investment in store assistance levels (e.g., greater shelf display, more-qualified sales staff, floor samples) and decrease profits. Consequently, when the decision to open an Internet channel is endogenized, there can exist an asymmetric equilibrium where only one retailer elects to operate an online arm but earns lower profits than its bricks-only rival. We also characterize equilibria where firms open an online channel, even though consumers only use it for research and learning purposes but buy in stores. A number of extensions are discussed, including retail settings where firms carry multiple product categories, shipping and handling costs, and the role of store assistance in impacting consumer perceived benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0588","","MKS","Marketing","2","['flexibility', 'customer segments', 'convenience', 'challenges']","The article primarily focuses on the operational strategies of multichannel retailers without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Hierarchical effects occur when relationships among variables are mediated through other variables. Challenges in studying hierarchical effects in marketing include the large number of items present in most commercial studies and the presence of heterogeneous relationships among the variables. Existing approaches have dealt with the large number of variables by employing a factor structure representation of the data and have used standard mixture distributions for representing different response segments. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model for the analysis of hierarchical data using the actual response items and incorporating heterogeneity that better reflects consumer stages in a decision process. Cross-sectional data from a national brand-tracking study are used to illustrate our model, where we find empirical support for a hierarchical relationship among media recall, brand beliefs, and intended actions. We find these effects to be insignificant when measured with standard models and aggregate analyses. The proposed model is useful for understanding the influence of variables that lead to intermediate as opposed to direct effects on brand choice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0602","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of hierarchical effects in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This promotion strategy, which we call \u201ccross-market discounts,\u201d has been successfully adopted in the last few years by many grocery retailers in partnership with gasoline retailers across North America, Europe, and Australia. In this paper, we use an analytical model to investigate the major forces driving the profitability of this novel promotion strategy. We consider a generalized scenario in which purchases in a source market lead to price discounts redeemable in a target market. Our analysis shows that this strategy can be a revenue driver by simultaneously increasing prices as well as sales in the source market, even though we assume the demand curve to be downward sloping in price. Moreover, it distributes additional consumption (motivated by the discount) in two markets, and under diminishing marginal returns from consumption, this can simultaneously increase firm profits and consumer welfare more effectively than traditional nonlinear pricing strategies. Our study provides many other interesting insights as well, and our key results are in accordance with anecdotal evidence obtained from managers and industry publications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0603","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a marketing strategy aimed at profitability and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

For example, the front page of a newspaper provides a preview to potential newspaper buyers before they purchase the product. In this context, a news provider can provide previews that are highly informative about the content of the news product. Conversely, a news provider can utilize a preview that is relatively uninformative. We examine the incentives that firms have to adopt different preview strategies in a context where they do not have complete control of product positioning. Our analysis shows that preview strategy can be a useful source of differentiation. However, when a firm adopts a strategy of providing informative previews, it confers a positive externality on a competitor that utilizes uninformative previews. This reinforces the incentive of the competitor to use uninformative previews and explains why the market landscape in news provision is often characterized by asymmetric competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0606","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on competition and product preview strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based personalization in competitive markets. First, although purchase histories reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such information damages differentiation, similar to the classic finding that behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the information value of purchase histories. Ideally, if a market leader serves all consumers on day 1, purchase histories contain no information about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are willing to accommodate a market leader, firms are more likely to offer a mainstream design at day 1, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0607","","MKS","Marketing","3","['personalization', 'consumer preferences', 'exploitation']","The article discusses the implications of behavior-based personalization in marketing, touching on consumer preferences and competitive exploitation.

These results imply that not accounting for right truncation can lead managers to rely too much on word of mouth in generating new product adoption and to poorly identify the customers most likely to adopt early. Not accounting for right truncation can also lead to suboptimal pricing decisions and to erroneous assessments of variations in customer lifetime value.

Contrary to extant theory, technologies that adopt a lower attack (\u201cpotentially disruptive technologies\u201d) (1) are introduced as frequently by incumbents as by entrants, (2) are not cheaper than older technologies, and (3) rarely disrupt firms; and (4) both entrants and lower attacks significantly reduce the hazard of disruption.

Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision, although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable.

Our dynamic model allows researchers to investigate brand positioning in new categories or mature categories affected by structural change such as entry. We argue that even for mature categories not affected by structural change, the assumption of stable attributes may be untenable. We allow for evolution in attributes by modeling individual-level time-specific attributes as arising from dynamic means. The dynamic attribute means are modeled as a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). The DLM is nested within a factor-analytic choice model. Our approach makes efficient use of the data by leveraging estimates from previous and future periods to estimate current period attributes. We demonstrate the robustness of our model with data that simulate a variety of dynamic scenarios, including stationary behavior. We show that misspecified attribute dynamics induce temporal heteroskedasticty and correlation between the preference weights and the error term. Applying the model to a panel data set on household purchases in the malt beverage category, we find considerable evidence for dynamics in the latent brand attributes.

In this paper, we develop a method to construct efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to both conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. Under certain conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and disjunctions of conjunctions screening rules. Based on the local design criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and conjunctive designs\u2014the former are optimized for a compensatory model and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more utility balance. We find that compensatory designs have a significant loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast, when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory choice process.

Simulation pseudo-bias correction to the harmonic mean estimator of integrated likelihoods. J. Comput. Graph.

Relaxing the assumption that model errors are distributed normally eliminates all instances in which the cross-brand pass-through model is selected. In 10 additional categories, the harmonic-mean-estimated Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through 69% of the time, whereas a finite variance estimator of the Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through only 5% of the time.

Our analyses show that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption smoothing at various levels\u2014intertemporal, intercategory, and intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis. Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption smoothing across different types of economies.

Results show that prototypical but complex car designs feel surprisingly fluent to process, and that this form of surprising fluency evokes positive gut reactions that become associated with the design and positively impact car sales. It is important to note that the effect holds for both economy (functionality oriented) and premium (identity oriented) cars, as well as when the above-mentioned traditional forecasting variables are considered.

We present a model of electoral competition in which ads inform voters either of the good traits of the candidate or of the bad traits of his opponent. We find that in equilibrium, the proportion of negative ads depends on both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, for an interesting subset of the parameter space, negativity increases in both knowledge and budget. Using data on the elections for the U.S. House of Representative in 2000, 2002, and 2004, we examine the model and its implications. Using nonstructural estimation, we find that negativity indeed increases in both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, we also find that knowledge and budget mediate the effect of closeness on negativity. Using structural estimation, we reinforce these findings. Specifically, we find that the model's parameters are within the subset of the parameter space discussed above. Thus, the evidence implies that the model is not only helpful in identifying variables that were ignored by previous studies (i.e., knowledge and budget) but also in explaining an intriguing empirical regularity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0638","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the dynamics of negative advertising in political campaigns without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Marketers often have access to data on interactions among customers from which, with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting activities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0640","","MKS","Marketing","2","['homophily', 'customer interactions', 'segmentation']","The article focuses on a technical framework for modeling customer interactions based on the theory of homophily, which is primarily a marketing concept.

We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of cross-category substitution by the consumer, caused by \u201cvariety-seeking\u201d tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions\u2014customized timing of price reductions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0643","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and marketing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In such a scenario, how can Prudential achieve meaningful product differentiation to increase the sales of its variable annuities? The solution led to the development and implementation of the \u201cEmotion Quotient\u201d (EQ) Tool. The EQ Tool enabled Prudential to redefine its marketing and sales approach along a proactive (as opposed to responsive) market orientation paradigm. This was accomplished by first using the EQ Tool to uncover and quantify the prevalence of certain emotions (such as fear and regret) in the prospective consumer and then pitching relevant variable annuity product(s) that could mitigate the specific behavioral risk corresponding to the prevalent emotion(s). This approach, which was backed by extensive research (as described in this study), enabled Prudential to gain over $450 million lift in variable annuity sales and contributed to consumer welfare by promoting awareness of behavioral risk to investors who are within five years of their retirement.

This paper proposes an interactive, dynamic pricing strategy from the perspective of customized bundling to derive savings for customers while maximizing profits for electronic retailers (\u201ce-tailers\u201d). Given product costs, posted prices, shipping fees, and customers' reservation prices, we propose a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model to increase e-tailers' profits by sequentially pricing customized bundles. The model is flexible in terms of the number and variety of products customers may choose to incorporate during the various stages of their online shopping. Our computational study suggests that the proposed model not only attracts more customers to purchase the discounted bundle but also noticeably increases profits for e-tailers. This online dynamic bundle pricing model is robust under various bundle sizes and scenarios. It improves e-tailer profit and customer savings the most when facing divergent views about product values, lower budgets, and higher cost ratios.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1100.0631","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies and profit maximization for e-tailers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic expansions versus periods of economic contractions\u2014and whether these results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U.S. firms across a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R&D and advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in R&D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If in contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to choose between either maintaining R&D or advertising, our simulation results show that maintaining R&D is associated with better company performance. We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree of cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant, and they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in highly cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its total effect being 50% larger (market share) and 200% larger (profits) than in industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions. Collectively, these findings provide valuable and actionable insights into how firms should respond to contractions in order to grow profits and market share.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0641","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the effectiveness of R&D and advertising during economic contractions, with an emphasis on financial metrics like profit and market share.

Internet-based media have facilitated information exchange among firms and consumers, as well as observability and measurement of such exchanges. However, much of the research addressing online communication focuses on ratings collected from online forums. In this paper, we look beyond ratings to a more comprehensive view of online communications. We consider the sales effect of the volume of positive, negative, and neutral online communications captured by Web crawler technology and classified by automated sentiment analysis. Our modeling approach captures two key features of our data, dynamics and endogeneity. In terms of dynamics, we model daily measures of online communications about a firm and its products as contributing to a latent demand-generating stock variable. To account for the endogeneity, we extend the latent instrumental variable technique to account for dynamic endogenous regressors. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of positive, negative, and neutral online communications on daily sales performance. Failure to account for endogeneity results in a severe attenuation of the estimated effects. From a managerial perspective, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for communication valence as well as the impact of shocks to positive, negative, and neutral online communications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0642","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of online communications and their impact on sales without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of these expenditures is that decisions such as whether to lower prices or run promotions are made based on managers' knowledge of how sensitive consumers are to these marketing activities. Although marketing control variables are explanatory of sales, they are often set in anticipation of a market response, which reflects strategic behavior on the part of a firm. A challenge in developing a model of strategic behavior is that the process by which marketing expenditures are made is often not directly observable. We propose tests for comparing supply-side model formulations in which input variables are strategically determined. In these models, the joint likelihood of demand (y) and supply (x) can be factored into a conditional factor of demand given supply and into a marginal factor of supply.

We explicitly model how consumers navigate and click on sponsored links based on their knowledge and beliefs about firm qualities. Our model yields several interesting insights; a main counterintuitive result we focus on is the \u201cposition paradox.\u201d The paradox is that a superior firm may bid lower than an inferior firm and obtain a position below it, yet it still obtains more clicks than the inferior firm. Under a pay-per-impression mechanism, the inferior firm wants to be at the top where more consumers click on its link, whereas the superior firm is better off by placing its link at a lower position because it pays a smaller advertising fee, but some consumers will still reach it in search of the higher-quality firm. Under a pay-per-click mechanism, the inferior firm has an even stronger incentive to be at the top because now it only has to pay for the consumers who do not know the firms' reputations and, therefore, can bid more aggressively. Interestingly, as the quality premium for the superior firm increases, and/or if more consumers know the identity of the superior firm, the incentive for the inferior firm to be at the top may increase. Contrary to conventional belief, we find that the search engine may have the incentive to overweight the inferior firm's bid and strategically create the position paradox to increase overall clicks by consumers. To validate our model, we analyze a data set from a popular Korean search engine firm and find that (i) a large proportion of auction outcomes in the data show the position paradox, and (ii) sharp predictions from our model are validated in the data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0645","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding strategies in sponsored search auctions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The convenient method that excludes the consumers with missingness in any covariate can result in a substantial loss of efficiency and may lead to strong selection bias in the estimation of consumer preferences and sensitivities. To solve these problems, we propose a new Bayesian distribution-free approach, which can ensure that no customer is left behind in the analysis as a result of missing covariates. In this way, all customers are being considered in devising managerial policies. The proposed approach allows for flexible modeling of a joint distribution of multidimensional interrelated covariates that can contain both continuous and discrete variables. At the same time, it minimizes the impact of distributional assumptions involved in covariate modeling because the method does not require researchers to specify parametric distributions for covariates and can automatically generate suitable distributions for missing covariates. We have developed an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference. Besides robustness and flexibility, the proposed approach reduces modeling and computational efforts associated with missing covariates and therefore makes the missing covariate problems easier to handle. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using extensive simulation studies. We then illustrate the method in two real data examples in which missing covariates occur: a mixed multinomial logit discrete-choice model in a ketchup data set and a hierarchical probit purchase incidence model in a retail store data set. These analyses demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes several important limitations of existing approaches for solving missing covariate problems and offers opportunities to make better managerial decisions with the current available marketing databases. Although our applications focus on consumer-level data, the proposed method is general and can be applied to other marketing applications where other types of marketing players are the units of analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0648","","MKS","Marketing","3","['customer', 'missingness', 'managerial policies']","The article discusses the importance of considering all customers in marketing analyses, which aligns with themes of inclusivity.

Here, we focus on a particular aspect of the advertising content choice: an attribute-focused appeal versus an appeal with no direct information on product attributes. We make two assumptions that capture the reality of the advertising context. First, we assume that the bandwidth of advertising is limited: a firm can only communicate about a limited number of attributes. Second, we assume that consumers are active: they can choose to engage in a costly search to obtain additional product-related information. In this setting, we show that there exists an equilibrium where the high-quality firm chooses to produce messages devoid of any attribute information in order to invite the consumer to engage in search, which is likely to uncover positive information about the product. Whereas most of the previous literature has focused on the decision to advertise as a signal of quality, we show that message content, coupled with consumer search, can also serve as a credible signal of quality. In an extension, we show that our results are robust to endogenizing the firm's decision on the amount of advertising spending.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0651","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The proposed model uses behavioral primitives in accord with utility maximization and allows recovering parameters of the heterogeneity distribution in consumer preferences. The model is estimated on a novel paid search data set that includes information on the ad copy. To that end, we develop an original framework to analyze composition and design attributes of paid search ads. Our results allow us to correctly evaluate the effects of specific ad properties on ad performance, taking consumer heterogeneity into account. Another benefit of our approach is allowing recovery of preference correlation across the click-through and conversion stage. Based on the estimated correlation between price- and position-sensitivity, we propose a novel contextual targeting scheme in which a coupon is offered to a consumer depending on the position in which the paid search ad was displayed. Our analysis shows that total revenues from conversion can be increased using this targeting scheme while keeping cost constant.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0647","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for analyzing paid search advertising without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

First, we identify the market conditions under which ex ante homogeneous consumers may choose to purchase at different times. Second, equilibrium adoption may demonstrate inertia (where all adopt late) or frenzy (where all adopt early). In particular, adoption inertia appears when SL intensity is reasonably high but may vanish when SL intensity exceeds a certain threshold. Third, firm profits and social welfare first weakly decrease in SL intensity and may then jump up by a lump-sum amount at the threshold SL intensity level mentioned above.

We show that although firms seek to manage competition through product positioning, their differentiation strategies critically depend on how costly it is to provide higher quality. When the cost of providing quality is not too high, firms use only one attribute to differentiate their products: they maximally differentiate on one dimension and minimally differentiate on the other (a Max-Min equilibrium). Furthermore, they always differentiate along the dimension with the greater attribute range. As for the dimension with the smaller range and along which they agglomerate, firms either choose the highest quality level or the lowest quality level possible, depending on whether the marginal costs of quality provision are low or intermediate, respectively. However, for larger quality provision costs, firms exploit both dimensions to differentiate their products. In particular, we characterize a maximal differentiation equilibrium in which one firm chooses the highest quality level on both attributes while its rival offers the lowest quality level on both attributes (a Max-Max equilibrium). We discuss the managerial implications of our findings and explain how they enrich and qualify previous results reported in the literature on two-dimensional differentiation models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0652","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product positioning and differentiation strategies without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Conventional wisdom would suggest that a customer in a higher relationship state that has a higher transaction value would also have greater lifetime value to the firm. However, recent evidence suggests that higher relationship states can be ephemeral. Hence, the link between transaction value and lifetime value is not obvious. In this study, we seek to understand, within a specific empirical context, (i) the relationship between a customer's transaction value and that customer's lifetime value and (ii) the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the optimal level of marketing activity that needs to be directed at that customer. To this end, we develop a trivariate Tobit hidden Markov model that allows for (a) transitions among relationship states, (b) possible synergies between the various products that the supplier firm offers, (c) endogeneity in marketing activity, (d) heterogeneity in model parameters, and (e) the presence of the no-purchase option. Our results reinforce recent findings by Schweidel et al. [Schweidel, D. A., E. T. Bradlow, P. S. Fader. 2011. Portfolio dynamics for customers of a multiservice provider. Management Sci.57(3) 471\u2013486] that higher relationship states can be short-lived. Importantly for the supplier firm, a customer in the highest relationship state in a given period does not yield the highest lifetime value to the firm. Hence, the relationship between transaction value (i.e., relationship state) and lifetime value can be nonmonotonic. At the same time, we also find a nonmonotonic relationship between the optimal expenditures that should be directed at a customer and that customer's lifetime value; i.e., the optimal level of marketing contacts is not the highest for customers with the highest lifetime value. Furthermore, we find that the optimal marketing expenditures for myopic agents are 14%\u201333% lower than the corresponding values for forward-looking agents. Therefore, not accounting for the long-term effects of marketing contacts would lead to suboptimal marketing budgets. Moreover, a comparison with the current marketing expenditures suggests that the current practice is closer to the myopic policy than to the forward-looking one.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0661","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing investments and customer relationship dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we investigate how the size of the low-end market influences a firm's profits and the pioneering firm's quality choice. As low-valuation consumers increase in a market, on average, consumers' willingness to pay decreases. This may lead us to expect firms' profits to decrease as the size of the low-end market increases. Our analysis shows that, if the size of the low-end market is below a threshold, an increase in the size of the low-end market may actually dampen price competition and improve profits, as firms can then strategically choose their quality levels such that their products are more differentiated. Conventional wisdom also suggests that the pioneering firm will offer a higher-quality product and earn more profits compared with the later entrant. In contrast to this notion of quality advantage, our analysis identifies circumstances in which a pioneer can offer a lower-quality product and yet earn more profits. An experimental test lends support for some of our model's predictions. We further extend the model to consider markets with multiple firms, firms with multiple products, and consumers with limited purchasing power.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0664","","MKS","Marketing","2","['low-end markets', 'consumers', 'pioneering firm']","The article focuses primarily on market dynamics and profitability in low-end markets with limited reference to social themes.

In this paper, we put forth a hierarchical competing-risk model to jointly model when customers choose to terminate their service and why. Some of these reasons for churn can be influenced by the firm (e.g., service problems or price\u2013value trade-offs), but others are uncontrollable (e.g., customer relocation and death). Using this framework, we demonstrate that the impact of a firm's efforts to reduce customer churn for controllable reasons is mitigated by the prevalence of uncontrollable ones, resulting in a \u201cdamper effect\u201d on the return from a firm's retention marketing efforts. We use data from a provider of land-based telecommunication services to demonstrate how the competing-risk model can be used to derive a measure of the incremental customer value that a firm can expect to accrue through its efforts to delay churn, taking this damper effect into account. In addition to varying across customers based on geodemographic information, the magnitude of the damper effect depends on a customer's tenure to date. We discuss how our framework can be used to tailor the firm's retention strategy to individual customers, both in terms of which customers to target and when retention efforts should be deployed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0665","","MKS","Marketing","2","['customer churn', 'geodemographic', 'retention strategy']","The article primarily focuses on customer retention and churn metrics without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Another requirement is that market response models predict well in a holdout sample. With both requirements combined, it may seem reasonable to subject an endogeneity-corrected model to a holdout prediction task, and this is quite common in the academic marketing literature. One may be inclined to expect that the consistent parameter estimates obtained via instrumental variables (IV) estimation predict better than the biased ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. This paper shows that this expectation is incorrect. That is, if the holdout sample is similar to the estimation sample so that the regressors are endogenous in both samples, holdout sample validation favors regression estimates that are not corrected for endogeneity (i.e., OLS) over estimates that are corrected for endogeneity (i.e., IV estimation). We also discuss ways in which holdout samples may be used sensibly in the presence of endogeneity. A key takeaway is that if consistent parameter estimates are the primary model objective, the model should be validated with an exogenous (rather than endogenous) holdout sample.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0666","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market response models and statistical validation without any mention of social issues, diversity, ethics, or other woke themes.

In this paper we present a dyadic consider-then-choose model that investigates both compensatory and noncompensatory aspects of the joint decision process. The intersection of individual consideration sets at the dyad level gives rise to dyadic decision processes (DDPs) where dyad members are in concordance or discordance about alternatives to consider. We empirically investigate the implications of different DDPs on outcomes such as decision efficiency and dyadic welfare. The methodological approach merges choice experiments with Bayesian statistical models to uncover nuances of the dyadic choice process. Data were collected using a multiphase nationwide study of 265 husband-and-wife dyads. Results across three categories indicate that both concordant and discordant dyads exist. Among concordant dyads, the noncompensatory dyads make quicker decisions that result in higher dyadic welfare. Among discordant dyads, those that restrict their consideration set make quicker decisions that result in higher welfare than those that expand their consideration set.

Although DRM is supposed to help copyright owners by protecting digital content from illegal copying or distribution, it is controversial because DRM imposes restrictions on even legal users, and there are many industry practitioners who believe that the industry would be better off without DRM. In this paper, we model consumers' utilities and their incentives to purchase legal products versus pirate illegal ones. This allows us to endogenize the level of piracy and understand how it is influenced by the presence or absence of DRM. Our analysis suggests that, counterintuitively, download piracy might decrease when the firm allows legal DRM-free downloads. Furthermore, we find that a decrease in piracy does not guarantee an increase in firm profits and that that copyright owners do not always benefit from making it harder to copy music illegally. By analyzing the competition among the traditional retailer, the digital retailer, and pirated sources of information goods, we get a better understanding of the competitive forces in the market and provide insights into the role of digital rights management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0668","","MKS","Marketing","3","['digital rights management', 'copyright', 'piracy']","The article discusses digital rights management and its implications for consumers and copyright owners, but it primarily focuses on technical and market dynamics rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

Our main insight is to use commonly observed discontinuities and kinks in the heuristics by which firms target such marketing activity to consumers for nonparametric identification. Such kinks, along with continuity restrictions that are typically satisfied in marketing and industrial organization applications, are sufficient for identification of local treatment effects. We review the theory of regression discontinuity estimation in the context of targeting and explore its applicability to several marketing settings. We discuss identifiability of causal marketing effects using the design and show that consideration of an underlying model of strategic consumer behavior reveals how identification hinges on model features such as the specification and value of structural parameters as well as belief structures. We emphasize the role of selection for identification. We present two empirical applications: the first measures the effect of casino e-mail promotions targeted to customers based on ranges of their expected profitability, and the second measures the effect of direct mail targeted by a business-to-consumer company to zip codes based on cutoffs of expected response. In both cases, we illustrate that exploiting the regression discontinuity design reveals negative effects of the marketing campaigns that would not have been uncovered using other approaches.

Unlike previous Bayesian learning models, we consider that some signals, such as positive and negative news releases and the firm's marketing effort, may be biased in that they provide an opinionated point of view. The results show interesting differences in how physician types (specialists, hospital-based primary care physicians, heavy and light prescribers) update their beliefs and the information sources they use to do so.

The basic framework typically starts from microfoundations of expected utility theory to obtain an econometric system that describes consumers' choices over available options, and to thus characterize product demand. The basic framework has been augmented significantly to account for quantity choices, to accommodate purchases of several products on a single purchase occasion (multiple discreteness and multicategory purchases), and to allow for asymmetric switching between brands across different price tiers. These extensions have enabled researchers to bring the analysis to bear on several related marketing phenomena of interest. This paper has three main objectives. The first objective is to articulate the main goals of demand analysis\u2014forecasting, measurement, and testing\u2014and to highlight several considerations associated with these goals. Our second objective is to describe the main building blocks of individual-level demand models. We discuss approaches built on direct and indirect utility specifications of demand systems, and we review extensions that have appeared in the marketing literature. The third objective is to explore a few emerging directions in demand analysis, including considering demand-side dynamics, combining purchase data with primary information, and using semiparametric and nonparametric approaches.

To address this question, we propose a dynamic model of brand advertising in which, at each instant, a nonzero probability exists for the occurrence of a crisis event that damages the brand's baseline sales and may enhance or erode marketing effectiveness when the crisis occurs. Because managers do not know when the crisis will occur, its random time of occurrence induces a stochastic control problem, which we solve analytically in closed form. More importantly, the envisioning of a possible crisis alters managers' rate of time preference: anticipation enhances impatience. That is, forward-looking managers discount the present\u2014even when the crisis has not occurred\u2014more than they would in the absence of crisis. Building on this insight, we then derive the optimal feedback advertising strategies and assess the effects of crisis likelihood and damage rate. We discover the crossover interaction: the optimal precrisis advertising decreases, but the postcrisis advertising increases as the crisis likelihood (or damage rate) increases. In addition, we develop a new continuous-time estimation method to simultaneously estimate sales dynamics and feedback strategies using discrete-time data. Applying the method to market data from the Ford Explorer's rollover recall, we furnish evidence to support the proposed model. We detect compensatory effects in parametric shift: ad effectiveness increases, but carryover effect decreases (or vice versa). We also characterize the crisis occurrence distribution that shows that Ford Explorer should anticipate a crisis in 2.1 years and within 6.3 years at the 95% confidence level. Finally, we find a remarkable correspondence between the observed and optimal advertising decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1110.0679","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising strategies in the context of product-harm crises without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to pass laws designed to protect consumer privacy by restricting the use of data and by restricting online tracking techniques used by websites. We use the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been randomly exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns to explore how privacy regulation in the European Union (EU) has influenced advertising effectiveness. This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries.

One potential weakness with parallel search is that it permits repetition. The same, or a similar, idea might be generated multiple times, because parallel exploration processes typically operate without information about the ideas that have already been identified. In this paper we analyze repetition in five data sets comprising 1,368 opportunities and use that analysis to address three questions: (1) When a large number of efforts to generate ideas are conducted in parallel, how likely are the resulting ideas to be redundant? (2) How large are the opportunity spaces? (3) Are the unique ideas more valuable than those similar to many others? The answer to the first question is that although there is clearly some redundancy in the ideas generated by aggregating parallel efforts, this redundancy is quite small in absolute terms in our data, even for a narrowly defined domain. For the second question, we propose a method to extrapolate how many unique ideas would result from an unbounded effort by an unlimited number of comparable idea generators. Applying that method, and for the settings we study, the estimated total number of unique ideas is about one thousand for the most narrowly defined domain and greater than two thousand for the more broadly defined domains. On the third question, we find a positive relationship between the number of similar ideas and idea value: the ideas that are least similar to others are not generally the most valuable ones.

However, longer service times also result in longer waits for customers. We term such services, in which the interaction between quality and speed is critical, as customer-intensive services. In a queueing framework, we parameterize the degree of customer intensity of the service. The service speed chosen by the service provider affects the quality of the service through its customer intensity. Customers queue for the service based on service quality, delay costs, and price.

But do hiring firms actually increase their use of new recruits' prior inventions? Our estimates suggest they do, quite significantly in fact, by approximately 219% on average. However, this does not necessarily reflect widespread \u201clearning by hiring.\u201d In fact, we estimate that a recruit's exploitation of her own prior ideas accounts for almost half of the above effect, with much of the diffusion to others being limited to the recruit's immediate collaborative network. Furthermore, although one might expect the recruit's role to diminish rapidly as her tacit knowledge diffuses across her new firm, our estimates indicate that her importance is surprisingly persistent over time. We base these findings on an empirical strategy that exploits the variation over time in hiring firms' citations to the recruits' premove patents. Specifically, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to compare premove versus postmove citation rates for the recruits' prior patents and corresponding matched-pair control patents. Our methodology has three benefits compared to previous studies that also examine the link between labor mobility and knowledge flow: (1) it does not suffer from the upward bias inherent in the conventional cross-sectional comparison, (2) it generates results that are robust to a more stringently matched control sample, and (3) it enables a temporal examination of knowledge flow patterns.

This paper examines this hypothesis by testing how different types of marketing expenditures are used to boost earnings for a durable commodity consumer product that can be easily stockpiled by end consumers. Combining supermarket scanner data with firm-level financial data, we find evidence that differs from prior literature. Instead of reducing expenditures to boost earnings, soup manufacturers roughly double the frequency and change the mix of marketing promotions (price discounts, feature advertisements, and aisle displays) at the fiscal quarter-end when they have greater incentive to boost earnings. Our results confirm managers' stated willingness to sacrifice long-term value in order to smooth earnings and their stated preference to use real actions to boost earnings to meet different types of earnings benchmarks. We estimate that marketing actions can be used to boost quarterly net income by up to 5% depending on the depth and duration of promotion. However, there is a price to pay, with the cost in the following period being approximately 7.5% of quarterly net income. Finally, a unique aspect of the research setting allows tests of who is responsible for the earnings management. Although firms appear unable to increase the frequency of aisle display promotions in the short run, they can reallocate these promotions within their portfolio of brands. Results show firms shifting display promotions away from smaller revenue brands toward larger ones following periods of poor financial performance. This indicates the behavior is determined by parties above brand managers in the firm. These findings are consistent with firms engaging in real earnings management and suggest that effects on subsequent reporting periods and competitor behavior are greater than previously documented.

We examine the break-even value for CCS adoptions, that is, the critical value in the charge for CO2 emissions that would justify investment in CCS capabilities. Our analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.S. jurisdictions, whereas in others a regulated utility provides integrated generation and distribution services. For either market structure, we find that emissions charges near $30 per tonne of CO2 would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively put an upper bound on the increase in electricity prices resulting from carbon regulations, and we estimate this bound to be near 30% at the retail level for both coal and natural gas plants. In contrast to the competitive power supply scenario, however, these price increases materialize only gradually for a regulated utility.

Anand, M. Faz\u0131l Pa\u00e7, Senthil Veeraraghavan Quality or quantity? An operator or cashier wants to provide ample, high-quality service to each customer to improve their satisfaction with the service provided. But, faced with a queue of customers, individual attention and increased service quality for one customer generally increases the waiting time for all of the others. In such customer-intensive services, the interaction between quality and speed is critical. If the service speed is chosen by the service provider, what is the optimal \u201cquality\u2013speed trade-off\u201d? A provider must define its service parameters based on service quality, delay costs, and price. The authors demonstrate that the customer intensity of the service is a critical driver of equilibrium price, service speed, demand, congestion in queues, and service provider revenues. They show that offering highly customer-intensive service allows the service provider to increase the number of competing servers and increase price, even as the service become slower. The insight for management: In highly customer-intensive service industries, offering longer service times might justify higher prices, even at the cost of longer customer waiting time.Privacy Regulation and Online Advertising (p. 57) Avi Goldfarb, Catherine E. Tucker Do you feel uncomfortable when you conduct an Internet search, and alongside search results come numerous banner advertisements for similar products or services that you searched for? Clearly, what you search for is being used as information; advertisers use online customer data to target their marketing and increase its effectiveness. However, such \u201cbig brother\u201d tactics have heightened consumers' privacy concerns. In the European Union (EU), privacy regulation has been passed that restricts advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. The authors study how EU privacy regulation has influenced advertising effectiveness by analyzing the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns. They find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where nondata-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features. The insight for management: Online target advertising based on user behavior is effective, but taken too far it might cause user or regulatory backlash that might reduce the effectiveness of online advertising. Privacy laws may reduce online advertising revenues as a result.An Investigation of Earnings Management Through Marketing Actions (p. 72) Craig J. Chapman, Thomas J.

They combine supermarket scanner data with firm-level financial data and find that soup manufacturers roughly double the frequency and change the mix of marketing promotions (price discounts, feature advertisements, and aisle displays) at the fiscal quarter-end when they have greater incentive to boost earnings.

Their results confirm managers' stated willingness to sacrifice long-term value in order to smooth earnings and their stated preference to use real actions to boost earnings to meet different types of earnings benchmarks. The insight for management: Meeting earnings estimates might placate investors but, in the case of storable goods, only at a real cost to longer-term profitability.Competing to Be Certain (But Wrong): Market Dynamics and Excessive Confidence in Judgment (p. 93) Joseph R.

The authors investigate how market competition contributes to the expression of overconfidence among those competing for influence. In experiments where advisors try to sell their advice, they find that market competition exacerbates the tendency to express excessive confidence. The insight for management: The tendency in a highly competitive information market is for service providers to overstate capabilities to create differentiation and make the sale.Opportunity Spaces in Innovation: Empirical Analysis of Large Samples of Ideas (p. 107) Laura J. Kornish, Karl T. Ulrich A common approach to innovation, parallel search, is to identify a large number of opportunities and then to select a subset for further development, with just a few coming to fruition. For example, a movie studio might consider numerous scripts, eliminating all but the one they choose to pursue. One potential weakness with parallel search is that it permits repetition: The same, or a similar, idea might be generated multiple times, because parallel exploration processes typically operate without information about the ideas that have already been identified. In the movie studio example, many scripts might have the same premise, resulting in wasted effort of studio executives evaluating the same idea multiple times. The authors analyze repetition in five opportunity data sets from online opportunities to classroom technologies comprising 1,368 opportunities and use that analysis to address three questions. (1) When many efforts to generate ideas are conducted in parallel, how likely are the resulting ideas to be redundant? Although there is some redundancy in the ideas generated by aggregating parallel efforts, the authors find that this redundancy is quite small in absolute terms in their data. (2) At the outside, how many opportunities might be generated if there were abundant time to generate them? The authors extrapolate how many unique ideas would result from an unbounded effort by an unlimited number of comparable idea generators and estimate that the total number of unique ideas is approximately one thousand for the most narrowly defined domain and more than two thousand for the more broadly defined opportunities being explored. (3) Are the unique ideas more valuable than those similar to many others? The authors find a positive relationship between the number of similar ideas and idea value: the ideas that are least similar to others are not generally the most valuable ones. The insight for management: Redundancy of ideas has value. When conducting a search for new ideas to pursue, cluster similar ideas first to reduce wasted effort from redundant evaluation efforts, and focus on the ideas with a common theme, which tend to generate the most value.Recruiting for Ideas: How Firms Exploit the Prior Inventions of New Hires (p. 129) Jasjit Singh, Ajay Agrawal Do hiring firms use new recruits' prior inventions? The authors evaluate more than 6,000 U.S. patents and find that firms do leverage recruits' prior inventions heavily. When firms recruit inventors, they acquire not only the use of their skills but also enhanced access to their stock of ideas. However, the authors point out that this does not necessarily reflect widespread \"learning by hiring.\" Often, a recruit's exploitation of her own prior ideas accounts for almost half of the above effect. Interestingly, although one might expect the new recruit's role to diminish rapidly as her tacit knowledge diffuses across the new firm, the authors indicate that the recruit's importance is persistent over time. The insight for management: New ideas can be rapidly gained (leaked) when key employees are recruited into (away from) an organization.Grammar-Based Integer Programming Models for Multiactivity Shift Scheduling (p. 151) Marie-Claude C\u00f4t\u00e9, Bernard Gendron, Louis-Martin Rousseau This paper presents a new implicit formulation for shift scheduling problems, using context-free grammars to model the rules for the composition of shifts. From the grammar, the authors generate an integer programming (IP) model having a linear programming relaxation equivalent to that of the classical set covering model. When solved by a state-of-the-art IP solver on problem instances with a small number of shifts, the approach yields comparable solution times to other approaches, but, with a large number of shifts, the proposed formulation shows superior performance and can model a wider variety of constraints. The insight for management: New formulation approaches can help with solution speeds for large-scale integer programming problems.Information Goods vs. Industrial Goods: Cost Structure and Competition (p. 164) Roy Jones, Haim Mendelson What is the natural market structure for information goods? The authors study markets for information goods and find that they differ significantly from markets for traditional industrial goods. Markets for information goods in which products are vertically differentiated lack the segmentation inherent in markets for industrial goods. As a result, at the extreme, an informational monopoly will offer only a single product. Competition leads to highly concentrated information-goods markets, with the leading firm behaving almost like a monopoly even with free entry and without network effects. The insight for management: The cost structure for informational products naturally drives markets to a highly concentrated, single-product outcome.Do Auctioneers Pick Optimal Reserve Prices? (p. 177) Andrew M. Davis, Elena Katok, Anthony M. Kwasnica Do auctioneers pick optimal reserve prices? The authors investigate how auctioneers set reserve prices in auctions. Assuming risk neutrality of the seller, the optimal reserve price should not depend on the number of participating bidders. In a set of controlled laboratory experiments, the authors find that seller behavior often deviates from the theoretical benchmarks. The authors propose three alternative explanations for our results: risk aversion, anticipated regret, and probability weighting. They find that the regret model provides a slightly more favorable fit overall. The insight for management: Regret minimization may cause reserve prices that deviate from expected value-maximizing levels and may cost sellers profits.Understanding the Two Components of Risk Attitudes: An Experimental Analysis (p. 193) Jianying Qiu, Eva-Maria Steiger Can an individual decision maker be risk seeking in one component of a decision and risk avoiding in another? Typically, a curved utility function is used to describe outcome preferences, but, if probability weighting of outcomes is uncorrelated with the utility of outcomes, this description may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of probability and preference weighting. The authors provide experimental evidence that although most individuals exhibit concave utility and convex probability weighting, the two components show no strong positive correlation. The insight for management: Expected utility theory may not adequately capture risk attitudes, and an explicit depiction of risk attitudes is required to capture this complexity.Ranking Intervals and Dominance Relations for Ratio-Based Efficiency Analysis (p. 200) Ahti Salo, Antti Punkka How can effective benchmarking be conducted when there are extreme outliers? For example, the largest or smallest member of the peer comparison group might be the most or least efficient with respect to its input/output ratios and can skew how the efficiency of other members of the comparison group is perceived. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an optimization method that allows benchmarking of \u201cdecision-making units\u201d (DMUs) such as bank branches, school districts, and fast food franchises based on their inputs consumed and outputs produced. However, DEA is subject to outlier data. The authors develop ratio-based efficiency analysis based on the DMUs' relative efficiencies. They develop ranking intervals, which indicate the best and worst efficiency rankings that a DMU can attain relative to other DMUs; dominance relations, which show what other DMUs a given DMU dominates in pairwise efficiency comparisons; and efficiency bounds, which show how much more efficient a given DMU can be relative to some other DMU or a subset of other DMUs. Unlike conventional efficiency scores, these results are insensitive to outlier DMUs. They also show how the DMUs' efficiency ratios relate to each other for all feasible weights, rather than the weights that imply the maximal efficiency of a DMU. The insight for management: Benchmarking can be somewhat subjective; this methodology allows for a range of input and output weighting to be tested and derives rankings that are less subject to the input data provided.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1300","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['privacy', 'regulation', 'emissions', 'sustainability']","The article discusses privacy regulation and carbon capture, which touch on ethical concerns and sustainability, but primarily focuses on operational impacts and economic analysis rather than social justice or critical theory.

Ho et al. (Ho, T.-H., S. Savin, C. Terwiesch. 2002. Managing demand and sales dynamics in new product diffusion under supply constraint. Management Sci.48(2) 187\u2013206) show that it is never optimal to refuse to satisfy any customers when the firm has inventory of the product. On the other hand, in a very similar model, Kumar and Swaminathan (Kumar, S., J. M. Swaminathan. 2003. Diffusion of innovations under supply constraints. Oper. Res.51(6) 866\u2013879) show that production constraints may in fact lead a firm to reject customers' orders even when the firm has the inventory to satisfy them (to slow down new product diffusion). We provide a counterexample to the results of Ho et al. (2002) and show that in their and Kumar and Swaminathan's (2003) models, it may be optimal to deny customers a product in inventory. We provide a generalization of both models that includes the ability to dynamically price the product (and also allows capacity and production costs to vary over time). We show that the unintuitive but optimal behavior of denying customers products that are in inventory disappears when the firm can dynamically set prices. This paper was accepted by Candace A.

In a two-period monopoly, we examine the strategic interaction between exogenous learning (EL) and seller-induced learning (SIL) and the firm's product release and pricing strategies. The familiar, direct effect of strong learning is to facilitate a higher price for informed customers. We point out its indirect effect of inducing a higher period 1 price for uninformed customers (by lowering their expected utility from learning). These two effects underlie three major results. First, a strong learning intensity does not always imply deferred release. Surprisingly, for medium unit costs, the firm releases late (early) when learning intensity is weak (strong). Second, SIL facilitates different product release strategies, depending on the unit cost level. Potential SIL investment facilitates early release for low or medium unit costs, but may facilitate deferred release for high unit costs. Lastly, when customers have heterogeneous prior valuation, the high-end customers may buy early at a lower price and the low-end customers may buy later at a higher price, contrary to the usual skim pricing with informed customers.

Consumers have the option of purchasing the product early, before its value has been learned, or delaying the purchase decision until a time at which valuation uncertainty has been resolved. Whereas individual consumer valuations are uncertain ex ante, the market size is uncertain to the firm. The firm may either commit to a single production run at a low unit cost prior to learning demand, or commit to a quick response strategy that allows additional production after learning additional demand information. We find that the value of quick response is generally lower with strategic (forward-looking) customers than with nonstrategic (myopic) customers in this setting. Indeed, it is possible for a quick response strategy to decrease the profit of the firm, though whether this occurs depends on various characteristics of the market; specifically, we identify conditions under which quick response increases profit (when prices are increasing, when dissatisfied consumers can return the product at a cost to the firm) and conditions under which quick response may decrease profit (when prices are constant or when consumer returns are not allowed).

The packer processes fed cattle to produce two beef products, program (premium) boxed beef and commodity boxed beef, in fixed proportions, but with downward substitution of the premium product for the commodity product. The packer can source input (fed cattle) from a contract market, where long-term contracts are signed in advance of the required delivery time, and from a spot market on the spot day. Contract prices are taken to be of a general window form, linear in the spot price but capped by upper and lower limits on realized contract price. Our analysis provides managerial insights on the interaction of window contract terms with processing options. We show that the packer benefits from a low correlation between the spot price and product market uncertainties, and this is independent of the form of the window contract. Although the expected revenues from processing increase in spot price variability, the overall impact on profitability depends on the parameters of the window contract. Using a calibration based on the report by the GIPSA (Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. 2007. GIPSA livestock and meat marketing study, vol. 3: Fed cattle and beef industries. Report, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC), this paper elucidates for the first time the value of long-term contracting as a complement to spot sourcing in the beef supply chain. Our comparative statics results provide some rules of thumb for the packer for the strategic management of the procurement portfolio. In particular, we show that higher variability (higher spot price variability, product market variability, and correlation) increases the profits of the packer, but decreases the reliance on the contract market relative to the spot market.

For description-based decisions, our results are fully consistent with prospect theory's empirical findings under risk. Furthermore, no significant differences are detected across contexts as regards utility and loss aversion. Whereas decision weights exhibit similar qualitative properties across contexts typically found under prospect theory, our data suggest that, for gains at least, the subjective treatment of uncertainty in experience-based and description-based decisions is significantly different. More specifically, we observe a less pronounced overweighting of small probabilities and a more pronounced underweighting of moderate and high probabilities for experience-based decisions.

Our general model considers risk aversion, portfolio constraints (e.g., no short positions), return predictability, and transaction costs. This problem is naturally formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Unfortunately, with nonzero transaction costs, the dimension of the state space is at least as large as the number of assets, and the problem is very difficult to solve with more than one or two assets. In this paper, we consider several easy-to-compute heuristic trading strategies that are based on optimizing simpler models. We complement these heuristics with upper bounds on the performance with an optimal trading strategy. These bounds are based on the dual approach developed in Brown et al. (Brown, D. B., J. E. Smith, P. Sun. 2009. Information relaxations and duality in stochastic dynamic programs. Oper. Res. 58(4) 785\u2013801). In this context, these bounds are given by considering an investor who has access to perfect information about future returns but is penalized for using this advance information. These heuristic strategies and bounds can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate these heuristics and bounds in numerical experiments with a risk-free asset and 3 or 10 risky assets. In many cases, the performance of the heuristic strategy is very close to the upper bound, indicating that the heuristic strategies are very nearly optimal.

Our model shows that the former dominates or is dominated by the latter, depending on whether the rate of dissipation of intellectual capital upon default is larger or smaller than a critical level, respectively. Using patent-based and research-and-development-based variables as proxies for intellectual capital, we find robust evidence that the relation between intellectual capital and leverage is positive.

Opportunity Cost and Entrepreneurial Strategy: Theory, and Evidence from the Information Security Industry","We analyze how entrepreneurial opportunity cost conditions performance. Departing from the common practice of using survival as a measure of entrepreneurial performance, we model both failure and cash-out (liquidity event) as conditioned by the same underlying process. High-opportunity-cost entrepreneurs prefer a shorter time to success, even if this also implies failing more quickly, whereas entrepreneurs with fewer outside alternatives will choose less aggressive strategies and, consequently, linger on longer. We formalize this intuition with a simple model. Using a novel data set of information security start-ups, we find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs are not only more likely to cash out more quickly but are also more likely to fail faster. Not only is survival a poor indicator of performance, but its use as one obscures the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics, entrepreneurial strategies, and outcomes.

How do these approaches affect the firm's product release and pricing strategies? When learning of product characteristics takes some time, a firm introducing a new product such as appliances or technology faces the trade-off between releasing early to an uninformed market and deferring release to a better-informed market. The author notes three key findings. First, a strong learning intensity does not always imply deferred release. Second, SIL facilitates different product release strategies, depending on the unit cost level. Potential SIL investment facilitates early release for low or medium unit costs but may facilitate deferred release for high unit costs. Third, when customers have heterogeneous prior valuation, the high-end customers may buy early at a lower price and the low-end customers may buy later at a higher price. The insight for management: Product introduction timing depends on product complexity, cost, and form of product learning.New Product Diffusion Decisions Under Supply Constraints (p. 1802) Wenjing Shen, Izak Duenyas, Roman Kapuscinski Would a supplier deny a customer a product that they have in stock? Previous research has delivered conflicting results. It has been shown that, intuitively, it is never optimal to refuse to satisfy any customers when the firm has inventory of the product. But it has also been shown that production constraints may in fact lead a firm to reject customers' orders even when the firm has the inventory to satisfy them to slow down new product diffusion. These authors find it may be optimal to deny customers a product in inventory, but only if dynamic pricing is not an option. The insight for management: The unintuitive but optimal behavior of denying customers products that are in inventory disappears when the firm can dynamically set prices.The Circulation of Ideas in Firms and Markets (p. 1813) Thomas Hellmann, Enrico Perotti Why do innovation-driven clusters such as Silicon Valley form, and how do they facilitate progress?

Firms can establish boundaries that guarantee safe circulation of internal ideas, but, because firms need to limit idea circulation, they may fail to achieve completion. Spin-offs allow firms to benefit from the market's strength at idea completion, whereas markets benefit from firms' strength at generating new ideas. The insight for management: Diverse organizational forms (such as internal ventures, spin-offs, and start-ups) naturally coexist and mutually reinforce each other.Demand Forecasting Behavior: System Neglect and Change Detection (p. 1827) Mirko Kremer, Brent Moritz, Enno Siemsen Information or noise? That's the question that forecasters regularly need to answer. In a laboratory, the authors analyze how individuals make forecasts based on time-series data. They find that forecasters regularly make these mistakes: Forecasters overreact to forecast errors in relatively stable environments but underreact to errors in relatively unstable environments. The insight for management: Surprisingly, forecasting performance loss due to such systematic judgment biases is larger in stable environments than in unstable environments.Cash-Out or Flameout! Opportunity Cost and Entrepreneurial Strategy: Theory, and Evidence from the Information Security Industry (p. 1844) Ashish Arora, Anand Nandkumar Is it enough to survive, or does a new venture need to thrive in order to be a success? Typically, venture survival is used as the measure of success in research. These authors use both entity failure and cash-out as indicators. Interestingly, high-opportunity-cost entrepreneurs prefer a shorter time to success, even if this also implies failing more quickly. Entrepreneurs with fewer outside alternatives will choose less aggressive strategies and, consequently, linger longer. Using a novel data set of information security start-ups, the authors find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs (other options) are not only more likely to cash out more quickly but are also more likely to fail faster. The insight for management: Not only is survival a poor indicator of performance, but its use as one obscures the relationship among entrepreneurial characteristics, entrepreneurial strategies, and outcomes.Intellectual Capital and Financing Decisions: Evidence from the U.S. Patent Data (p. 1861) Qiao Liu, Kit Pong Wong What are the distinct roles played by intellectual capital in corporate financing decisions? Whereas intellectual capital limits a firm's debt capacity because of its low liquidation value, it enhances a firm's debt capacity through its positive impact on earnings. Using data on patents and research and development, the authors show that which role dominates depends on whether the rate of dissipation of intellectual capital upon default is large. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in the level of a firm's intellectual capital is associated with an increase of 6.6% to 21.1% in its market leverage. The authors find this positive relation to be stronger for biotechnology firms. The insight for management: Financing decisions and intellectual capital are interwoven.Experienced vs. Described Uncertainty: Do We Need Two Prospect Theory Specifications? (p. 1879) Mohammed Abdellaoui, Olivier L'Haridon, Corina Paraschiv Prospect theory has been long well accepted as the best way to analyze decision making under risk. Generally, people evaluate an outcome relative to a reference point alternative, and often small probabilities are subjectively overweighted while higher probabilities tend to be underweighted. There is considerable debate as to whether decision makers behave differently when the probabilities are known (risk) and when they are not (uncertainty). Do decision makers behave differently when they are told the probabilities (description-based decisions) than they do when they learn the probabilities through experimentation themselves (experience-based decisions)? The authors observe a less pronounced overweighting of small probabilities and a more pronounced underweighting of moderate and high probabilities for experience-based decisions. On the contrary, for losses, no significant differences were observed in the evaluation of prospects across contexts. The insight for management: The two sources of information yield very similar decision making outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1455","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['feedback', 'performance', 'productivity']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of performance and productivity without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

A Comparative Analysis of Litigation and Online Reputation as Quality Assurance Mechanisms","Commerce depends on buyers and sellers fulfilling their contractual obligations; mechanisms inducing such performance are essential to well-functioning markets. Internet-enabled reputation mechanisms that collect and disseminate consumer feedback have emerged as prominent means for inducing seller performance in online and offline markets. This paper compares the ability of reputation and more traditional litigation-like mechanisms for dispute resolution to induce efficient economic outcomes. We use a game-theoretic formulation and derive results for their relative efficiency and effectiveness individually or as complements. We find that the popular view of reputation as an efficient and relatively costless way to induce seller effort under all circumstances is incorrect; reputation is less efficient than litigation in inducing any given level of effort. Thus, reputation improves efficiency only in settings where the high cost of litigation, insufficient damage levels, or low court accuracy induce suboptimal effort or cause market failure. When adverse selection is important, reputation helps reveal the true types of market participants, which may offset its higher cost of inducing effort. Finally, adding reputation to existing litigation mechanisms increases seller effort and may require adjusting damage awards to avoid inducing excessive effort that reduces economic efficiency.

Firms face challenges in marketing such improving products to well-informed, forward-looking consumers who anticipate product improvements and seek to delay their purchase timing. Product design, specifically a modular upgradable architecture in which improving and stable subsystems of a product are separated and selectively upgraded, can be a valuable approach for marketers to alleviate consumer concerns about product obsolescence. However, such an architecture-based approach can present new challenges as well, and dealing with them requires carefully coordinated cross-functional decision making by the firm. In this paper, we identify and formalize the notion of design inconsistency, which refers to the monopolist firm's inability to commit to future product design architectures. We find that firms experience design inconsistency even when they are able to commit to future prices, and design inconsistency lowers firm profits as well as consumer surplus. We then derive a joint product architecture and pricing approach to solve this problem; this enables an innovating firm to optimally and in a time-consistent manner launch modular upgradable products. The modeling and analysis in the paper lends insight into types of markets and products for which modular upgradability is most appropriate and offers guidelines on making pricing and product design decisions jointly for managing sequential innovation.

More precisely, we propose a jump diffusion model for asset prices whose jump sizes have a mixed-exponential distribution, which is a weighted average of exponential distributions but with possibly negative weights. The new model extends existing models, such as hyperexponential and double-exponential jump diffusion models, because the mixed-exponential distribution can approximate any distribution as closely as possible, including the normal distribution and various heavy-tailed distributions. The mixed-exponential jump diffusion model can lead to analytical solutions for Laplace transforms of prices and sensitivity parameters for path-dependent options such as lookback and barrier options. The Laplace transforms can be inverted via the Euler inversion algorithm. Numerical experiments indicate that the formulae are easy to implement and accurate. The analytical solutions are made possible mainly because we solve a high-order integro-differential equation explicitly. A calibration example for SPY options shows that the model can provide a reasonable fit even for options with very short maturity, such as one day.

However, little is known about preference reversals under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). Subjects were asked to make a binary choice between ambiguous P-bets (big likelihood of giving small prize) and ambiguous $-bets (small likelihood of giving large prize) and their willingness to accept was elicited. Subjects then performed the same two tasks with risky bets, where the probability of winning for a given risky bet is the center of the probability interval of the corresponding ambiguous bet. Preference reversals are not only replicated under ambiguity but are even stronger than are those under risk. This is due to higher elicited prices for the $-bet and lower elicited prices for the P-bet under ambiguity than under risk. This result can be explained by the shape of the weighting function for different levels of uncertainty and for different elicitation modes.

One approach is to stimulate employees to engage in post-adoptive extended use, i.e., to learn and apply more of the available functions of the implemented technologies to support their work. Such learning behavior of extending functions in use is ingrained in a process by which users make sense of the technologies in the context of their work system. This study draws on sensemaking theory to develop a model to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of customer service employees' extended use of customer relationship management (CRM) technologies. The model is tested using multisource longitudinal data collected through a field study of one of the world's largest telecommunications service providers. Our results suggest that employees engage in post-adoptive sensemaking at two levels: technology and work system. We found that sensemaking at both of these levels impacts the extended use of CRM technologies. Employees' sensemaking at the technology level is influenced by employees' assessment of technology quality, whereas employees' sensemaking at the work system level is influenced by customers' assessment of service quality. Moreover, in the case of low technology quality and low service quality, specific mechanisms for employee feedback should be conceptualized and aligned at two levels: through employee participation at the technology level and through work system coordination at the work system level. Such alignment can mitigate the undesirable effect of low technology quality and low service quality, thereby facilitating extended use. Importantly, we found that extended use amplifies employees' service capacity, leading to better objective performance. Put together, our findings highlight the critical role of employees' sensemaking about the implemented technologies in promoting their extended use of IT and improving their work performance.

This \u201cfurther inspection proportion,\u201d affecting both security screening and the system congestion, becomes a key decision variable for the security-check system.

In the 1970s, Wick Skinner espoused the idea that the \u201cfocused factory will out-produce, undersell, and quickly gain competitive edge over the complex factory.\u201d In the case of health care, an example of such focus is Shouldice Hospital, a Canadian hospital that specializes in hernia operations. The authors evaluate the effect of focus on operational performance in the provision of health care through a study of more than 500,000 cardiac patients in California hospitals in 2007. They examine treatment focus at three distinct levels of the organization\u2014at the firm level, at the operating unit level, and at the process flow level. They find that focus at each of these levels is associated with improved outcomes, namely, faster service at higher levels of quality, as indicated by shorter stays and reduced mortality rates. However, specialized hospitals such as Shouldice might have \u201cefficient\u201d operations only because they cherry-pick the easier cases, such as hernias. After controlling for selective patient admissions, focused hospitals no longer demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in length of stay or mortality rate. However, at more granular measures of focus within the hospital (e.g., operating unit level), they find that more focus leads to a shorter stay, even after controlling for selective admission effects. The insight for management: Hospitals might begin specializing to create operating efficiency.Competing Matchmakers: An Experimental Analysis (p. 1913) Tanjim Hossain, Dylan Minor, John Morgan What do Microsoft Windows, the Nintendo Wii, Google, eBay, MasterCard, and the New York Stock Exchange have in common? They are all platforms. Platform competition is ubiquitous and has become increasingly important, but it is little understood. In some cases, multiple platforms coexist with stable market share; in others, a tipping point is reached and power shifts heavily, or entirely, to a single competitor. The authors use laboratory experiments to study platform competition. They find that when platforms are primarily vertically differentiated, even when platform coexistence is theoretically possible, markets inevitably tip to the more efficient platform. When platforms are primarily horizontally differentiated, so that there is no single efficient platform, the authors find strong evidence of equilibrium coexistence. The insight for management: Platforms are critical to competition and market structure for many products; the level of vertical and horizontal differentiation drives whether a competitive or monopolistic market results.Covenants in Venture Capital Contracts (p. 1926) Ola Bengtsson How do venture capitalists (VCs) structure arrangements with entrepreneurs? Through empirical analysis of mandatory legal filings, the author studies how covenants are included in contracts between VCs and entrepreneurs. Commonly included covenants are protective provisions such as limitations on taking on new debt, selling assets, executive pay, and business model changes. The author finds that contracts with higher fixed payoffs include 1.6 more covenants than do contracts with lower fixed payoffs. Similarly, venture capital (VC) contracts with no VC board majority requirement include 0.6 more covenants than do contracts that require a VC board majority. Covenants are also more common with older companies and when fewer VCs invest in a round. The insight for management: Venture capitalists use covenants to maintain control of entrepreneurial ventures.Cooperation Without Enforcement? A Comparative Analysis of Litigation and Online Reputation as Quality Assurance Mechanisms (p. 1944) Yannis Bakos, Chrysanthos Dellarocas When it comes to buyer and seller contractual adherence, is an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure? The authors compare market efficiency of markets with Internet-enabled reputation mechanisms with market efficiency of markets that use more litigation-like mechanisms for dispute resolution. They find that the popular view of reputation as an efficient and relatively costless way to induce seller effort under all circumstances is incorrect; reputation is less efficient than litigation in inducing any given level of effort. Thus, reputation improves efficiency only in settings where the high cost of litigation, insufficient damage levels, or low court accuracy induce suboptimal effort or cause market failure. The insight for management: Reputational effects alone are not enough; adding reputation to existing litigation mechanisms increases seller effort.Skill, Luck, and the Multiproduct Firm: Evidence from Hedge Funds (p. 1963) Rui J. P. de Figueiredo, Jr., Evan Rawley When managers require external investment to expand, higher-skilled firms will be more likely to diversify, even though less talented managers can exploit asymmetric information about their ability to raise capital from investors for personal rather than corporate gain. The authors examine more than 1,300 hedge funds from 1994 to 2006. They show that diversifying firms' excess returns are high relative to those of other firms prior to diversification and fall within firm after diversification, but are six basis points higher per month per unit of risk ex post compared to a matched sample of focused firms. The insight for management: Managers exploit asymmetric information about their own ability to time diversification decisions, but the discipline of markets ensures that better firms diversify, on average.Modeling Security-Check Queues (p. 1979) Zhe George Zhang, Hsing Paul Luh, Chia-Hung Wang When a country senses a threat to national security, travelers face the inconvenience of congested security checkpoints at international border crossing stations. Is there an effective security-check system that not only caters to the needs of nonrisk individuals but also sustains the efficiency of screening high-risk individuals? The authors investigate a security-check system with both security and customer service goals. In such a system, every customer has to be inspected by the first-stage inspector, but only a proportion of customers need to go through the second stage for further inspection. This \u201cfurther inspection proportion,\u201d affecting both security screening and system congestion, becomes a key decision variable for the security-check system. The authors show the optimal further inspection proportion can be determined to achieve the balance of the two goals and that the service capacities can be classified into \u201csecurity-favorable,\u201d \u201csecurity-unfavorable,\u201d or \u201csecurity-infeasible\u201d categories. The insight for management: Competing security and service objectives can be balanced with a smart approach to border crossing processing.Simple Economics of the Price-Setting Newsvendor Problem (p. 1996) Michael Salinger, Miguel Ampudia The Lerner relationship links the profit-maximizing price to marginal cost and the elasticity of demand. The authors generalize this relationship to the price-setting seller of a short-lived product (e.g., a newspaper) with uncertain demand. There are two ways to specify uncertainty: multiplicative and additive. Multiplicative uncertainty increases the optimal price because it increases the marginal cost of a unit sold and does not affect the markup factor. Additive uncertainty has no effect on the marginal cost of a unit sold and lowers the markup factor because it increases the elasticity of the average quantity sold with respect to price. The insight for management: Pricing is affected only under certain conditions of uncertainty.Stars and Misfits: Self-Employment and Labor Market Frictions (p. 1999) Thomas \u00c5stebro, Jing Chen, Peter Thompson Who ends up being their own boss\u2014stars of the market with high potential, or misfits who are hard-pressed to find traditional employment? Entrants into self-employment are disproportionately drawn from the tails of the earnings and ability distributions. Natural friction in the labor market creates mismatches between firms and workers and misassignment of workers to tasks. The authors use a Korean Labor and Income Panel Study data set to test their model. The insight for management: Prior work histories can be connected to the probability of entry into self-employment.Extracting Business Value from IT: A Sensemaking Perspective of Post-Adoptive Use (p. 2018) J. J. Po-An Hsieh, Arun Rai, Sean Xin Xu How can firms extract value from already-implemented information technologies (IT) that support the work processes of employees? One approach is to stimulate employees to learn and apply more of the available functions of the implemented technologies to support their work. Through study of the use of customer relationship management technologies at one of the world's largest telecommunications service providers, the authors find that such learning behavior of extending functions in use is ingrained in a process by which users make sense of the technologies in the context of their work system. The authors find that employees are more likely to figure it out in two ways: technology and work system. Employees' learning at the technology level is influenced by employees' assessment of technology quality, whereas employees' sensemaking at the work system level is influenced by customers' assessment of service quality. When technology is sub-par, employee feedback should be captured through employee participation at the technology level and through work system coordination at the work system level. Such alignment can mitigate the undesirable effect of low technology quality and low service quality, thereby facilitating extended use. The insight for management: The extended use of technology amplifies employees' service capacity, leading to better objective performance; understanding and aiding employees' sensemaking about the implemented technologies can promote their extended use of IT and improve their work performance.Integrated Product Architecture and Pricing for Managing Sequential Innovation (p. 2040) Vish Krishnan, Karthik Ramachandran Consumers know that smartphones get better and more affordable each year and that the patient consumer who waits to adopt the latest technology can benefit. Firms face challenges in marketing such improving products to well-informed, forward-looking consumers who anticipate product improvements and seek to delay their purchase timing. The authors find that modular upgradable architecture (\u201cUpdates available for download!\u201d), in which improving and stable subsystems of a product are separated and selectively upgraded, can be a valuable approach for marketers to alleviate consumer concerns about product obsolescence. However, such an architecture-based approach requires carefully coordinated cross-functional decision making by the firm. The authors find that \u201cdesign inconsistency\u201d\u2014the firm's inability to commit to future product design architectures\u2014lowers both firm profits and consumer well being when the firm cannot commit to future prices. The insight for management: A joint product architecture and pricing approach enables an innovating firm to optimally launch modular upgradable products in a time-consistent manner.Preference Reversals Under Ambiguity (p. 2054) Hela Maafi Preference reversals have been widely studied using risky or riskless gambles. However, little is known about preference reversals under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). In experiments, subjects were asked to make a binary choice between a bet with a large but unknown likelihood of a small prize and a bet with a small but unknown likelihood of giving a large prize. They then repeated the choice where the probability of winning for a given risky bet is known with the same expected outcome as the ambiguous bet. The author finds that preference reversals are not only replicated under ambiguity but are even stronger than are those under risk. The insight for management: Advances are being made in the understanding of decision making under risk and ambiguity.Option Pricing Under a Mixed-Exponential Jump Diffusion Model (p. 2067) Ning Cai, S. G. Kou The Black\u2013Scholes model created major advances in financial investing technology and strategy. The authors extend this model to include a more flexible distribution of jump diffusion, expanding its applicability, accuracy, and analytic tractability. The insight for management: Advances in financial research are expanding the applicability of the famous Black\u2013Scholes model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1477","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on operational performance in healthcare and venture capital contracts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Unraveling the Interaction of Financial and Operational Hedging","This paper investigates how firms manage risk by examining the relationship between financial and operational hedging using a sample of bank holding companies. Risk management theory holds that capital market imperfections make cash flow volatility costly. I investigate whether financial firms consider this cost or focus exclusively on managing tradable exposures. After documenting that acquisitions provide operational hedging by reducing potentially costly volatility, I find that postacquisition financial hedging declines even after controlling for the specific underlying risks. In addition, the decrease in financial hedging is related to the acquisition's level of operational hedging. Larger increases in operational hedging are followed by larger declines in financial hedging. These results indicate that firms in this sample manage aggregate risk, not just tradable exposures, and that operational hedging can substitute for financial hedging.

The firms face unique investment opportunities that arise in their business operations and can be undertaken at given reservation prices. The cash flows thus generated are not spanned by the securities traded in the financial market and cannot be valued uniquely. The intermediary purchases claims against these cash flows, pools them together, and sells tranches of primary or secondary securities to the investors. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which projects are undertaken due to the intermediary's actions, and firms are amenable to the pool proposed by the intermediary, compared to the no-investment option or the option of forming alternative pools. We also determine the structure of the new securities created by the intermediary and identify how it exploits the arbitrage opportunities available in the market. Our results have implications for valuation of real investments, synergies among them, and their financing mechanisms. We illustrate these implications using an example of inventory decisions under random demand.

We model a monopolist firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible versus dedicated) and capacity level under demand uncertainty. Differing from the majority of the stochastic capacity investment literature, we assume that the firm is budget constrained and can relax its budget constraint by borrowing from a creditor. The creditor offers technology-specific loan contracts to the firm, after which the firm makes its technology choice and subsequent decisions. Capital market imperfections impose financing frictions on the firm. Our analysis contributes to the capacity investment literature by extending the theory of stochastic capacity investment and flexible versus dedicated technology choice to understand the impact of capital market imperfections, and by analyzing the impact of demand uncertainty (variability and correlation) on the operational decisions and the performance of the firm under different capital market conditions. We demonstrate that the endogenous nature of credit terms in imperfect capital markets may modify or reverse conclusions concerning capacity investment and technology choice obtained under the perfect market assumption and we explain why. The theory developed in this paper suggests some rules of thumb for the strategic management of the capacity and technology choice in imperfect capital markets.

The Role of Governance","The resource-based view argues that acquisitions can build competitive advantage partially through retention of valuable human capital of the target firm. However, making commitments to retain and motivate successful top managers is a challenge when contracts are not enforceable.

We also show that the performance-retention link is stronger when the acquirer's governance provisions support managers and when the acquirer's CEO owns more equity.

Moreover, simple firms with large boards do not downsize adequately in response to the severe economic contraction: they invest more (or shrink less) and use more debt during the 1930s.

What are called nested echelon order-up-to policies are shown to be optimal for jointly managing inventory replenishments and secondary market sales. Under a general restriction on model parameters, we establish that it is optimal not to both sell off excess stock and replenish inventory. Secondary market sales complicate the structure of the system, so that the classical Clark and Scarf echelon reformulation no longer allows for the decomposition of the objective function under the optimal policy. We introduce a novel class of policies, referred to as the disposal saturation policies, and show that there exists a disposal saturation policy, determined recursively by a single base-stock level at each echelon, that achieves the decomposition of this problem. The resulting optimal replenishment policy is shown to be the echelon base-stock policy. We demonstrate the heuristic performance of this disposal saturation policy through a series of numerical studies: except at extreme ranges of model parameters, the policy provides a very good approximation to the optimal policy while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We also conduct numerical studies to determine the value of the secondary markets for multistage supply chains and assess its sensitivity to model parameters.

We relate Internet banking adoption to customer demand for banking services, the availability of alternative channels, customers' efficiency in service coproduction (\u201ccustomer efficiency\u201d), and local Internet banking penetration. We find that customers who have greater transaction demand and higher efficiency, and reside in areas with a greater density of online banking adopters, are faster to adopt online banking after controlling for time, regional, and individual characteristics. Consistent with prior work, we find that customers significantly increase their banking activity, acquire more products, and perform more transactions. These changes in behavior are not associated with short-run increases in customer profitability, but customers who adopt online banking have a lower propensity to leave the bank. Building on these observations we also find that the adoption drivers are linked to the postadoption changes in behavior or profitability. Customers who live in areas with a high branch density or high Internet banking penetration increase their product acquisition and transaction activity more than Internet banking adopters in other regions.

Whereas some of these links help users easily navigate the site, others are typically used to provide targeted recommendations based on the available user profile. When the user profile is not available (or is inadequate), the site cannot effectively target products, promotions, and advertisements. In those situations, the site can learn the profile of a user as the user traverses the site. Naturally, the faster the site can learn a user's profile, the sooner the site can benefit from personalization. We develop a technique that sites can use to learn the profile as quickly as possible. The technique identifies links for sites to make available that will lead to a more informative profile when the user chooses one of the offered links. Experiments conducted using our approach demonstrate that it enables learning the profiles markedly better after very few user interactions as compared to benchmark approaches. The approach effectively learns multiple attributes simultaneously, can learn well classes that have highly skewed priors, and remains quite effective even when the distribution of link profiles at a site is relatively homogeneous. The approach works particularly well when a user's traversal is influenced by the most recently visited pages on a site. Finally, we show that the approach is robust to noise in the estimates for the probability parameters needed for its implementation.

However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial implications of medical device recalls to understand if these consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls. The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period (2002\u20132005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.

We introduce a new measure of loss aversion for large payoffs, called the large-loss aversion degree (LLAD), and show that it is a critical determinant of the well-posedness of the model. The sensitivity of the CPT value function with respect to the stock allocation is then investigated, which, as a by-product, demonstrates that this function is neither concave nor convex. We finally derive optimal solutions explicitly for the cases in which the reference point is the risk-free return and those in which it is not (while the utility function is piecewise linear), and we employ these results to investigate comparative statics of optimal risky exposures with respect to the reference point, the LLAD, and the curvature of the probability weighting.

Of all the probabilities that a given model might have produced, those obtained by MLE yield maximum in-sample betting return to a log utility investor. Recognition of this affinity between MLE and log utility begs the wider methodological question of whether different decision makers benefit in different degrees from different probabilities. Probabilities produced by MLE can be either too conservative or too bold relative to those found by maximizing utility under more risk-tolerant or risk-averse score functions. A very (not very) risk-averse user, who bets characteristically small (large) fractions of wealth based on a conservative forecast, is bound to make a rapidly (slowly) increasing bet as the forecast probability becomes progressively bolder or more distant from the market probability. The effect of this interaction between risk aversion and forecast is that a highly risk-averse user may need a much bolder forecast to obtain the same certainty equivalent as a more risk-tolerant investor. It follows more broadly that professional forecasters should anticipate how a client with given risk aversion expects to gain from any given forecast, or forecast revision, before committing resources toward making a better informed (but still honest) forecast.

We model a duopoly facing consumers who have heterogeneous tastes for the products and who must experience a product before knowing how well it matches with their preferences. The analysis yields several key insights. Restocking fees not only can be sustained in a competitive environment, but also are more severe when consumers are less informed about product fit and when consumers place a greater importance on how well products' attributes fit with their preferences. We compare the competitive equilibrium prices to a scenario in which consumers are certain about their preferences and find conditions defining when consumer uncertainty results in higher equilibrium prices.

Channel stuffing allows a manager to report sales in excess of demand in order to influence investors' valuation of the firm. We apply an inventory model that highlights the potential role of inventory in the manager's channel stuffing and the investors' valuation strategies. Sales in our model are constrained by available inventory. Our model yields a semiseparating and semipooling equilibrium contingent on the initial inventory level: When the demand is lower than a threshold that depends on and is below the initial inventory level, the manager pads sales by a part of the excess inventory and releases the inflated sales report. The investors \u201ccorrect\u201d the reported sales and are able to infer perfectly the firm's value. When the demand reaches or exceeds this threshold, the manager pads any excess inventory to the sales and reports the initial inventory is sold out, which censors large demand realizations. Then the investors only infer the real demand is no less than the threshold and value the firm accordingly by expectation. Channel stuffing can influence the inventory decision, too. We find both over- and underinvestment in the initial inventory can arise in our model. We discuss empirical and managerial implications of our findings. This paper was accepted by Paul H.

A regular user might have profile information that helps him use the site more efficiently; for example, weather.com might have the zip codes he has previously queried, or Expedia might retain the last destination he wanted to fly to. These sites might also offer specials, discounts, and other links of interest that relate to his recent visits or profile options. But if the user is new to the site, it cannot effectively target products, promotions, and advertisements.

Naturally, the faster the site can learn a user's profile, the sooner the site can benefit from personalization. The authors develop a technique that sites can use to learn the profile as quickly as possible.

Dahl Who Moved My Cheese? by Dr. Spencer Johnson addresses the psychological elements of change management in organizations; people generally resist change because they are afraid of change. But rarely have researchers considered or quantified this cost on an organizational level. Researchers have quantified the organizational cost of change such as employee attrition, and hiring and firing costs and training costs from loss of productivity as an organization changes direction. The author delves into the cost of change to the employees themselves: What human toll is there, then, in a changing, evolving organization? The author analyzes detailed data on stress-related medicine prescriptions for 92,860 employees working in 1,517 of the largest Danish organizations to analyze the relationship between organizational change and employee health. The findings suggest that the risk of receiving stress-related medication increases significantly for employees at organizations that undergo change and that, as the breadth and scope of the organizational tumult expand, so does the use of such stress-related medication. The insight for management: Radical organizational change has a real cost for your employees.The Impact of Founders' Professional-Education Background on the Adoption of Open Science by For-Profit Biotechnology Firms (p. 257) Waverly W. Ding This paper investigates the effect of founders' professional-education background on the adoption of an \u201copen science\u201d technology strategy, which allows a firm's research personnel to do basic science research and publish the results in academic journals. Using a sample of 512 young biotechnology firms, the author finds that firms with proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have a higher probability of adopting an open science policy. This Ph.D. influence on open policy is especially notable in crowded technological niches and in an institutional environment in which open science has yet to become the industry norm. The insight for management: Entrepreneurial founders' background is an important factor in new-venture open science strategy and research structure.Status, Quality, and Attention: What's in a (Missing) Name? (p. 274) Timothy S. Simcoe, Dave M. Waguespack John Grisham, James Patterson, Mary Higgins Clark, and Danielle Steel, among others, are all well-known authors whose works are regularly New York Times Best Sellers. But does nearly every book they write deserve to be a best seller based on the merits of the work, or are they best sellers predominantly because of the reputation of the authors? If the author's name were not on the cover, would the book be as well received? The authors of this article ask this question: How much are we influenced by an author's identity when evaluating the quality of his or her work? The authors find that in academic circles name-based signals can explain up to three-quarters of the difference in publication rates between high- and low-status authors. That is, well-known authors get the benefit of the doubt and are more likely to be accepted for publication than those who are less well known. Interestingly, when attention is scarce, or search costs are high, the reputation effect is more pronounced. So the broader the pool of potential authors, the more pronounced the reputation effect can be. Furthermore, the better the reputation one has, the more attention one's idea gets, which helps give the idea more credibility and momentum, resulting in a virtuous cycle driven by author reputation. The insight for management: Don't be overly swayed by reputation when evaluating the quality of new ideas.Determinants and Outcomes of Internet Banking Adoption (p. 291) Mei Xue, Lorin M. Hitt, Pei-yu Chen What factors drive the decision to adopt an Internet banking service and subsequent customer profitability? The authors examine the drivers of adoption of Internet banking and the linkages among adoption drivers and outcomes such as product acquisition, service activity, profitability, and customer loyalty. They relate Internet banking adoption to customer demand for banking services, the availability of alternative channels, customers' efficiency in service coproduction, and local Internet banking penetration. They find that customers who have greater transaction demand and higher efficiency and reside in areas with a greater density of online banking adopters are faster to adopt online banking. Consistent with prior research the authors find that online customers significantly increase their banking activity, acquire more products, and perform more transactions. These changes in behavior are not associated with short-run increases in customer profitability, but customers who adopt online banking have a lower propensity to leave the bank. Customers who live in areas with a high branch density or high Internet banking penetration increase their product acquisition and transaction activity more than Internet banking adopters in other regions. The insight for management: Efficient customers and those with high service demand show greater postadoption profitability.Economic Interpretation of Probabilities Estimated by Maximum Likelihood or Score (p. 308) D. J. Johnstone How are forecasting and risk aversion related? The author evaluates forecasting methodologies in the face of the user's risk aversion and finds that the two are related. Simply, a highly risk-averse forecast user may need a much bolder forecast to obtain the same certainty equivalent as a more risk-tolerant one. Probabilities produced by maximum likelihood estimation can be either too conservative or too bold relative to those found by maximizing utility under more risk-tolerant or risk-averse score functions. A very (not very) risk-averse user who bets characteristically small (large) fractions of wealth based on a conservative forecast is bound to make a rapidly (slowly) increasing bet as the forecast probability becomes progressively bolder or more distant from the market probability. The insight for management: Professional forecasters should anticipate how a client with given risk aversion expects to gain from any given forecast, or forecast revision, before committing resources toward making a better informed forecast.Portfolio Choice Under Cumulative Prospect Theory: An Analytical Treatment (p. 315) Xue Dong He, Xun Yu Zhou That \u201closses loom large\u201d is a basic tenet of understanding individuals' choices under uncertainty. The well-known cumulative prospect theory (CPT) holds that most people evaluate an outcome relative to a reference point; falling below that point can create more disutility than exceeding it by the same amount. People tend to evaluate options relative to a benchmark rather than according to a final wealth position. The authors extend CPT with a new measure of loss aversion for large payoffs, called the large-loss aversion degree (LLAD), and they show that the size of the loss relative to a benchmark is important for accurately describing and predicting behaviors. The insight for management: A better understanding of individuals' decision making under uncertainty helps to reveal the psychology and outcomes of investment and other decisions.Channel Stuffing with Short-Term Interest in Market Value (p. 332) Guoming Lai, Laurens Debo, Lin Nan Does desire to meet end-of-the quarter sales targets to placate investors and inflate the firm's short-term market value result in \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d? A channel stuffing manager ships excess inventory to the downstream channel, allowing him to report sales in excess of demand in order to influence investors' valuation of the firm. The authors' modeling shows that when demand is lower than a certain proportion of the initial inventory level, the manager will pad sales and release the inflated sales report. Interestingly, savvy investors are able to \u201ccorrect\u201d the reported sales and are able to accurately infer the firm's value. However, when the demand exceeds this proportion of inventory, the manager will report that the initial inventory is sold out. Then the investors infer only that the real demand is relatively high, and the short-term value of the firm can be artificially inflated. Interestingly, this result influences the inventory decision, too. The authors find that both over- and underinvestment in the initial inventory can arise in this situation. The insight for management: Short-term managerial focus can result in inflated sales claims and poor inventory decisions and in some cases will not generate the anticipated short-term boost in company valuation.Managing Consumer Returns in a Competitive Environment (p. 347) Jeffrey D. Shulman, Anne T. Coughlan, R. Canan Savaskan The day after Christmas is a nightmare for retailers, as hoards of shoppers descend upon them with merchandise to return. Between one-fifth and one-third of all returns are not due to defect, but simply because the product does not meet the needs of the consumer. In the United States, the annual value of product returns is $60 billion, with an additional $40 billion spent to manage the return process. As a result, retailers might charge a restocking fee to defray these costs; for example, Best Buy charges 15% for returns of opened digital cameras, and the Apple Store charges 10% for opened iPods. The authors find that optimal restocking fees are more severe when consumers are less informed about product fit at the time of purchase. They further show that consumer uncertainty may result in higher equilibrium prices. Finally, they find a surprising result: Equilibrium restocking fees in a competitive environment can be higher than those charged by a monopolist. The insight for management: Retailers should promote gift cards. The inherent uncertainty of gift giving creates the inefficiency of high returns and the disincentive to purchase of higher prices and restocking fees. In product sales, firms should not use solely restocking fees as a way to defray product return costs.Cooperation in Games with Forgetfulness (p. 363) Raphael Thomadsen, Pradeep Bhardwaj Is it better to forgive and forget, or is revenge a dish best served cold? Which axiom holds in cooperative behavior situations? Companies and managers are apt to forget information; however, classic game theory analysis has assumed that all players have perfect recall. The authors examine how introducing forgetfulness into a multiplayer game-theoretic framework can help or hinder cooperative behavior. They find that forgetfulness impacts the ability of firms to cooperate in two different directions. On one hand, forgetfulness can diminish the ability to punish deviators, making cooperation more difficult; that is, to gain cooperation, it is in fact not better to forgive and forget. On the other hand, under some conditions forgetfulness can make meting out severe punishments more credible and decrease the ability for players to effectively deviate, facilitating cooperation even in circumstances where cooperation cannot be sustained under perfect recall; that is, members are less likely to deviate if they might forget that revenge is on the way. The insight for management: Perfect recall is not essential for the application of game theory to cooperative games, but more or less cooperative outcomes depend on what might be forgotten. In the presence of forgetfulness, more cooperation results if members do not forgive and forget and suffer unexpected revenge.Product Recalls in the Medical Device Industry: An Empirical Exploration of the Sources and Financial Consequences (p. 376) Sriram Thirumalai, Kingshuk K. Sinha The $90 billion market for medical devices is growing at 6% per year; medical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices; for example, there were nearly 5,000 product recalls over the 2002\u20132005 time frame. Surprisingly, based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over that four-year period, the authors find that, at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not as severe as one might expect. First, they find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls depends on the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. Second, they find that device recalls are more common among firms with a research and development focus on developing broader product portfolios. Finally, they find that the likelihood of recalls decreases after a company has undergone a recall. The insight for management: In the cutting-edge medical instrument industry, recalls on products are common and the market reaction is surprisingly mild. The smaller-stakes products tend to have lower financial repercussions from a recall, and firms that do more new product development are more prone to recalls.\u201cI Think You Think I Think You're Lying\u201d: The Interactive Epistemology of Trust in Social Networks (p. 393) Mihnea C. Moldoveanu, Joel A. C. Baum It is widely held that trust is essential in business relationships. The authors model trust as a state of knowledge or belief that is the result of the frequency and quality of communication in a large network. For instance, the telecommunications industry relies on chip makers like Intel that embed their chips into products. A system manufacturer with private information about a chip's limitations can cultivate Intel's trust by informing it of the limitations of the chip and of new market opportunities. The manufacturer can also undermine Intel's trust in software developers that target their applications to a chip's capabilities by communicating information that it privately knows. Thus, interaction intensity can be used to seed breaches of trust based on asymmetries of understanding. The insight for management: Trust is important to mobilization and coordination in a network and influences social capital arising from the network structure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1316","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['trust', 'communication', 'social networks']","The article discusses the importance of trust and communication in business relationships, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

What process, in other words, should organizers of status-based contests impose upon those who covet peer recognition? We propose a formal model of status-based competition that contrasts two competing alternatives. The first, following Merton, is the \u201cMatthew Effect,\u201d according to which a tournament's architect directs slack resources to elite actors and thus widens the distribution of rewards by favoring cumulative advantage. The second is the \u201cMark Effect,\u201d under which a tournament's designer instead pushes slack resources to marginal actors and thus tightens the distribution of rewards. Our results suggest that although the Mark Effect is better for the social welfare of most tournaments, the Matthew Effect is preferable in two distinct contexts: in small tournaments where variation in underlying ability translates into acute advantages for the most capable contestants; and in large tournaments whose contestants face constant, rather than rising, marginal costs\u2014a condition we relate to contestants' perception of their work as intrinsically valuable. Our contributions are twofold: We find, counter to the thrust of Merton's work, that cumulative advantage is not invariably optimal for the functioning of status contests; and we identify circumstances in which the production of superstars is likely to make contests for status better off in aggregate.

These weighting functions capture risk attitudes, subjective beliefs, and ambiguity attitudes. Our method, called the midweight method, is based on a convenient way to obtain midpoints in the weighting function scale. It can be used both for risk (known probabilities) and for uncertainty (unknown probabilities). The resulting integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty is particularly useful for measuring ambiguity, i.e., the difference between uncertainty and risk. Compared to existing methods to measure weighting functions and attitudes toward uncertainty and ambiguity, our method is more efficient and can accommodate violations of expected utility under risk. An experiment demonstrates the tractability of our method, yielding plausible results such as ambiguity aversion for moderate and high likelihoods but ambiguity seeking for low likelihoods, as predicted by Ellsberg.

This can provide guidance for managerial issues such as customer valuation and predicting customers' future behavior, whether it is acquiring additional services, selectively dropping current services, or ending the relationship entirely. In this research, we develop a dynamic hidden Markov model to identify latent states that govern customers' affinity for the available services through which customers evolve. In addition, we incorporate and demonstrate the importance of separating two other sources of dynamics: portfolio inertia and service stickiness. We then examine the relationship between state membership and managerially relevant metrics, including customers' propensities for acquiring additional services or terminating the relationship, and customer lifetime value. Through a series of illustrative vignettes, we show that customers who have discarded a particular service may have an increased risk of canceling all services in the near future (as intuition would suggest) but also may be more prone to acquire more services, a provocative finding of interest to service providers. Our findings also emphasize the need to look beyond the previous period, as in much current research, and consider how customers have evolved over their entire relationship in order to predict their future actions.

To study the competition in PDT at the marketing level, we construct an oligopoly game with an external QoS requirement. We show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, and the equilibrium QoS exhibits a switching surface structure with respect to capacities. To study the competition in capacity at the strategic level, we construct a two-stage game in which the firms compete in terms of their capacities in stage 1 and in terms of PDT in stage 2. We show the existence of two different types of pure strategy equilibria and characterize them. This study provides the following insights: an index of time-based competitive advantage (ITCA) and the first-mover advantage determine the positions of the firms in time-based competition; either the well-known prisoner's dilemma or off-equilibrium behaviors due to different preferences for equilibria (when multiple equilibria exist) may lead the firms to overinvest in capacity, but no one may gain a competitive advantage; a uniform improvement in internal efficiency (i.e., a uniform capacity cost reduction) may harm everyone; quality differentiation (i.e., going beyond the QoS benchmark) plays a dual role in time-based competition, either helping a firm with a larger ITCA to compete more effectively, or helping a firm possibly with a smaller ITCA to preempt competitors and protect its market advantage.

However, product costs are the output of a cost reporting system, which itself is the outcome of heuristic design choices. In particular, because of informational limitations, when designing cost systems firms use simple rules of thumb to group resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to allocate the pooled costs to products. Using simulations, we examine how popular choices in costing system design influence the error in reported costs. Taking information needs into account, we offer alternative ways to translate the vague guidance in the literature to implementable methods. Specifically, we compare size-based rules for forming cost pools with more informationally demanding correlation-based rules and develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. In addition, our analysis suggests that significant gains can be made from using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the consumption pattern for the largest resource only, especially when combined with correlation-based rules to group resources. We vary properties of the underlying cost structure (such as the skewness in resource costs, the traceability of resources to products, the sharing of resources across products, and the variance in resource consumption patterns) to address the generalizability of our findings and to show when different heuristics might be preferred.

We argue that together, these relationships influence performance differences among new plant ventures of incumbents, diversifying entrants, and entrepreneurial (de novo) entrants. Using data on 47,915 new plant ventures in U.S. manufacturing, we find that incumbents and diversifying entrants establish significantly more productive new plants than de novo entrants, and that this advantage significantly increases with the importance of learning by doing in an industry (industry learning intensity).

For Cournot retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or at least one retailer's information is less accurate. A supply chain may become worse off when making its information more accurate or production diseconomy smaller, if such an improvement induces the firms in the rival supply chain to cease sharing information. For Bertrand retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or information is more accurate. Under Bertrand competition a manufacturer may be worse off by receiving information, which is never the case under Cournot competition.

Bradlow, Peter S. Fader AT&T, Fidelity, Verizon, Time Warner, and other multidimensional service providers want to know: How much is a multiproduct customer worth, and does that worth change over time? Such insights help service providers with customer valuation and prediction of customers' future behavior such as acquiring additional services, dropping some current services, or ending the relationship entirely. The authors identify two sources of dynamics: portfolio inertia and service stickiness. They show that customers who have discarded a particular service may have an increased risk of canceling all services in the near future but paradoxically also may be more prone to acquire more services in the future. The insight for management: Customers who actively change their product and service portfolios are a key market segment for target marketing both for retention and for increased service offerings.A New Goodness-of-Fit Test for Event Forecasting and Its Application to Credit Defaults (p. 487) Andreas Bl\u00f6chlinger, Markus Leippold The 2005 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision lamented the lack of test statistics for validating probabilities of default, which banks use to forecast credit default events. As past disruptions in the credit markets suggest, prediction models for forecasting credit defaults are at the basis of sound risk-management practice and credit pricing. Even if the inaccuracy is small, an inadequately calibrated prediction model may cause substantial losses. The authors develop a new, more powerful, and more accurate test for validating the performance of probability forecasts. The insight for management: Appropriate forecasting techniques can help improve performance and reduce risk such as credit default.Reference-Point Formation and Updating (p. 506) Manel Baucells, Martin Weber, Frank Welfens Decision makers with \u201creference-dependent preferences\u201d assess outcomes based not on their total value, but on their value relative to some previously attained value. This approach to assessing decision making is well accepted. But what if there are multiple previous references? Little is known about how decision makers form and update their reference points given a sequence of information. For example, if a shopper sees multiple prices over time, how is the final price perceived relative to all of the previous prices? Interestingly, these authors find in their financial experiments that the subjects' reference price is best described as a combination of the first and the last price of the time series, with intermediate prices receiving smaller weights. The insight for management: First and last impressions weigh far greater than intermediate information to decision makers.Evaluating Heuristics Used When Designing Product Costing Systems (p. 520) Ramji Balakrishnan, Stephen Hansen, Eva Labro What is the cost per unit? This seemingly innocuous and ubiquitous question in business is much tougher to answer than one might think and is critical to resource allocation decisions. Marginal and average costs, fixed and variable costs are not always obvious, and appropriate data are not always available, so managers use rules of thumb for allocating costs. In particular, because of informational limitations, when designing cost systems, firms use simple rules of thumb to group similar resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to allocate the pooled costs to products. The authors compare size-based rules for forming cost pools with more information-intense correlation-based rules and develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. They find that significant gains can be made from using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the consumption pattern for the largest resource only. The insight for management: The heuristics embedded in costing systems have a big impact on resource allocation; improved costing methodologies can result in improved allocation decisions.A Model of Probabilistic Choice Satisfying First-Order Stochastic Dominance (p. 542) Pavlo R. Blavatskyy How can the choice of a decision maker be predicted if the decision maker is inconsistent? If one choice clearly dominates the other, prediction is straightforward.

The author proposes a model that provides a better fit to experimental data than do existing models. The insight for management: A new choice model can be used to better predict probabilistic choices.New Plant Venture Performance Differences Among Incumbent, Diversifying, and Entrepreneurial Firms: The Impact of Industry Learning Intensity (p. 549) Natarajan Balasubramanian Which start-up environment is more conducive to firm productivity: existing firms, spinoffs of existing firms, or entrepreneurial entrants? The author suggests that firm experience prior to setting up a new venture influences the ability to learn from experience after start-up, and that this relationship is moderated by the importance of learning by doing within the new venture's industry. Using data on 47,915 new plant ventures in U.S. manufacturing, the author finds that incumbents and diversifying entrants establish significantly more productive new plants than entrepreneurial entrants and that this advantage significantly increases with the importance of learning by doing in an industry. Surprisingly, these productivity differences appear to be driven more by learning subsequent to plant start-up than by initial disparities in productivity. The insight for management: Pre-start-up experience adds to the process of post-start-up learning, and the industry learning environment plays an important role in whether entrepreneurial firms can achieve a competitive advantage over existing firms.Sharing Demand Information in Competing Supply Chains with Production Diseconomies (p. 566) Albert Y. Ha, Shilu Tong, Hongtao Zhang Is more shared information in the supply chain always better? It is generally believed that if a retailer shares information with a manufacturer, the entire supply chain is better off because of improved coordination and allocation of resources. The authors study the incentive for vertical information sharing in competing supply chains with production diseconomies of scale under various forms of competition. In each case that the authors examine, information sharing benefits the supply chain when the production diseconomy is large or competition is less intense. However, the authors find that, under one set of assumptions surrounding the form of competition, a manufacturer may be worse off by receiving information. The authors also find that, under some assumptions surrounding the form of competition, information sharing by retailers is beneficial depending on the relative accuracy of the information being shared. Finally, competitive reaction to information sharing might undermine the intended benefits. The insight for management: More information sharing will not always improve supply chain profitability.The Midweight Method to Measure Attitudes Toward Risk and Ambiguity (p. 582) Gijs van de Kuilen, Peter P. Wakker When predicting outcomes of decisions, how do models capture risk attitudes, subjective beliefs, and ambiguity attitudes? The authors propose a \u201cmidweight method\u201d based on a convenient way to obtain midpoints in the weighting function scale. The method can be used both for risk (known probabilities) and for uncertainty (unknown probabilities). The resulting integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty is particularly useful for measuring ambiguity, i.e., the difference between uncertainty and risk. The insight for management: A new and more tractable and efficient method to measure uncertainty and ambiguity attitudes yields plausible results for ambiguity aversion and seeking behaviors.Promised Delivery Time and Capacity Games in Time-Based Competition (p. 599) Weixin Shang, Liming Liu A firm wants to promise quick delivery to make the sale but has to guard against the risk of breaking that promise and reducing its quality of service. What is the interaction of promised delivery time and quality of service with respect to competitive behaviors? The authors investigate firms' competitive behaviors in industries where customers are sensitive to both promised delivery time and quality of service as measured by the on-time delivery rate. This study provides numerous insights. First, competing in such an environment may lead firms to overinvest in capacity, with none gaining a competitive advantage. Second, a uniform reduction in capacity cost across the board may harm everyone. Third, quality differentiation in terms of improved on-time delivery can help a firm to compete more effectively or to preempt competitors and protect a market advantage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1332","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['noncompete covenants', 'entrepreneurship', 'employment growth']","The article discusses noncompete covenants and their impact on entrepreneurship and employment growth, which touches on themes of economic opportunity but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity.

Individual partners, however, can ignore the effects of such an externality and invest suboptimally to the detriment of the alliance. This paper examines the relative effectiveness of outcome- and action-based contracts in providing the alliance partners with the incentives to invest appropriately. We develop a mathematical model in which a focal firm (e.g., Sony) contracts with two partners (e.g., McDonald's and Old Navy) when each of these partners is privately informed about the impact of the alliance on its demand. Our analysis evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of outcome- (or output-) and action-based (or input-based) contracts in settings with varying levels of the demand externality. We find that when there is either no externality or a relatively weak positive externality, there is a strict preference for output-based contracts; that preference, however, is reversed with a sufficiently strong positive externality.

This paper reports a laboratory experiment that investigates if actual bidders account for this trade-off, using a sequential procurement auction with private cost information and varying information revelation policies. Specifically, the Complete Information Revelation Policy, where all submitted bids are revealed between auctions, is compared to the Incomplete Information Revelation Policy, where only the winning bid is revealed. The experimental results are largely consistent with the theoretical predictions. For example, bidders pool with other types to prevent an opponent from learning significantly more often under a Complete Information Revelation Policy. Also as predicted, the procurer pays less when employing an Incomplete Information Revelation Policy only when the market is highly competitive. Bids are usually more aggressive than the risk-neutral quantitative prediction, which is broadly consistent with risk aversion.

A sequence of coils of sheet metal needs to be color coated in consecutive stages. Different coil geometries and changes of colors necessitate time-consuming setup work. In most coating stages one can choose between two parallel color tanks. This can either reduce the number of setups needed or enable setups concurrent with production. A production plan comprises the sequencing of coils and the scheduling of color tanks and setup work. The aim is to minimize the makespan for a given set of coils. We present an optimization model for this integrated sequencing and scheduling problem. A core component is a graph theoretical model for concurrent setup scheduling. It is instrumental for building a fast heuristic that is embedded into a genetic algorithm to solve the sequencing problem. The quality of our solutions is evaluated via an integer program based on a combinatorial relaxation, showing that our solutions are within 10% of the optimum.

We develop a model of such a system and compare its performance to three alternative systems: quick-response-only systems, enhanced-design-only systems, and traditional systems (which lack both enhanced design and quick response capabilities). In particular, we focus on the impact of each of the four systems on \u201cstrategic\u201d or forward-looking consumer purchasing behavior, i.e., the intentional delay in purchasing an item at the full price to obtain it during an end-of-season clearance. We find that enhanced design helps to mitigate strategic behavior by offering consumers a product they value more, making them less willing to risk waiting for a clearance sale and possibly experiencing a stockout. Quick response mitigates strategic behavior through a different mechanism: by better matching supply to demand, it reduces the chance of a clearance sale. Most importantly, we find that although it is possible for quick response and enhanced design to be either complements or substitutes, the complementarity effect tends to dominate. Hence, when both quick response and enhanced design are combined in a fast fashion system, the firm typically enjoys a greater incremental increase in profit than the sum of the increases resulting from employing either system in isolation. Furthermore, complementarity is strongest when customers are very strategic. We conclude that fast fashion systems can be of significant value, particularly when consumers exhibit strategic behavior.

We show that the interplay between a manager's incentives from her compensation structure and career concerns leads to a nonmonotonic (approximately U-shaped) relation between her risk choices and prior performance relative to her peers. Significantly outperforming (underperforming) managers are less (more) likely to be fired in the future and are also more likely to increase relative risk. Ceteris paribus, relative risk declines with the level of employment risk faced by a manager. Using a large sample of mutual fund managers, we find strong support for the hypothesized U-shaped relation between relative risk and prior performance. Our findings also highlight the importance of employment risk as the underlying driver of risk shifting by fund managers. Our theoretical model also generates additional hypotheses that link determinants of the fund flow\u2013performance relation and managers' employment risk to their risk-taking behavior. In support, our empirical analysis shows that funds with higher expense ratios have less convex fund flow\u2013performance relations and less convex U-shaped relations between relative risk and prior performance; funds with younger managers, who face greater employment risk, have more convex U-shaped relative risk\u2013prior performance relations; and managers in larger fund families have lower incentives to engage in risk shifting, thereby leading to a less convex U-shaped relation.

In this paper, we study a retail operations model where customers are strategic in both their actions and in the way they interpret information, whereas the retailer is strategic in the way it provides information. This paper focuses on the ability (or the lack thereof) to communicate unverifiable information and influence customers' actions. We develop a game-theoretic framework to study this type of communication and discuss the equilibrium language emerging between the retailer and its customers. We show that for a single retailer and homogeneous customer population setting, the equilibrium language that emerges carries no information. In this sense, a single retailer providing information on its own cannot create any credibility with the customers. We study how the results are impacted due to the heterogeneity of the customers. We provide conditions under which the firm may be able to influence the customer behavior. In particular, we show that the customers' willingness to pay and willingness to wait cannot be ranked in an opposite manner. However, even when the firm can influence each customer class separately, the effective demand is not impacted.

In this paper, we examine how a service plan affects the role played by a manufacturer's base warranty. Analysis shows that when consumers can assess product quality (i.e., the probability of product failure), the manufacturer's warranty is negatively affected by the presence of a service plan. In the presence of such a plan, a base warranty is offered only when the manufacturer is very cost-efficient in providing a warranty relative to the retailer. In this case, although the double-marginalization problem is aggravated, offering a (limited) base warranty reduces the total warranty cost in the channel and provokes the retailer into enlarging the service plan coverage. When consumers cannot assess product quality, a high-quality manufacturer is motivated to offer a base warranty to signal its quality. In the presence of a service plan, however, a very cost-efficient manufacturer is discouraged from doing so.

Established firms choose an investment timing and capacity level to maximize expected profits, whereas start-ups make those choices to maximize the probability of survival. When a start-up competes against an established firm, we find that when demand uncertainty is high and costs do not decline too severely over time, the start-up takes a leadership role and invests first in capacity, whereas the established firm follows; by contrast, when two established firms compete in an otherwise identical game, both firms invest late.

We show how downstream firms can still benefit from upward channel decentralization provided their product positioning is endogenous. Thus, we provide a new theory on the strategic benefits of upward channel decentralization.

The goal of this paper is to understand why simpler contracts may commonly be preferred in practice despite being theoretically suboptimal. We study a two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single buyer to characterize the impact of contract complexity and asymmetric information on performance and to compare theoretical predictions to actual behavior in human subject experiments. In the experiments, the computerized buyer faces a newsvendor setting and has better information on end-consumer demand than the human supplier. The supplier offers either a quantity discount contract (with two or three price blocks) or a price-only contract, contracts that are commonplace in practice, yet different in complexity. Results show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, quantity discounts do not necessarily increase the supplier's profits. We also observe a more equitable distribution of profits between the supplier and the buyer than what theory predicts. These observations can be described with three decision biases (the probabilistic choice bias, the reinforcement bias, and the memory bias) and can be modeled using the experience-weighted attraction learning model. Our results demonstrate that simpler contracts, such as a price-only contract or a quantity discount contract with a low number of price blocks, are sufficient for a supplier designing contracts under asymmetric demand information.

The authors study \u201csabotage\u201d\u2014the tendency to diminish coworkers' perceived performance in order to enhance one's own relative performance\u2014in a controlled laboratory experiment. They find that both productive work effort and destructive sabotage are higher for higher wage spreads. However, they find that sabotage does not grow as the total wages at risk grow, holding wage spreads constant, but, conversely, higher total wage pools do not reduce sabotage. Interestingly, in their experiment, simply by explicitly calling them by their name, \u201csabotage,\u201d such destructive activities are reduced. This is also the case with increased communication to reduce sabotage. The authors note that if sabotage is not possible, then wage differentials based on forced rankings are more often used by management. The insight for management: Ranking-based pay increases can inspire more effort, but some misguided efforts might be toward diminishing others' perceived output rather than increasing team output. Managers should be aware of and actively seek out such incentives, and they should communicate clearly that such destructive behaviors are not tolerable to derive the desired effects of merit-based pay increases.Fund Flows, Performance, Managerial Career Concerns, and Risk Taking (p. 628) Ping Hu, Jayant R. Kale, Marco Pagani, Ajay Subramanian What is the relation between a fund manager's career concerns and the risk level choices she makes in managing funds? Using a large sample of mutual fund managers, the authors find an approximately U-shaped relation between a manager's risk choices and prior performance relative to her peers. That is, significantly outperforming managers are less likely to be fired in the future, so they are likely to take on more relative risk, but, interestingly, underperforming managers are more likely to be fired in the future, so they also take on more risk. This relationship is more pronounced in younger fund managers. The relationship is less pronounced in large fund families and funds with higher expense ratios. The insight for management: Employment risk is a major underlying driver of fund risk tolerance by fund managers.Integrated Sequencing and Scheduling in Coil Coating (p. 647) Wiebke H\u00f6hn, Felix G. K\u00f6nig, Rolf H. M\u00f6hring, Marco E. L\u00fcbbecke Salzgitter Flachstahl GmbH, a major German steel producer, has implemented advanced optimization methodologies to their complex production planning problem in integrated steel production. A production plan comprises the sequencing of coils of different geometries and colors, but changes in size or color necessitate time-consuming and costly setup work. On the other hand, long production runs increase the average makespan (time to completion) of coils. In their production process, a sequence of coils of sheet metal needs to be coated with color in consecutive stages. In most coating stages one can choose between two parallel color tanks. This can either reduce the number of setups needed or enable setups concurrent with production. The authors developed an optimization model for this integrated sequencing and scheduling problem. This has led to an average reduction in makespan by more than 13% and has greatly exceeded expectations. The insight for management: Advanced optimization techniques can help planners reduce makespan while considering setup costs.An Experimental Study of Information Revelation Policies in Sequential Auctions (p. 667) Timothy N. Cason, Karthik N. Kannan, Ralph Siebert In traditional and online buyer auction markets, is it better to share all bidder information after an auction, or only reveal the winning bid information? Bidders have a desire to learn the content of competitors' bids, but they also have a vested interest in preventing an opponent from learning their bid information. The authors use an experimental setting to compare complete information with imperfect information policies. Although more information extraction might spur more competition, bidders also are inclined to submit a deceptively higher bid to prevent an opponent from learning more about their costs. The authors find that risk-averse behaviors in bidders drives lower purchase prices in markets with incomplete information in markets that are highly competitive. Interestingly, bidders bid lower than theory would predict in complete information markets, perhaps because of some desire to win clouding profit maximization behavior on the part of the bidders. The insight for management: Information sharing policies in auctions affect bidding strategies and procurement prices.Contract Complexity and Performance Under Asymmetric Demand Information: An Experimental Evaluation (p. 689) Basak Kalkanci, Kay-Yut Chen, Feryal Erhun Why are simple contracts that result in theoretically predicted suboptimal outcomes often preferred in practice? The authors use an experimental supply chain setting where the buyer has better information on customer behavior than the supplier. The supplier offers either a quantity discount contract (with two or three price blocks) or a price-only contract, contracts that are commonplace in practice yet different in complexity. The experimental results show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, quantity discounts do not necessarily increase the supplier's profits. Why do theory and practice differ? The authors identify three decision biases (probabilistic choice bias, reinforcement bias, and memory bias) that do not appear in theoretical models. As a result, they exhibit a bias toward decisions that they have already chosen and inertia that slows the movement to new decisions. The insight for management: In some market structures, simpler contracts are sufficient for a supplier designing contracts when decision biases are taken into account.Generating Ambiguity in the Laboratory (p. 705) Jack Stecher, Timothy Shields, John Dickhaut How does a decision maker's perception of probability and ambiguity affect their decisions? This article develops a method to provide researchers with a way to give subjects the experience of ambiguity. Probability-based decisions can be made via calculation of expected values; however, in the face of ambiguity, decision makers must make decisions with unknown probabilities\u2014a much harder proposition. Furthermore, it is difficult for researchers to emulate such uncertainty well, given that the researchers themselves know the actual probabilities, creating an asymmetry of information and obscuring experimental results. These authors create a method that eliminates the asymmetry of information and thus generates true ambiguity in an experimental setting. The insight for management: Ambiguous environments can now be better emulated, allowing researchers to contribute more to the study of ambiguous decisions.Buying from the Babbling Retailer? The Impact of Availability Information on Customer Behavior (p. 713) Gad Allon, Achal Bassamboo Expedia tells the user, \u201cOnly 2 seats left at this price!\u201d Is this an effective way to generate an immediate sale? Is the customer more likely to buy given this information? The consumer has to decide how to act on unbinding and unverifiable claims. The challenge for the retailer is what (if anything) to say and how to say it. The authors study retailers who are strategic in how they provide such information, and customers are strategic in the way they interpret information and their resulting purchase decisions. Using a game-theoretic framework, they show that when customers are largely homogeneous, such claims in fact carry no actual information; the retailer cannot create any credibility with the customers. However, when customers' willingness to pay and willingness to \u201cwait and see\u201d vary, such claims can influence some consumers' behaviors; however, on net, the total effective demand is not impacted. The insight for management: Be careful using limited supply information tactics to entice a quick sale; credibility can be lost with little influence on behavior or net sales.How Does a Retailer's Service Plan Affect a Manufacturer's Warranty? (p. 727) Bo Jiang, Xubing Zhang Car dealers and electronics stores regularly offer extended warranties or service plans beyond what the manufacturer offers. Do such offers affect the manufacturer's warranty? Generally, a base warranty is offered when the manufacturer is very cost efficient in providing a warranty relative to the retailer. But the authors find that service plan offerings of retailers can cause reduced manufacturer's warranties. If the customer can assess the probability of product failure, the manufacturer is more likely to offer a limited base warranty and the retailer is provoked into enlarging the service plan coverage. On the other hand, when consumers cannot assess product quality, a high-quality manufacturer is motivated to offer a better base warranty to signal its quality. Interestingly, if the retailer offers a service plan, the manufacturer is discouraged from doing so. The insight for management: Manufacturers' warranties and retail service plans are often substitutes.The Benefits of Competitive Upward Channel Decentralization (p. 741) Yunchuan Liu, Rajeev K. Tyagi Make or buy? This classic decision affects all industries and has given rise to outsourcing, offshoring, and the title chief sourcing officer. Typically, decisions center on the cost and benefits when production is outsourced to lower-cost upstream suppliers. But what about outsourcing production to upstream suppliers who do not have any advantages on production costs? The authors show how downstream firms can still benefit from upward channel decentralization provided they can adjust their product positioning. The authors suggest that upstream outsourcing provides more incentives for downstream firms to engage in more product differentiation, allowing them to benefit from the resulting softening of price competition. The authors use similar logic to show a new benefit to manufacturers selling through downstream retailers rather than directly. Interestingly, this has negative implications for consumer welfare. The insight for management: Outsourcing production upstream in the supply chain might lead to greater product differentiation and lower price competition; benefits outside of cost savings alone should be considered.Comarketing Alliances: Should You Contract on Actions or Outcomes? (p. 752) Pavan Rao Chennamaneni, Ramarao Desiraju McDonald's and Disney regularly cross-promote products, and presumably both sides gain\u2014but do more people go to the movie because of a toy, or do more people get the Happy Meal because of the movie? McDonald's might be able to do more to promote moviegoing, but such a benefit to the alliance is discounted or ignored by McDonald's as it makes its decisions. The problem grows more complex as more partners, such as Coca-Cola, enter the alliance. More generally, how should comarketing contracts such as this one be structured to ensure that both partners invest appropriately in such promotions? One could construct a contract based on \u201ceffort\u201d put into the promotions such as ad dollars, or \u201coutcomes\u201d of the promotion such as the number of Happy Meals sold. The authors find that, when there is a relatively weak positive externality, outcome-based contracts are preferred, but, when the externality is strong, effort-based contracts are better. The insight for management: Comarketing alliance contract structure directly affects participation and the success of the effort.Capacity Investment Timing by Start-ups and Established Firms in New Markets (p. 763) Robert Swinney, G\u00e9rard P. Cachon, Serguei Netessine Does the capacity investment timing of established firms and start-ups in new markets differ? When choosing how much capacity to build or reserve with a supplier, the trade-off is clear: Too much capacity results in underutilized facilities or depressed prices, whereas too little capacity results in reduced sales and suboptimal profit and growth. The authors find that established firms tend to choose an investment timing and capacity level to maximize expected profits, whereas start-ups focus on maximizing the probability of survival. Surprisingly, the authors find that when a start-up competes against an established firm in the face of high market size uncertainty and slowly declining costs, the start-up takes a leadership role and invests first in capacity; two established firms would both invest later. The insight for management: The composition of start-ups and established firms significantly impacts the dynamics of competition involving start-ups.The Value of Fast Fashion: Quick Response, Enhanced Design, and Strategic Consumer Behavior (p. 778) G\u00e9rard P. Cachon, Robert Swinney Fashion apparel firms such as Zara and Benetton have increasingly embraced \u201cfast fashion\u201d retailing; an operating philosophy that includes \u201cquick response\u201d\u2014short production and distribution lead times to better match supply with uncertain demand, and \u201cenhanced design\u201d to support highly trendy fashion models. But some \u201cstrategic buyers\u201d are glad to wait to get yesterday's hot fashions at greatly reduced prices. Does fast fashion result in fast discounting? Which of these capabilities have the most impact on the strategic delay in purchasing in order to obtain the item later at a discount? The authors find that enhanced design helps to reduce customer deferral by offering consumers a product they value more and are less willing to risk missing out on. Quick response also reduces the clearance by better matching supply to demand, thereby reducing the chance of a clearance sale. Most importantly, the authors find that, when both quick response and enhanced design are combined in a fast fashion system, the firm typically enjoys a greater incremental increase in profit than the sum of either system in isolation. Finally, these strategies work best when customers are most strategic in their buying. The insight for management: Fast fashion systems can be of significant value, particularly when consumers exhibit strategic behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1347","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['sabotage', 'employee ranking', 'management', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of employee performance and management practices without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

A Comparative Analysis of Liability Policies in Network Environments","In recent years, vendor liability for software security vulnerabilities has been the center of an important debate in the software community and a topic gaining government attention in legislative committees and hearings. The importance of this question surrounding vendor security liability is amplified when one considers the increasing emergence of zero-day attacks where hackers take advantage of vulnerabilities before the software vendor has a chance to release protective patches. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of three software liability policies: vendor liability for damages, vendor liability for patching costs, and government imposed security standards. We find that vendor liability for losses is not effective in improving social welfare in the short run, while liability for patching costs can be effective if either patching costs are large and the likelihood of a zero-day attack is low, or patching costs are small and zero-day likelihood is high. In the long run, when the vendor can invest in reducing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities, loss liability is still ineffective when the zero-day attack probability is high but can increase both vendor investment in security and social welfare when zero-day attack likelihood is sufficiently low. When the zero-day attack probability is high, patch liability is ineffective if user patching costs are large, but partial patch liability can boost vendor investment and improve welfare when patching costs are small. In contrast, in an environment with low zero-day attack probability, full vendor patch liability can be optimal. Finally, comparing the effectiveness of the three liability policies under study, we find that government imposed standards on software security investment can be preferable to both patching and loss liability on the vendor, if zero-day attack likelihood is sufficiently low. However, if zero-day attacks are a common occurrence and patching costs are not too high, partial patch liability is the most effective policy.

A Field Experiment","Popularity information is usually thought to reinforce existing sales trends by encouraging customers to flock to mainstream products with broad appeal. We suggest a countervailing market force: popularity information may benefit niche products with narrow appeal disproportionately, because the same level of popularity implies higher quality for narrow-appeal products than for broad-appeal products.

We explore some potential reasons why this has happened. Our empirical analyses suggest that the anomaly's demise stems in part from an increase in the amount of capital invested by hedge funds into exploiting it, as measured by hedge fund assets under management and trading volume in extreme accrual firms. A decline in the size of the accrual mispricing signal, as measured by the magnitude of extreme decile accruals and the relative persistence of cash flows and accruals, may also play a (weaker) role.

A central concern in designing innovation contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases. Greater rivalry reduces the incentives of all competitors in a contest to exert effort and make investments. At the same time, adding competitors increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems, whereas the effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives. Thus, uncertainty and the nature of the problem should be explicitly considered in the design of innovation tournaments. We explore the implications of our findings for the theory and practice of innovation contests.

A Field Experiment (p. 828) Catherine Tucker, Juanjuan Zhang Does the bandwagon effect hold for niche products? Popularity information is usually thought to reinforce existing sales trends by encouraging customers to flock to mainstream products with broad appeal. The authors suggest that such popularity information may benefit niche products with narrow appeal even more. If \u201ceverybody\u201d is buying a product of narrow appeal, it must \u201creally\u201d be good, whereas lots of people buy a popular product just because it has wide appeal. Through a field experiment from a website that lists wedding service vendors, the authors find that niche vendors benefit from touting the \u201cvisitor count\u201d as measured by click-throughs. The authors propose that the visitor count is a better indicator of quality for niche products than for products of broad appeal. The insight for management: Items with narrow appeal benefit more from popularity information than items with broad appeal.Incentives and Problem Uncertainty in Innovation Contests: An Empirical Analysis (p. 843) Kevin J. Boudreau, Nicola Lacetera, Karim R. Lakhani How many contestants should be allowed in a competition that requires innovation? In 2006, the Internet movie rental company Netflix sponsored a $1 million competition challenging participants to develop a 10% improvement in its movie recommendation algorithm. Netflix encouraged wide participation and received entries from more than 5,000 competitors. InnoCentive.com is a website that posts regular competitions and regularly encourages wide participation. Of course, a multitude of competitors increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. However, widely held economic theory suggests that greater rivalry reduces the incentives of all competitors in a contest to exert effort and make investments. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, the authors show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry is less important for highly uncertain problems; in these competitions adding competitors systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. The implications for management: When it comes to competitions with challenging, uncertain problems, the more the merrier; adding competitors increases the chances of breakthrough solutions.Designing Multiperson Tournaments with Asymmetric Contestants: An Experimental Study (p. 864) Hua Chen, Sung H. Ham, Noah Lim Is the popularity of \u201cMarch Madness\u201d of the NCAA basketball tournament the result of the massive disparity in potential of the number 1 and number 16 seeds? In an experiment, the authors test whether the presence of \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201cunderdogs\u201d actually increases the effort expended in such competitions. The answer is yes; the authors find that both favorites and underdogs exert extra effort as a result of this disparity. They find that the social and psychological elements of such competitions give added incentives. For favorites, the psychological losses from losing carry a social stigma. For underdogs, winning gives them bragging rights. The insight for management: Equal starting points are not necessary to incentivize effort; in fact, the presence of underdogs and favorites actually increases effort.Overconfidence by Bayesian-Rational Agents (p. 884) Eric Van den Steen How sure are you? The author suggests that if someone is relatively overconfident about their estimates and predictions, they can make mistakes when presented with new and conflicting information. The more confident someone is about such uncertainties, the more they tend to overestimate the precision of these estimates. The intuition is slightly ironic: When adjusting predictions in the face of new information, the overconfident person will overweight both the information and its precision. The insight for management: Avoid overconfidence bias; such misguided thinking leads to decreased ability to adjust to and benefit from new information.Retail Channel Structure Impact on Strategic Engineering Product Design (p. 897) Nathan Williams, P. K. Kannan, Shapour Azarm How did the exclusive AT&T deal with Apple iPhone affect Apple's optimal new product design, in terms of engineering design specifications and profits? Will adding Verizon as a retail channel help Apple? The authors develop a strategic framework that enables them to evaluate both profit and product development implications. They find that, via a monopoly retailer, the design preferences of the price-insensitive customers are better represented. Opening up to multiple retailers exposes the product to a wider variety of customers, increasing overall customer welfare through more popular designs. Interestingly, the single-channel strategy leads to lower profits but a higher probability of success for the manufacturer. The insight for management: A single-retailer strategy reduces risk and design options but can hamper overall profitability and consumer welfare.Entry and Patenting in the Software Industry (p. 915) Iain M. Cockburn, Megan J. MacGarvie To what extent are firms kept out of a market by patents covering related technologies? Do patents held by potential entrants make it easier to enter markets?

A Comparative Analysis of Liability Policies in Network Environments (p. 934) Terrence August, Tunay I. Tunca Who should be responsible for software security? In recent years, vendor liability for software security vulnerabilities has been the center of an important debate in the software community and a topic gaining government attention in legislative committees and hearings. The importance of this question is amplified when one considers the increasing emergence of zero-day attacks where hackers take advantage of vulnerabilities before the software vendor has a chance to release protective patches. The authors compare the effectiveness of three software liability policies: vendor liability for damages, vendor liability for patching costs, and government-imposed security standards. The right choice depends on the cost of software patches and the probability of zero-day attack. The insight for management: There is no single most effective policy for software security policy; tailored solutions must be created based on cost of patches and the probability of a hacker attack.Monte Carlo Bounds for Game Options Including Convertible Bonds (p. 960) Christopher Beveridge, Mark Joshi What is a fair price for a convertible bond?

Of course, a dollar today is better than a dollar tomorrow. The same two options deferred on year are equivalently delayed, but if there is risk with either option, preference for each can be affected. The researchers evaluate the impact of time on risk preferences, and they report the results of an experimental study that examines how delayed resolution and payment of risky options influence individual choice. The authors find that subjects become more risk tolerant for delayed lotteries. The insight for management: To encourage participation in riskier options, defer payouts; the passage of time on payouts tends to create probabilistic optimism resulting in a higher risk tolerance for delayed lotteries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1372","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market anomalies and performance metrics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This study focuses on the retail industry and investigates how stores manage their product variety, contingent on the presence of competition and their actual distance from rivals. Using a unique data set that contains all Best Buy and Circuit City stores in the United States, the authors find that a store's product variety (i.e., number of stock-keeping units) increases if a rival store exists in its market but, in the presence of such competition, decreases when the rival store is collocated (within one mile of the focal store). Moreover, collocated rival stores tend to differentiate themselves by overlapping less in product range than do noncollocated rivals. This smaller and more differentiated product variety may be because of coordinated interactions between collocated stores. In summary, this paper presents evidence of both coordination and competition in retailers' use of product variety.

In addition, we provide evidence that performance rewards reduce a less capable agent's tendency to choose a more difficult task, whereas a highly capable agent's pattern of choices is unaffected by performance rewards.

Theories invoked to explain gender segregation across jobs traditionally rely on firm-specific human capital and expectations of future commitment to explain this phenomenon. These do not apply in this setting. Yet we find that the staffing firm is more likely to shortlist women for low-paid projects and less likely to do so for high-paid ones. These effects are due to women being considered for different projects than men, and associated at least partially to the level of competition within vacancies. Although client companies also exhibit some gender-sorting behavior in the later steps of the hiring process, they are more likely to prefer women and less likely to sort them into lower-paid projects.

To ensure abundant supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her forecast in a costless, nonbinding, and nonverifiable type of communication known as \u201ccheap talk.\u201d According to standard game theory, parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative\u2014the manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier does not use the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in controlled laboratory experiments that parties cooperate even in the absence of reputation-building mechanisms and complex contracts. We argue that the underlying reason for cooperation is trust and trustworthiness. The extant literature on forecast sharing and supply chain coordination implicitly assumes that supply chain members either absolutely trust each other and cooperate when sharing forecast information, or do not trust each other at all. Contrary to this all-or-nothing view, we determine that a continuum exists between these two extremes. In addition, we determine (i) when trust is important in forecast information sharing, (ii) how trust is affected by changes in the supply chain environment, and (iii) how trust affects related operational decisions. To explain and better understand the observed behavioral regularities, we also develop an analytical model of trust to incorporate both pecuniary and nonpecuniary incentives in the game-theoretic analysis of cheap-talk forecast communication. The model identifies and quantifies how trust and trustworthiness induce effective cheap-talk forecast sharing under the wholesale price contract. We also determine the impact of repeated interactions and information feedback on trust and cooperation in forecast sharing. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our results for developing effective forecast management policies.

The preorder option enables the seller to sell a product at an early stage when consumers are less certain about their valuations. We find that the optimal pricing strategy may be highly dependent on the amount of information available at preorder and that a small change in the latter may cause a dramatic change in the proportion of consumers who preorder under optimal pricing. Furthermore, the seller's optimal information strategy depends on a key measure, the normalized margin, which is the ratio between the expected profit margin and the standard deviation of consumer valuation. Although the seller may want to release some information or none, she should never release all information. Finally, under the optimal information and pricing strategy, the benefit of preorder is most pronounced when the normalized margin is in a medium range.

Demand is stochastic, and depending on how it evolves, sellers may change their prices at any time. This reflects the fact that firms constantly, and almost costlessly, change their prices, reacting to updates in their estimates of market demand, competitor prices, or inventory levels. In a setting with demand uncertainty, we show that there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium for a duopoly, in which all states sellers engage in Bertrand competition and the seller with the lower equilibrium reservation value sells a unit at a price equal to the competitor's equilibrium reservation value. This structure therefore extends the marginal-value concept of bid-price control, used in many revenue management implementations, to a competitive model. We give a closed-form solution to the equilibrium price paths for a duopoly and extend all the results to an n-firm oligopoly.

Using as a control group firms that voluntarily provided these fair values prior to the mandatory adoption of IAS 40, we find that mandatory adoption firms exhibit a larger decline in information asymmetry, as reflected in lower bid\u2013ask spreads. However, we also find that mandatory adoption firms continue to have higher information asymmetry than voluntary adoption firms, which appears partially attributable to the lower reliability of fair values reported by the mandatory adoption firms.

Ren, Ye Hu, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, Jerry Hausman Best Buy offers a \u201cPrice Match Guarantee\u201d to its customers, but this guarantee is put to test only if there is a nearby competitor such as Circuit City with the same product. The authors ask the question: Will a store change its level of product variety if there is a key competitor in its market area? Are variety and product overlap further affected if the competing store is collocated? The authors study a unique data set that contains all Best Buy and Circuit City stores in the United States and find that a store's product variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units increases if a rival store exists in its market but decreases when the rival store is collocated within one mile of the focal store. Moreover, collocated rival stores tend to differentiate themselves by overlapping less in product range than do noncollocated rivals. This smaller and more differentiated product variety may be because of coordinated interactions between collocated stores.

The authors conduct an experiment to test whether research and development (R&D) professionals follow this design principle. The authors find that the need of R&D professionals to prove their talent within their organization or their broader community drives them to implement design solutions that are unnecessarily difficult, resulting in a higher likelihood of project failure. The authors also show that, for the same reason, the most capable designers tend toward the most complex problems. The insight for management: Your best and brightest might be trying to prove their talents as much as complete their projects successfully; be wary of unnecessarily complicated design. Push for Einstein's ideal: \u201cEverything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201dOptimal Preorder Strategy with Endogenous Information Control (p. 1055) Leon Yang Chu, Hao Zhang The iPad tablet, the Droid smartphone, the video game Halo 3, and the seventh Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, all were heavily preordered. What might cause a consumer to order a product before its release, and how can sellers best integrate preorder and retail prices? The authors find that the optimal pricing strategy may be highly dependent on the amount of information available at preorder and the relative spreads of profit potential and customer valuation of the product. When the spread in profit potential is large, less information and a large discount at the preorder stage enable the seller to sell more at preorder, when consumers are less certain about their valuations. When consumer valuation spread is large, the seller should target high-end valuation customers through a limited information release and small discounts. Interestingly, the seller should never release all information. The insight for management: Information release and preorder pricing strategies depend on the relative spread of consumer perceptions and product profit level potential.Dynamic Price Competition with Fixed Capacities (p. 1078) Victor Mart\u00ednez-de-Alb\u00e9niz, Kalyan Talluri Revenue management in airlines, car rental companies, and hospitals is a well-known and widely utilized approach to pricing a fixed, ephemeral capacity. Most research has dealt with optimal pricing with respect to uncertain demand conditions. Here the authors study the effect of such pricing practices on the competitive structure of the market. Whether there are fewer competitors, such as in airlines, or more, such as in hotels, affects typical revenue management strategies by introducing interdependent pricing strategies. The insight for management: In markets with fewer competitors, optimal revenue management strategies might depend not only on one's own capacity and expected demands, but also on competitors' capacities, demand, and price response to same.Loss Aversion with a State-Dependent Reference Point (p. 1094) Enrico G. De Giorgi, Thierry Post Decision makers often evaluate alternative outcomes' gain or loss relative to some reference point. The authors investigate such reference-dependent choice when the outcome of the reference point is uncertain. For example, the investment performance of money managers is often measured relative to a risky benchmark portfolio such as the S&P 500 index rather than a fixed target return. Does the same loss aversion apply? The authors find that the optimal reference-dependent solution equals the optimal consumption solution (no loss aversion) if the reference point is selected fully endogenously. Given that loss aversion is widespread, the authors conclude that the reference point generally includes an important exogenously fixed component. Using historical U.S. investment benchmark data, they show that this model is consistent with diversification across bonds and stocks for a wide range of evaluation horizons despite the historically high-risk premium of stocks compared to bonds. The insight for management: Loss aversion behavior is relevant even in cases where the reference point is of uncertain value.Trust in Forecast Information Sharing (p. 1111) \u00d6zalp \u00d6zer, Yanchong Zheng, Kay-Yut Chen Information sharing is widely believed to improve supply chain efficiency, but this is true only if the information itself is to be believed. Customer forecasts provide great information for suppliers if they are accurate, but, if the forecasts are inflated, planning around them can be disastrous. As a well-known case in point, Cisco in 2001 had to write off $2.1 billion in excess inventory because of overly optimistic customer forecasts. Simply, if the forecast is costless, nonbinding, and nonverifiable, it is just \u201ccheap talk,\u201d and the buyer has an incentive to inflate its forecast. The authors observe in controlled laboratory experiments that parties do tend to provide more accurate information than previously thought because of trust that is built between the parties over time. The authors determine when trust is important in forecast information sharing, how trust is affected by changes in the supply chain environment, and how trust affects related operational decisions. The insight for management: If capacity cost expansion is low or product variability is low, simple \u201ccheap talk\u201d forecast sharing is relatively reliable because of trust factors, but, for highly variable demand and high-cost capacity expansion industries, more complex contracts are in order.Mandatory Fair Value Accounting and Information Asymmetry: Evidence from the European Real Estate Industry (p. 1138) Karl A. Muller, III, Edward J. Riedl, Thorsten Sellhorn With the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in more than 100 countries and the growing convergence of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with IFRS, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently considering making IFRS mandatory for U.S. public companies by 2015. The authors examine the effects of mandating the provision of fair-value information for long-lived tangible assets on firms' information asymmetry. They find that mandatory adoption firms exhibit a larger decline in information asymmetry, as reflected in lower bid\u2013ask spreads. However, they also find that mandatory adoption firms continue to have higher information asymmetry than voluntary adoption firms, which appears partially attributable to the lower reliability of fair values reported by the mandatory adoption firms.

In periods of overcrowding, an ED can request the emergency medical services (EMS) agency to divert incoming ambulances to neighboring hospitals, a phenomenon known as \u201cambulance diversion.\u201d The EMS agency may accept this request provided that at least one of the neighboring EDs is not on diversion. From an operations perspective, properly executed ambulance diversion should result in resource pooling and reduce the overcrowding and delays in a network of EDs. Recent evidence indicates, however, that this potential benefit is not always realized. In this paper, we provide one potential explanation for this discrepancy and suggest potential remedies. Using a queueing game between two EDs that aim to minimize their own waiting time, we find that decentralized decisions regarding diversion explain the lack of pooling benefits. Specifically, we find the existence of a defensive equilibrium, wherein each ED does not accept diverted ambulances from the other ED. This defensiveness results in a depooling of the network and, subsequently, in delays that are significantly higher than when a social planner coordinates diversion. The social optimum is itself difficult to characterize analytically and has limited practical appeal because it depends on problem parameters such as arrival rates and length of stay. Instead, we identify an alternative solution that does not require the exact knowledge of the parameters and may be used by the EMS agencies to coordinate diversion decisions when defensive diversion is present. We show that this solution is approximately optimal for the social planner's problem. Moreover, it is Pareto improving over the defensive equilibrium whereas the social optimum, in general, might not be.

The challenge of designing incentive mechanisms that simultaneously focus on customer acquisition and customer retention comes from the fact that customer acquisition and customer retention are usually separate but intertwined tasks that make providing proper incentives more difficult. The present study develops incentive mechanisms that simultaneously address acquisition and retention of customers with an emphasis on the interactions between them. The main focus of this study is to examine the impact of the negative effect of acquisition on retention, i.e., the spoiling effect, on firm performance under direct selling and delegation of customer acquisition. Our main finding is that the negative effect of acquisition on retention has a significant impact on acquisition and retention efforts and firm profit. In particular, when the customer acquisition and retention are independent, the firm's profit is higher under direct selling than under delegation; however, when acquisition spoils retention, interestingly, the firm's profit may be higher under delegation. Our analysis also finds that the spoiling effect not only reduces the optimal acquisition effort but may also reduce retention effort under both direct selling and delegation. Comparing the optimal efforts under direct selling and delegation, the acquisition effort is always lower under delegation regardless of the spoiling effect, but the retention effort may be higher under delegation with the spoiling effect. Furthermore, when the customer antagonism effect from price promotions is considered, our main results hold regarding the firm's preferences between direct selling and delegation, which demonstrates the robustness of our model.

Under the terms of the CAP, a participating bank receives contingent capital by issuing preferred shares to the Treasury combined with embedded options for both parties: The bank gets the option to redeem the shares or convert them to common equity, with conversion mandatory after seven years; the Treasury earns dividends on the preferred shares and gets warrants on the bank's common equity. We develop a contingent claims framework in which to estimate market values of these CAP securities. The interaction between the competing options held by the buyer and issuer of these securities creates a game between the two parties, and our approach captures this strategic element of the joint valuation problem and clarifies the incentives it creates. We apply our method to the 18 publicly held bank holding companies that participated in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the stress test) launched together with the CAP. On average, we estimate that compared to a market transaction, the CAP securities carry a net value of approximately 30% of the capital invested for a bank participating to the maximum extent allowed under the terms of the program. We also find that the net value varies widely across banks. We compare our estimates with abnormal stock price returns for the stress test banks at the time the terms of the CAP were announced; we find correlations between 0.78 and 0.85, depending on the precise choice of period and set of banks included. These results suggest that our valuation aligns with shareholder perception of the value of the program, prompting questions about industry reactions and the overall impact of the program.

We show that with observable contracts exclusive territories have two countervailing effects on manufacturers' incentives to sustain tacit collusion. First, granting local monopolies to retailers softens competition in a one-shot game. Hence, punishment profits are larger, thereby rendering deviation more profitable. Second, exclusive territories stifle deviation profits because retailers of competing brands adjust their prices to the wholesale contract offered by a deviant manufacturer, whereas intrabrand competition prevents such \u201cinstantaneous reaction.\u201d We show that the latter effect tends to dominate, thereby making exclusive territories a more suitable organizational mode to cooperate. These insights are robust to endogenous communication between manufacturers. We also consider retailers' service investments. Here, a novel effect emerges that softens the procollusive value of exclusive territories: Retailers of a deviant manufacturer increase investments, which renders deviation more profitable.

An important question: What is the value of these CAP securities? Based on the 18 publicly held bank holding companies that participated in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, the authors estimate that, compared to a market transaction, the CAP securities carry a net value of approximately 30% of the capital invested for a bank participating to the maximum extent allowed under the terms of the program.

Today, Microsoft has softened its position, allowing, for example, modifications to .Net software for use with Linux. Proprietary software companies benefit from intellectual capital rights, resulting in continued investment and improvement in code. However, open source has multitudes of possible user-developers to continue its enhancement. Does \u201cmixed source\u201d\u2014both proprietary and open code in combination\u2014capture the best of both worlds? When would a profit-maximizing software company engage in a hybrid model? The firm can leverage armies of potential coders but must make open modules available for others to use free of charge. The authors show that when the firm's modules are of high quality, the firm is more open under competitor open-source incompatibility than under compatibility, but the opposite is true if modules are of low quality. The authors also find that firms are more likely to open substitute, rather than complementary, modules to existing open-source projects. The insight for management: Open-source and proprietary software companies are exploring mixed-source forms of \u201ccoopetition\u201d in software markets.Market Timing with Option-Implied Distributions: A Forward-Looking Approach (p. 1231) Alexandros Kostakis, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, George Skiadopoulos Typical portfolio mix optimization gauges the risk of an asset by its historical valuation variance. The authors develop \u201crisk-adjusted implied distributions\u201d\u2014forward-looking estimates of asset valuation variance based on market option prices. They form optimal portfolios and evaluate their out-of-sample performance and find that the use of their risk estimate makes the investor better off than if she uses historical returns' distributions to calculate her optimal strategy. The insight for management: Historical risk is not an indicator of future risk; better asset allocation strategies can be devised by using future risk estimates from options markets.Exclusive Territories and Manufacturers' Collusion (p. 1250) Salvatore Piccolo, Markus Reisinger Does granting exclusive territory rights to franchises encourage tacit price collusion among manufacturers? Having exclusive territories might soften price pressures on retailers by limiting same-product sales in an area and, in the short run, increase profits. However, retailers might deviate from agreed-upon prices in order to increase retailer profits. If two competing manufacturers both follow exclusive territory rights strategies, are such exclusive territory assignments conducive for creating tacit price collusion between competing supply chains? The authors show that exclusive territories are a more suitable organizational mode for tacit price collusion; however, if the retailer offers substantial demand-enhancing services, it tends to undermine collusive opportunities. The insight for management: Dedicated territories can support tacit collusions in supply chains if retailers do not offer extensive demand-enhancing services.Modeling the Loss Distribution (p. 1267) Sudheer Chava, Catalina Stefanescu, Stuart Turnbull The predicted loss distribution is a basic input for calculating the loan loss reserves and the economic capital and for computing portfolio risk metrics such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall. For an individual asset such as a bond or loan, the loss distribution depends on the probability of default and on the recovery rate given default. The authors develop a new model based on the analysis of a default and recovery data set over the horizon 1980\u20132008. They show that the specification of the default model has a major impact on the predicted loss distribution but that the specification of the recovery model is less important. They find evidence that industry factors and regime dynamics affect the performance of default models, implying that the appropriate choice of default models for loss prediction will depend on the credit cycle and on portfolio characteristics.

But how does this make existing customers feel? Despite the synergies between acquisition and retention of customers, should the same organization conduct both acquisition and retention activities? Designing the appropriate incentives to do both may be difficult; efforts toward acquisition of new customers might spoil existing ones. The authors develop incentive mechanisms that simultaneously address acquisition and retention of customers with an emphasis on the interactions between them. The authors find that when customer acquisition and retention are independent pursuits, the firm's profit is higher under direct selling than under delegation; however, when acquisition spoils retention, the firm's profit may be higher under delegation. The insight for management: Despite synergies between the activities, responsibility for acquisition and retention should be combined only when new acquisition does not come at the cost of customer churn due to inattention or other existing customer ill will.Centralized vs. Decentralized Ambulance Diversion: A Network Perspective (p. 1300) Sarang Deo, Itai Gurvich One of the most important operational challenges faced by emergency departments (EDs) in the United States is patient overcrowding. In periods of overcrowding, an ED can ask the emergency medical services (EMS) agency to divert incoming ambulances to neighboring hospitals, a phenomenon known as \u201cambulance diversion.\u201d The EMS agency may accept this request provided that at least one of the neighboring EDs is not on diversion. From an operations perspective, properly executed ambulance diversion should result in resource pooling and reduce overcrowding and delays in a network of EDs. The authors explain that this potential benefit is not always realized because of decentralized diversion decisions. They show that in some cases EDs act \u201cdefensively\u201d and do not accept diverted ambulances from the other ED. The insight for management: Cooperation between emergency rooms might be more effective if centrally planned.Preference Reversals for Ambiguity Aversion (p. 1320) Stefan T. Trautmann, Ferdinand M. Vieider, Peter P. Wakker Research has shown that irrelevant details in problem framing reverse the decisions of otherwise rational agents. The authors find that preference reversals depend on ambiguity aversion, that is, the distaste for unknown probabilities of future outcomes. However, the reversals are not a function of context-dependent weightings of attributes. The insight for management: Measurements of ambiguity aversion that use willingness to pay are confounded by loss aversion and hence overestimate ambiguity aversion.Testing for Prudence and Skewness Seeking (p. 1334) Sebastian Ebert, Daniel Wiesen A prudent decision maker avoids downside risk and exercises precautionary savings in anticipation of negative outcomes.

Prudence\u2014or anticipatory saving\u2014might be used to offset the risk of negative outcomes. The authors test for prudence and skewness preference in a laboratory setting. The authors find that prudence is observed on the aggregate and individual level and that prudence does not boil down to skewness seeking. The insight for management: Risk-mitigating precautionary saving behaviors are different from other risk-avoidance behaviors and may be more commonly used than other risk strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1406","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial programs and market strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In contrast to the case of explicit incentive contracts, we find that when individuals' actions are driven by career incentives, an aggregate measure (e.g., group or team output) can sometimes alleviate moral hazard concerns and improve efficiency. Aggregation intermingles performance measures that may be differentially affected by skill and effort of many agents. When such entanglement increases the prospect that the external market will attribute an employee's effort-driven contribution to transferable skills, the employee exerts higher effort as a means of posturing to the market. The incentive benefit of aggregation is weighed against the incentive cost because of information loss. Information loss from aggregation can reduce the market's reliance on the measure and thus diminish agents' desire to undertake effort to influence the measure.

We argue that Group Buying allows a seller to gain from facilitating consumer social interaction, i.e., using a group discount to motivate informed customers to work as \u201csales agents\u201d to acquire less-informed customers through interpersonal information/knowledge sharing. We formally model such an information-sharing effect and examine if and when Group Buying is more profitable than (1) traditional individual-selling strategies, and (2) another popular social interaction scheme, Referral Rewards programs. We show that Group Buying dominates traditional individual-selling strategies when the information/knowledge gap between expert and novice consumers is neither too high nor too low (e.g., for products in the midstage of their life cycle) and when interpersonal information sharing is very efficient (e.g., in cultures that emphasize trust and group conformity, or when implemented through existing online social networks). We also show that, unlike Referral Rewards programs, Group Buying requires information sharing before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the scale of social interaction but also incurring a higher cost. As a result, Group Buying is optimal when interpersonal communication is very efficient or when the product valuation of the less-informed consumer segment is high.

The existing literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers' choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a unique data set from Amazon containing sales data and consumer review data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers' relative preferences for different product features and also how text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in sales.

The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration.

This paper investigates the Internet's \u201clong tail\u201d phenomenon. By analyzing data collected from a multichannel retailer, it provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels.

Instead, we find that consumers' usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internet's long tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet.

We begin by developing a career concern model where CEOs innovate to provide evidence of their ability.

We test these predictions on a panel of large publicly traded firms for the years from 1980 to 1994. We find a robust positive association between overconfidence and citation-weighted patent counts in both cross-sectional and fixed-effect models. This effect is larger in more competitive industries.

A relatively new and unique Internet-enabled selling strategy, Group Buying provides consumers a discounted group price if they achieve a required group size and coordinate their transaction time. The authors suggest that Group Buying allows a seller to gain from facilitating consumer social interaction, i.e., using a group discount to motivate informed customers to work as \u201csales agents\u201d to acquire less-informed customers through interpersonal information/knowledge sharing. Group Buying is more profitable than traditional individual-selling strategies when the information gap between expert and novice consumers is neither too high nor too low (e.g., for products in the midstage of their life cycle) and when interpersonal information sharing is very efficient. The authors also show that, unlike Referral Rewards programs, Group Buying requires information sharing before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the scale of social interaction but also incurring a higher cost.

Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best-selling products. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating the Internet's \u201clong tail\u201d phenomenon: Niche products have a rising proportion of total sales. The authors analyze data collected from a multichannel retailer and show that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels. The authors find that consumers' usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, is associated with an increase in the share of niche products. They conclude that this shift may partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. For example, why would listeners rely on Billboard's \u201ctop 40\u201d when they can sample thousands of songs almost costlessly? The insight for management: If these trends in technology persist, they portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales as niche products become less niche.Systemic Risk: What Defaults Are Telling Us (p. 1387) Kay Giesecke, Baeho Kim In diversified financial markets and economies, the probability of widespread independent defaults is low. However, the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis shows us that the interconnectedness of financial markets can lead to systemic risk. The authors develop dynamic measures of the systemic risk of the financial sector as a whole. They define systemic risk as the conditional probability of failure of a sufficiently large fraction of the total population of financial institutions. This definition recognizes that the cause of systemic distress is the correlated failure of institutions to meet obligations to creditors, customers, and trading partners. Their measures provide accurate out-of-sample forecasts of the term structure of systemic risk in the United States for the period from 1998 to 2009. The insight for management: Financial risk models should incorporate both individual institutional risk and systemic risk to buffer institutions against future uncertainties.A Generalized Measure of Riskiness (p. 1406) Turan G.

Many individuals' performance incentives are driven by a desire to shape external perceptions (and thus future pay). But smooth sailing gets less attention for the individual executive than does recovery from a tsunami. The authors find that when individuals' actions are driven by career incentives, an aggregate measure (e.g., group or team output) can sometimes alleviate moral hazard concerns and improve efficiency. The reason is this: Aggregation intermingles the contribution to performance of skill and effort. The entanglement increases the prospect that the market will attribute an employee's effort-driven contribution to transferable skills, so the employee exerts greater effort as a means of posturing to the market. Of course, the incentive benefit of aggregation must be weighed against the incentive cost because of information loss. Information loss from aggregation can reduce the market's reliance on the measure and thus diminish agents' desire to undertake effort to influence the measure. The insight for management: Individual measures of performance may be direct but may introduce some incentives for malfeasance that can be mitigated by aggregate measures.Hedging and Vertical Integration in Electricity Markets (p. 1438) Ren\u00e9 A\u00efd, Gilles Chemla, Arnaud Porchet, Nizar Touzi How do vertical integration and forward markets affect energy markets? Forward markets and vertical integration are two mechanisms commonly used for demand and spot price risk diversification, but what is their impact on prices, risk premia, and retail market shares? The authors illustrate how these two strategies affect the French electricity market. They find that forward hedging and vertical integration both reduce the retail price and increase retail market shares. On the other hand, vertical integration restores the symmetry between producers' and retailers' exposure to demand risk, whereas linear forward contracts do not. The insight for management: Both mechanisms reduce price and increase market share, but vertical integration is superior to forward hedging when retailers are highly risk averse.Risk-Neutral Models for Emission Allowance Prices and Option Valuation (p. 1453) Ren\u00e9 Carmona, Juri Hinz How should call options on futures contracts be priced on CO2 emissions allowances? The existence of mandatory emission trading schemes in Europe and the United States, and the increased liquidity of trading on futures contracts on CO2 emissions allowances, led naturally to the next step in the development of these markets: These futures contracts are now used as underliers for a vibrant derivative market. The authors develop a model for allowance futures prices and demonstrate its calibration to historical European data. The insight for management: Modeling approaches can help price call options written on futures contracts for CO2 emissions allowances.CEO Overconfidence and Innovation (p. 1469) Alberto Galasso, Timothy S. Simcoe Are the attitudes and beliefs of CEOs linked to their firms' innovative performance? CEOs often innovate to provide evidence of their ability. Overconfident CEOs, who underestimate the probability of failure, are more likely to pursue innovation. The authors examine CEO stock options exercised from publicly traded firms between 1980 and 1994 to study the relationship between a CEO's \u201crevealed beliefs\u201d about future performance and various measures of corporate innovation such as new patent creation. The authors show a positive association between overconfidence and citation-weighted patent counts. This effect is larger in more competitive industries. The insight for management: Overconfident CEOs are more likely to take their firms in a new technological direction.Deriving the Pricing Power of Product Features by Mining Consumer Reviews (p. 1485) Nikolay Archak, Anindya Ghose, Panagiotis G. Ipeirotis User reviews of products such as digital cameras proliferate on Amazon.com and other websites. Such user-generated product reviews serve as a valuable source of information for customers making product choices online. But how can this highly unstructured data be used efficiently to increase sales and profits? Of course, the \u201cnumber of stars\u201d and the number of reviews are indicators, but the information embedded in product reviews is much richer and more detailed. Clearly a review is subjective and multifaceted (picture quality, compactness, ease of use, etc.), and the textual content of product reviews is critical to subsequent consumer choices. The authors use text mining to incorporate review text from 15 months of reviews on digital cameras and camcorders on Amazon.com. Because free-form text is messy, the authors clustered rare textual opinions based on mutual information and used expert opinion on the review semantics. The authors predict product popularity based on quantification of the information provided in the textual reviews. The insight for management: Textual data can be used to learn consumers' preferences for different product features and can be used for predicting future changes in sales.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1423","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['social interaction', 'consumer', 'information sharing']","The article discusses Group Buying as a mechanism that leverages social interactions among consumers, but it primarily focuses on profitability and market dynamics rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

The present research shows that TSIs made in customers by account managers can also lead them to be concerned about internal opportunism by nontargets of the investments (e.g., information technology or finance specialists in their own teams). Furthermore, it shows that concern about internal opportunism leads account managers to engage in internal blocking of their own team members (i.e., restricting their access to customers and to customer information), which results in lower performance with customers. This phenomenon is a conundrum in that account managers interested in stronger performance with customers appear to block the very functional specialists who can help them attain better performance. This research also identifies two types of continuities (account manager\u2013customer continuity and specialist\u2013customer continuity) that moderate the relationship between TSIs and concern about internal opportunism. Building on the literature in economics and organization theory, our research suggests that cross-functional teams that are designed to bring different functional areas together are more complex to manage than previously believed.

Implications for R&D and Marketing","The budgets for research and development (R&D) and marketing should be determined by managers to attain product market advantages. However, in response to investor expectations for short-term stock returns, managers may modify these budgets myopically to avoid unexpected short-term earnings shortfalls, at the cost of long-term profitability. We propose that the past behavior of firm stock returns and volatility may create investor expectations of short-term financial performance, which drives managers to modify either R&D or marketing budgets or both. In the context of high-technology firms, a Bayesian vector autoregression model, supported by content analysis, shows that few firms exhibit high levels of managerial myopia by simultaneously cutting both R&D and marketing budgets; instead, firms display moderate myopic reactions, in the form of unanticipated decreases in R&D budgets but increased budgets for marketing functions.

In particular, we focus on examining how the mobile-phone-based content generation behavior of users relates to content usage behavior. The key objective is to analyze whether there is a positive or negative interdependence between the two activities. We use a unique panel data set that consists of individual-level mobile Internet usage data that encompass individual multimedia content generation and usage behavior. We combine this knowledge with data on user calling patterns, such as duration, frequency, and locations from where calls are placed, to construct their social network and to compute their geographical mobility. We build an individual-level simultaneous equation panel data model that controls for the different sources of endogeneity of the social network. We find that there is a negative and statistically significant temporal interdependence between content generation and usage. This finding implies that an increase in content usage in the previous period has a negative impact on content generation in the current period and vice versa. The marginal effect of this interdependence is stronger on content usage (up to 8.7%) than on content generation (up to 4.3%). The extent of geographical mobility of users has a positive effect on their mobile Internet activities. Users more frequently engage in content usage compared to content generation when they are traveling. In addition, the variance of user mobility has a stronger impact on their mobile Internet activities than does the mean. We also find that the social network has a strong positive effect on user behavior in the mobile Internet. These analyses unpack the mechanisms that stimulate user behavior on the mobile Internet.

Negotiators who are high in rapport tend to be more likely to reach an agreement and more satisfied with the outcome. Although rapport generally has been found to have positive effects in standard negotiation settings, we investigate the effects of rapport in impasse settings, where conflict between negotiators' core needs means that a successful deal can only be reached when one or both parties acts unethically or \u201cmisbehaves,\u201d for example, by lying to the negotiation partner. In a series of three experiments, we find that negotiators who have a high level of rapport are more likely to behave unethically than are negotiators who have a low level of rapport. We find this effect holds both when high rapport results from the way in which negotiations are conducted (face-to-face versus computer mediated) and also when rapport is established through a brief rapport-building exercise before negotiations begin. Finally, we find that the negative effects (unethical behavior)\u2014but not the positive effects (satisfaction with the negotiation, trust, and willingness to work in the future with the negotiation partner)\u2014of high rapport are reduced when negotiators are given a simple reminder before negotiations begin that one's actions can have long-term repercussions for one's reputation.

We examine the effectiveness of such a strategy in the presence of strategic consumers who anticipate the future prices of both the durable product and the contingent consumable. Under a lock-in strategy, the manufacturer has pricing power over the contingent consumable, which she can use to extract additional rents from higher valuation consumers, but such pricing power may also reduce consumers' willingness to pay for the durable because it subjects them to being held up with higher consumables prices in the future. Restricting our attention to linear pricing policies, we find that if the manufacturer can commit to shutting down production of her durable after an initial one-time sale, then competition from another consumable of an appropriately degraded level of quality can benefit the manufacturer by mitigating consumers' fears of being held up. On the other hand, when the manufacturer cannot commit to shutting down production of her durable, then her own output of additional durables gives her an incentive to keep consumables prices low, and competition in the consumables market is less beneficial.

We model consumer choice using the nested multinomial logit framework with two different hierarchical structures: a brand-primary model in which consumers choose a brand first, then a product type in the chosen brand, and a type-primary model in which consumers choose a product type first, then a brand within that product type. We consider a centralized regime that finds the optimal solution for the whole category and a decentralized regime that finds a competitive equilibrium between two brands. We find that optimal and competitive assortments and prices have quite distinctive properties across different models. Specifically, with the brand-primary model, both the optimal and the competitive assortments for each brand consist of the most popular product types from the brand. With the type-primary choice model, the optimal and the competitive assortments for each brand may not always consist of the most popular product types of the brand. Instead, the overall assortment in the category consists of a set of most popular product types. The price of a product under the centralized regime can be characterized by a sum of a markup that is constant across all products and brands, its procurement cost, and its marginal operational cost, implying a lower price for more popular products. The markup may be different for each brand and product type under the decentralized regime, implying a higher price for brands with a larger market share. These properties of the assortments and prices can be used as effective guidelines for managers to identify and price the best assortments and to rule out nonoptimal assortments. Our results suggest that to offer the right set of products and prices, category and/or brand managers should create an assortment planning process that is aligned with the hierarchical choice process consumers commonly follow to make purchasing decisions.

One distinctive feature of keyword auctions is that they enable advertisers to adjust their bids and rankings dynamically, and the payoffs are realized in real time. We capture this unique feature with a dynamic model and identify an equilibrium bidding strategy. We find that under certain conditions, advertisers may engage in cyclical bid adjustments, and equilibrium bidding prices may follow a cyclical pattern: price-escalating phases interrupted by price-collapsing phases, similar to an \u201cEdgeworth cycle\u201d in the context of dynamic price competitions. Such cyclical bidding patterns can take place in both first- and second-price auctions. We obtain two data sets containing detailed bidding records of all advertisers for a sample of keywords in two leading search engines. Our empirical framework, based on a Markov switching regression model, suggests the existence of such cyclical bidding strategies.

Maxwell, Beatrice Roussillon What does \u201corganic\u201d mean, exactly? Producers like to use labels to certify that a product meets some standard for quality, but often consumers are unsure of the exact standard that the label represents.

First, consumers are most suspicious of a label when a product with a bad reputation has it, so labels are often unpersuasive at showing that a seemingly bad product is actually good.

G\u00fcrhan K\u00f6k, Yi Xu How should a seller of a variety of products plan its assortment? On one hand, sellers want to \u201ccover the waterfront\u201d to make sure that they offer all of the varieties that consumers might want; on the other hand, variety is expensive to offer, and narrowly spaced options might serve only to cannibalize each other and potentially confuse the consumer. Varieties and SKUs have been proliferating over the last decade, growing by 50% to more than 47,000 times, but major retailers like Kroger's, Walgreens, and Walmart have recently reduced variety by 15%. These authors claim that the right variety depends heavily on the way that consumers make choices. The result is a limited number of premium and off-premium options that maximize profit. The insight for management: To offer the right set of products and prices, category and/or brand managers should create an assortment planning process that is aligned with the hierarchical choice process that consumers commonly follow to make purchasing decisions.The Labor Illusion: How Operational Transparency Increases Perceived Value (p. 1564) Ryan W. Buell, Michael I. Norton The longer people wait for websites to load or complete tasks, the less satisfied they become. Frustrated by the hourglass on the screen and infuriated by the slow progress bar, they ask, \u201cWhat could be taking so long?\u201d However, customers are more forgiving when they know the cause of the delay. For example, an online travel site might take some time to provide travel options. If, during the calculations, the site informs the user of the specific tasks it is undertaking, the consumer better understands the reason for\u2014and is subsequently more forgiving of\u2014the wait. The authors show that when websites engage in \u201coperational transparency\u201d by signaling that they are exerting effort, people actually prefer websites with longer waits to those that return instantaneous results\u2014even when those results are identical. The authors describe this as the labor illusion; when customers understand the service being provided, and are not simply waiting in ignorance, they are more forgiving of the time spent. The insight for management: Time and consumer assessment are subjective; providing information to your customer will improve perceptions, even if total service time is higher.The Threat from Within: Account Managers' Concern About Opportunism by Their Own Team Members (p. 1580) Brian R. Murtha, Goutam Challagalla, Ajay K. Kohli A good account manager at, say, IBM knows the customer's needs and how to get the right technical (database, networking, finance, etc.) resources assigned to any problems. The account manager has to manage the external risk of maintaining the customer relationship at the expense of the company. These authors suggest a second threat from within the team: opportunistic behavior of team members. For example, the account manager might suspect that the technical specialist is promoting a solution that is easiest for them, not best for the customer. The authors say that such a threat leads account managers to engage in internal blocking of their own team members\u2014that is, restricting their access to customers and to customer information\u2014which actually results in lower performance with customers. This phenomenon is a conundrum in that account managers interested in stronger performance with customers appear to block the very functional specialists who can help them attain better performance. The insight for management: Cross-functional teams that are designed to bring different functional areas together are more complex to manage than was previously believed.The Stock Market in the Driver's Seat! Implications for R&D and Marketing (p. 1594) Anindita Chakravarty, Rajdeep Grewal For a company in tough times, in order to avoid unexpected short-term earnings shortfalls and meet investor expectations for short-term stock returns, the first thing to be cut is often the budget for research and development (R&D). Does such behavior myopically focus on the short term, sacrificing long-term performance? The authors propose that the past behavior of firm stock returns and volatility may create investor expectations of short-term financial performance, which drives managers to cut R&D. The authors examine high-technology firms and show that firms display moderate myopic reactions, in the form of unanticipated decreases in R&D budgets. They also find that managers increased budgets for marketing functions. They find that the tendency to manage myopically increases as firm size decreases or industry concentration decreases. The insight for management: Firms tend to cut R&D and increase marketing in the face of tough times to meet investor expectations; instead they should avoid being overly myopic and sacrificing long-term performance.The Dark Side of Rapport: Agent Misbehavior Face-to-Face and Online (p. 1610) Sandy Jap, Diana C. Robertson, Ryan Hamilton If NFL players and team owners got along better, would that have shortened the 2011 lockout? It is common knowledge that a good rapport helps negotiators reach a fast and mutually agreeable conclusion. Although rapport generally has been found to have positive effects in standard negotiation settings, the authors investigate the effects of rapport in impasse settings, where conflict between negotiators' core needs means that a successful deal can be reached only when one or both parties acts unethically or \u201cmisbehaves,\u201d for example, by lying to the negotiation partner. The authors find that negotiators who have a high level of rapport are more likely to behave unethically than are negotiators who have a low level of rapport. The insight for management: Despite its several advantages, in certain situations rapport has a dark side, of which negotiators must be wary.Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design: A Randomized Trial of Peer Influence in Networks (p. 1623) Sinan Aral, Dylan Walker Twitter, Facebook, and other social network devices have a growing impact on the \u201cbuzz\u201d about a product. How can firms create word-of-mouth peer influence and social contagion by designing viral features into their products and marketing campaigns? The authors evaluate the features that help create social contagion in these networks by evaluating 1.4 million friends of 9,687 experimental users on Facebook.com. Firms can either use passive, \u201cbroadcast\u201d messages or hope for more active, personal referrals. Surprisingly, the authors find that the passive-broadcast viral features generate a 246% increase in peer influence and social contagion, whereas active-personalized viral features generate only a 98% increase. Although active-personalized viral messages are more effective in encouraging adoption per message and are correlated with more user engagement and sustained product use, passive-broadcast messaging is used more often, generating more total peer adoption in the network. The insight for management: Traditional broadcast-style messages might be more effective than the personal recommendations that \u201cviral\u201d marketers crave.Newspaper Reports and Consumer Choice: Evidence from the Do Not Call Registry (p. 1640) Khim-Yong Goh, Kai-Lung Hui, Ivan P. L. Png How effective are mass media? Despite annual expenditures on public relations exceeding $19.42 billion, U.S. businesses lack practical guidance about the effectiveness of publicity in mass media. The authors conducted a study on the impact of news reports on consumer sign-ups with the U.S. Do Not Call (DNC) Registry. They found robust evidence that news reports increased consumer registrations: Overall, a 1% increase in the number of news reports increased DNC registrations by 0.018%. The response was greater if a toll-free telephone or URL were given. The response was lower if the headline or main text of the story was longer. The bandwagon effect found support: The impact on registration was higher for reports that mentioned the number of other people registering. Finally, the impact of news reports on consumer registration was stronger in national than local newspapers and in politically neutral and Democrat than Republican newspapers. The insight for management: Publicity does drive consumer behavior; a short and punchy story in a neutral national news source drives best results.Durable Products, Time Inconsistency, and Lock-in (p. 1655) Stephen M. Gilbert, Sreelata Jonnalagedda Printers require ink, iPods require songs, and razors require blades. As long as cartridges, file formats, and blade refills don't fit competitors' offerings, gaining customer adoption of the durable good locks in customers for the complementary nondurable items. So manufacturers have incentive to give away the durable, and then price the consumable at a higher rate. But when customers recognize this strategy they become less willing to buy the durable item in the first place because of the risk of being locked in. Interestingly, allowing competition from another consumable of a slightly lower quality can benefit the manufacturer by mitigating consumers' fears of being held up. The insight for management: With savvy consumers, the sales and profits of durables can be increased by allowing the presence of a competitive consumables producer.An Empirical Analysis of User Content Generation and Usage Behavior on the Mobile Internet (p. 1671) Anindya Ghose, Sang Pil Han Rapid advances in mobile Internet technologies now allow consumers to interact, create, and share content based on physical location. Exploding data demand has prompted wireless providers like AT&T and Verizon to consider usage-based data pricing. As is already the case in many countries, content consumption (downloads such as music) and creation (uploads such as pictures) would be billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion. The authors evaluate how mobile-phone-based content generation behavior of users relates to content usage behavior. The authors find that there is a significant negative temporal interdependence between content generation and usage. This finding implies that an increase in content usage in the previous period has a negative impact on content generation in the current period. The marginal effect of this interdependence is stronger on content usage (up to 8.7%) than on content generation (up to 4.3%). Interestingly, the authors find that users more frequently engage in content usage compared to content generation when they are traveling. The insight for management: Effective pay-as-you-go data pricing might take advantage of clear patterns in content consumption and generation.Pooling, Access, and Countervailing Power in Channel Governance (p. 1692) George Hendrikse The Greenery BV is a produce cooperative and one of the leading companies in Europe in the fruit and vegetable sector. Its main activity is to provide a complete range of fruits and vegetables to supermarket chains in Europe, North America, and the Far East throughout the year. The Greenery has experienced numerous governance structure changes, including horizontal merger, forward integration, and the emergence of grower associations. Which cooperative governance structures result in efficient investments? The author examines three governance strategies: pooling efforts such as cooperatives to equitably share revenues among growers, countervailing negotiation arrangements of growers to negotiate a single price, and priority access guarantees to volumes of produce. The author finds that the presence of cooperatives allows a dual distribution channel for growers, improving their efficiency. The insight for management: Properly managed cooperatives benefit growers and tend to result in more efficient market outcomes.Cyclical Bid Adjustments in Search-Engine Advertising (p. 1703) Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang, Juan Feng Keyword advertising, or sponsored search, is one of the most successful advertising models on the Internet. One distinctive feature of keyword auctions is that they enable advertisers to adjust their bids and rankings dynamically, and the payoffs are realized in real time. The authors examined two data sets containing detailed bidding records of all advertisers for a sample of keywords in two leading search engines. They find that advertisers may engage in cyclical bid adjustments and that equilibrium bidding prices may follow a cyclical pattern: price-escalating phases interrupted by price-collapsing phases. The insight for management: Sponsored search pricing is dynamic and cyclical; the most affective bidding strategy takes advantage of the ebb and flow of pricing behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1436","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['corporate social responsibility', 'trust', 'consumer confusion', 'labeling']","The article discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR) and its impact on consumer behavior, indicating a moderate focus on ethical business practices and social trust.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing\u2013remanufacturing\u2013disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant. When manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are different, we develop a heuristic method for computing the near-optimal control policy that performs quite well as demonstrated numerically.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0298","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['remanufacturing', 'sustainability', 'inventory']","The article discusses remanufacturing and inventory management, which touches on sustainability but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0299","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['customer sensitivity', 'local knowledge', 'market characteristics']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and customer service metrics without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

An important factor in both is the inherent economies of scale. Therefore, we advance a unifying model covering both applications and study the associated contracting problem under information asymmetry. At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, \u201cthe originator,\u201d faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution. Hence, it is optimal among all possible contracts (in both settings) because of economies of scale and contractibility of realized demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0303","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing and contracting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates the existence of a monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0306","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity management and customer behavior without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The success of such programs depends on well-designed and executed trade-in policies as well as accurate prediction of return flow to support operational decisions. Motivated by a real problem facing a high-tech company, this paper develops methods to segment customers and forecast product returns based on return merchandise authorization information. Noisy, yet proven to be valuable, returned quantity signals are adjusted by taking product characteristics and customer heterogeneity into account, and the resulting forecast outperforms two benchmark strategies that represent the high-tech company's current practice and a widely adopted method in the literature, respectively. In addition, our methods can serve as tools for companies to uncover the root causes of return merchandise authorization discrepancy, monitor and analyze customer behavior, design segment-specific trade-in policies, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of trade-in programs on a continuous basis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0307","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['customer heterogeneity', 'trade-in programs', 'operational decisions']","The article focuses on operational decisions and customer segmentation in B2B markets, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed\u2014one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable demand signal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0308","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a profit-maximizing vendor and technical modeling approaches without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop a game-theoretic model where multiple manufacturers sell their products to consumers through a single retailer. We compare a model where the retailer selects the assortment in the category with a model where the retailer relies on a category captain for assortment decisions in return for a target category profit.

Furthermore, whereas the value of product flexibility always decreases in demand correlation, we show that the value of volume flexibility can increase or decrease in demand correlation depending on whether the products are strategic complements or substitutes. We further find that volume flexibility better combats aggregate demand uncertainty for the two products, whereas product flexibility is better at mitigating individual demand uncertainty for each product. Our results thus underscore the necessity of analyzing volume flexibility with more than one product and emphasize the contrast with product flexibility. Furthermore, we highlight the possible pitfalls of combining flexibilities: we show that although adding volume flexibility to product flexibility never hurts performance, adding product flexibility to volume flexibility is not always beneficial, even when such an addition is costless.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0311","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of volume and product flexibility in operations management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion\u2014raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are \u201cheavy\u201d users and others know they are \u201clight\u201d users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0315","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies related to service congestion without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes of diversity and inclusion.

If all common components are used for the production of the entire set of products, then the optimal variety level increases relative to the system with no commonality. However, if the common components are used by a subset of the final products, then the optimal variety level may decrease with commonality.

We study the effects of diversity in experience on a team's ability to respond to task changes by separately examining interpersonal team diversity (i.e., differences in experience across the entire team) and intrapersonal team diversity (i.e., whether individuals on the team are more or less specialized). We also examine whether team familiarity\u2014team members' prior experience working with one another\u2014helps teams to better manage challenges created by task changes and greater interpersonal team diversity. Using detailed project- and individual-level data from an Indian software services firm, we find that the interaction of task change with intrapersonal diversity is related to improved project performance, whereas the interaction of task change with interpersonal diversity is related to diminished performance. Additionally, the interaction of team familiarity with interpersonal diversity is related to improved project performance in some cases. Our results highlight a need for more nuanced approaches to leveraging experience in team management.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0321","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['diversity', 'team performance', 'interpersonal diversity', 'intrapersonal diversity']","The article discusses the impact of diversity on team performance, which aligns with themes of DEI in organizational contexts.

Consumers observe an imperfect private signal indicating which service facility may provide better service value as well as the queue lengths at the service facilities before making their choice. If more consumers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at that facility and indicate higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time. We characterize the equilibrium queue-joining behavior of arriving consumers and the extent of their learning from the queue information in the presence of such positive and negative externalities. We find that when the arrival rates are low, utility-maximizing rational consumers herd and join the longer queue, ignoring any contrary private information. We show that even when consumers treat queues as independently evolving, herd behavior persists with consumers joining longer queues above a threshold queue difference. However, if the consumers seek to minimize ex post regret when making their decisions, herd behavior may be dampened.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0322","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior in service queues and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In our setting, the product is a complex health insurance plan. The firm incurs substantial costs in serving the customers through its call center and in adjudicating the claims using its information systems. The firm sells either standard plans or in some instances allows customer groups to customize their plans by adding and modifying certain aspects in active collaboration with the firm. Such a collaboration process is akin to the firm cocreating products with its customers. This cocreation process should increase customers' familiarity with their coverage and improve the fit with their medical needs. Better fit and familiarity in turn, reduces customers' incentives to contact the call center for clarifications regarding the firm's product coverage. In particular, we show that customers with a customized plan call 21% less frequently than customers with a standard plan. Our results account for possible self-selection of customers to customized plans. We also show no difference in the claims adjudication cost between a standard and a customized plan exists. Overall, our results suggest customized plans may be operationally cheaper to serve than standard plans. Thus, our paper provides a link between a growing business concern (customer support cost via call centers) and a prevalent business strategy (product customization via cocreation).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1100.0325","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['customization', 'collaboration', 'customer service']","The article focuses on operational efficiency and cost reduction through product customization and does not emphasize social justice or ethical considerations.

A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a \u201cchain store\u201d) and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0326","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and pricing strategies without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For medical conditions requiring urgent attention, patients want quick access to a familiar physician. For such instances, it is important for clinics to have open slots that allow same-day (urgent) access. A major challenge when designing outpatient appointment systems is the difficulty of matching randomly arriving patients' booking requests with physicians' available slots in a manner that maximizes patients' satisfaction as well as clinics' revenues. What makes this problem difficult is that booking preferences are not tracked, may differ from one patient to another, and may change over time. This paper describes a framework for the design of the next generation of appointment systems that dynamically learn and update patients' preferences and use this information to improve booking decisions. Analytical results leading to a partial characterization of an optimal booking policy are presented. Examples show that heuristic decision rules, based on this characterization, perform well and reveal insights about trade-offs among a variety of performance metrics important to clinic managers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0332","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['patient preferences', 'satisfaction', 'access']","The article discusses patient preferences and satisfaction in appointment systems, which touches on the importance of equitable access to healthcare.

Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation of the quality level. Customers make product choices to maximize a linear utility function of price, quality level, and waiting cost. Resulting product demands are met through capacity investments in production processes, which are modeled as queuing systems. We consider two different types of production processes: product-focused, dedicated to the production of a single-product variant; and product-flexible, processing all product variants in the product line. Capacity investment and variable production costs are functions of the processed product's quality. We develop an integrated marketing-operations model that provides insights on the factors determining the right level of product variety to offer, the relative quality positioning of the products in the line, the resulting market coverage and segmentation, and the effects on production costs and congestion levels of the processes. We show that the statistical economies of scale resulting from the congestion phenomena in the production system impose limits on the optimal product variety. For product-focused processes the market size promotes a higher optimal product variety, whereas the per-unit capacity investment and customer waiting costs act as deterrents for higher product variety. For product-flexible processes optimal product variety also depends on the specific type of flexibility and the ratio of capacity investment to variable production costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0333","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production systems and capacity investments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0335","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading costs and production planning in the agricultural industry without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2011","13","4","Deming ZhouDeming Zhoudzhou@cuhk.edu.hkDepartment of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author, Lawrence C.

Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0334","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory management for perishable products without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of cross shipping, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to\u2014and withdrawal of fit cash from\u2014the Fed; and (ii) offering a custodial inventory program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models\u2014designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI\u2014that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed\u2014based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider\u2014helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the Value of Local Reuse for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0336","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['socially optimal', 'cash recirculation', 'cost saving']","The article discusses the management of cash inventory under new Federal Reserve policies, with a mention of a 'socially optimal mechanism.'

In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity\u2013output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1110.0337","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier diversification and market competition without addressing any social themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems.

Modeling the call center as an M/M/s + M queue with endogenized customer reactions to announcements, we analytically characterize performance measures for this model. The analysis allows us to explore the role announcing different percentiles of the waiting time distribution, i.e., announcement coverage, plays on subsequent performance in terms of balking and reneging. Through a numerical study, we explore when informing customers about delays is beneficial and what the optimal coverage should be in these announcements.

Nevertheless, in all but the storable case, sufficient structure can be discerned so that the optimal solution can be easily computed.

We show how to apply the new pathwise method to the first- and second-order Greeks and propose kernel estimators that require little analytical efforts and are very easy to implement. The numerical results show that our estimators work well for practical problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0844","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial risk management and does not address any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

For models in which the prices of the underlying assets are driven by Brownian motions, the performance of QMC methods is known to depend crucially on the construction of Brownian motions. This paper focuses on the impact of various constructions. Although the Brownian bridge (BB) construction often yields very good results, as Papageorgiou pointed out, there are financial derivatives for which the BB construction performs badly [Papageorgiou, A. 2002. The Brownian bridge does not offer a consistent advantage in quasi-Monte Carlo integration. J. Complexity18(1) 171\u2013186]. In this paper we first extend Papageorgiou's analysis to establish an equivalence principle: if the BB construction (or any other construction) is the preferred construction for a particular financial derivative, then for any other construction, there is another financial derivative for which the latter construction is the preferred one. In this sense, all methods of construction are equivalent and no method is consistently superior to others; it all depends on the particular financial derivative. We then show how to find a good construction for a particular class of financial derivatives. In practice, our strategy is to find a good construction for an \u201ceasy\u201d problem and then apply it to more complicated problems related to the easy one. This strategy is applied to the arithmetic Asian options (including Bermudan Asian options) based on the weighted average of the stock prices. We do this by studying a simpler problem, namely, the geometric Asian option, for which the best construction is easily available, and applying it to the arithmetic Asian option. Numerical experiments confirm the success of this strategy: whereas in QMC all the common methods (the standard method, BB, and principal component analysis) may lose their power in some situations, the new method behaves very well in all cases. Further large variance reduction can be achieved in combination with a control variate. The new method can be interpreted as a practical way of reducing the effective dimension for some class of functions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0853","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial engineering and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

This model arises in resource allocation problems that permit or require sequential allocation decisions in a probabilistic setting. One particular application is in obsolescence inventory management. In this paper, the adaptive SKP is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem for discrete random rewards. The paper also presents a heuristic that mixes adaptive and static policies to overcome the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d in the DP. The proposed heuristic is extended to problems with normally distributed random rewards. The heuristic can solve large problems quickly, and its solution always outperforms a static policy.

We show existence and derive closed-form expressions for the robust optimization Nash equilibrium solution for a game with an arbitrary number of players. This solution allows us to gain insight into the nature of robust asymmetric newsvendor competition. We show that the competitive solution in the presence of information asymmetry is an intuitive extension of the robust solution for the monopolistic newsvendor problem, which allows us to distill the impact of both competition and information asymmetry. In addition, we show that, contrary to the intuition, a competing newsvendor does not necessarily benefit from having better information about its own demand distribution than its competitor has.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0858","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition and optimization without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We describe the price evolution as a continuous stochastic process and we focus on commonly used processes suggested by the financial literature, such as the geometric Brownian motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It is well known that under variable purchase price, a price-dependent base-stock policy is optimal. Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we explicitly characterize the optimal base-stock level using a series of threshold prices. We show that the base-stock level is first increasing and then decreasing in the current purchase price. We provide a procedure for calculating the thresholds, which yields closed-form solutions when price follows a geometric Brownian motion and implicit solutions under the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck price model. In addition, our numerical study shows that the optimal policy performs much better than inventory policies that ignore future price evolution, because it tends to place larger orders when prices are expected to increase.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0862","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and stochastic processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2011","59","1","Elodie AdidaElodie Adidaelodie@uic.eduDepartment of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607Search for more papers by this author, Victor DeMiguelVictor DeMiguelavmiguel@london.eduDepartment of Management Science and Operations, London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United KingdomSearch for more papers by this author","Supply Chain Competition with Multiple Manufacturers and Retailers","We study competition in a supply chain where multiple manufacturers compete in quantities to supply a set of products to multiple risk-averse retailers who compete in quantities to satisfy the uncertain consumer demand. For the symmetric supply chain, we give closed-form expressions for the unique equilibrium. We find that, provided there is a sufficiently large number of manufacturers and retailers, the supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the aggregate utility in the decentralized and centralized chains) can be raised to 1 by inducing the right degree of retailer differentiation. Also, risk aversion results in triple marginalization: retailers require a strictly positive margin to distribute even when they are perfectly competitive, because otherwise they are unwilling to undertake the risk associated with the uncertainty in demand. For the asymmetric supply chain, we show how numerical optimization can be used to compute the equilibria, and we find that the supply chain efficiency may drop sharply with the asymmetry of either manufacturers or retailers. We also find that the introduction of asymmetric product assortment reduces the degree of competition among retailers and thus has an effect similar to that of reducing the number of retailers. We show that, unlike in the symmetric chain, the asymmetric chain efficiency depends on product differentiation and risk aversion because of the interaction between these features and the asymmetry of manufacturers and retailers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0863","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain competition and efficiency without addressing social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The ramp loss allows a maximum error of 2 for each training observation, while the hard margin loss calculates error by counting the number of training observations that are in the margin or misclassified outside of the margin. SVM with these loss functions is shown to be a consistent estimator when used with certain kernel functions. In computational studies with simulated and real-world data, SVM with the robust loss functions ignores outlier observations effectively, providing an advantage over SVM with the traditional hinge loss when using the linear kernel. Despite the fact that training SVM with the robust loss functions requires the solution of a quadratic mixed-integer program (QMIP) and is NP-hard, while traditional SVM requires only the solution of a continuous quadratic program (QP), we are able to find good solutions and prove optimality for instances with up to 500 observations. Solution methods are presented for the new formulations that improve computational performance over industry-standard integer programming solvers alone.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0854","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of support vector machines and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The value of a multiname derivative depends on the distribution of portfolio loss at multiple horizons. Intensity-based models of the loss point process that are specified without reference to the portfolio constituents determine this distribution in terms of few economically meaningful parameters and lead to computationally tractable derivatives valuation problems. However, these models are silent about the portfolio constituent risks. They cannot be used to address applications that are based on the relationship between portfolio and component risks, for example, constituent risk hedging. This paper develops a method that extends these models to the constituents. We use random thinning to decompose the portfolio intensity into a sum of constituent intensities. We show that a thinning process, which allocates the portfolio intensity to constituents, uniquely exists, and is a probabilistic model for the next-to-default. We derive a formula for the constituent default probability in terms of the thinning process and the portfolio intensity, and develop a semi-analytical transform approach to evaluate it. The formula leads to a calibration scheme for the thinning processes and an estimation scheme for constituent hedge sensitivities. An empirical analysis for September 2008 shows that the constituent hedges generated by our method outperform the hedges prescribed by the Gaussian copula model, which is widely used in practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0855","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial derivatives and risk modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We assume the controller can, at some cost, shift the processing rate among a finite set of alternatives, for example by adding or removing staff, increasing or reducing the number of shifts, or opening or closing production lines. The controller incurs a cost for capacity per unit time and a delay cost that reflects the opportunity cost of revenue waiting to be recognized or the customer service impacts of delaying delivery of orders. Furthermore, he incurs a cost per unit to reject orders or idle resources as necessary to keep the workload of waiting orders within a prescribed range. We introduce a practical restriction on this problem, called the \ud835\udcae-restricted Brownian control problem, and show how to model it via a structured linear program. We demonstrate that an optimal solution to the \ud835\udcae-restricted problem can be found among a special class of policies called deterministic nonoverlapping control band policies. These results exploit apparently new relationships between complementary dual solutions and relative value functions that allow us to obtain a lower bound on the average cost of any nonanticipating policy for the problem, even without the \ud835\udcae restriction. Under mild assumptions on the cost parameters, we show that our linear programming approach is asymptotically optimal for the unrestricted Brownian control problem in the sense that by appropriately selecting the \ud835\udcae-restricted problem, we can ensure its solution is within an arbitrary finite tolerance of a lower bound on the average cost of any nonanticipating policy for the unrestricted Brownian control problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0868","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity management in a build-to-order environment with no mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and use it to characterize the structure of the optimal policy. In contrast to systems with exogenous and deterministic production lead times, we show that the optimal production policy for each item is a state-dependent base-stock policy with the base-stock level nonincreasing in the inventory level of items that are downstream and nondecreasing in the inventory level of all other items. For inventory allocation, we show that the optimal policy is a multilevel state-dependent rationing policy with the rationing level for each demand class nonincreasing in the inventory level of all nonend items.

We also provide a theoretical analysis that studies the \u201cprice\u201d of irrevocability, i.e., the performance loss incurred in imposing the constraint we propose on the multiarmed bandit model. We show that this performance loss is uniformly bounded for a general class of multiarmed bandit problems and indicate its dependence on various problem parameters.

The departure process is also approximated as a renewal process even though the autocorrelation of this process may significantly affect the performance of the subsequent queue depending on the traffic intensity. When the departure process is split into substreams by Markovian random routing, the split processes typically are modeled as independent renewal processes even though they are correlated with each other. This cross correlation might also have a serious impact on the queueing performance. In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling both the cross correlation and the autocorrelation by a three-moment four-parameter decomposition approximation of queueing networks. The arrival process is modeled as a nonrenewal process by a two-state Markov-modulated Poisson process, viz., MMPP(2). The cross correlation between randomly split streams is accounted for in the second and third moments of the merged process by the innovations method. The main contribution of the present research is that both the cross correlation and the autocorrelation can be modeled in parametric decomposition approximations of queueing networks by integrating the MMPP(2) approximation of the arrival/departure process and the innovations method.

We develop a periodic-review single-product inventory system with price-dependent customer demand. The product return in each period is random but can be actively controlled by the firm's acquisition effort. The firm aims to maximize its total discounted profit over a finite planning horizon by implementing optimal production, remanufacturing, product acquisition, and pricing strategies. We first show that with an exogenous selling price, the optimal production-remanufacturing-disposal policy is simple and characterized by three state-independent parameters. The optimal acquisition effort is decreasing in the aggregate inventory level of serviceable product and cores. Nevertheless, when pricing is an endogenous decision, we find that the optimal policy becomes much more complicated, and its control parameters are state dependent. The optimal selling price is decreasing, whereas the optimal acquisition effort is increasing in the serviceable product inventory level, and both decisions decrease with the aggregate inventory level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0898","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product acquisition and inventory management without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We provide a precise characterization of the profit relationship in terms of (1) the number of firms, (2) their relative quality and cost differences, and (3) the competition intensity, defined as the maxiumum absolute value of total change in competitors' demand over change in own demand due to a unit change in own price. We first examine the case where firms have the same demand sensitivity to own price and the same demand sensitivity to competitor prices but different cost and quality parameters. For this case, we prove that the total profit of the industry under Cournot competition is at least as high as the total profit under Bertrand competition if the number of firms is less than 28 or if the competition intensity is less than 0.909 or if the differences in quality and cost competitiveness between firms are small. We also prove that for each firm, the profit achieved under Cournot competition is at least as high as the profit achieved under Bertrand competition if the number of firms is less than eight or if the competition intensity is less than 0.739.

We combine the analysis of spot trading and buyers' disparate private valuations for different suppliers' products, and we jointly endogenize the determination of three major dimensions in contract design: (i) sales contracts versus options contracts, (ii) flat-price versus volume-dependent contracts, and (iii) volume discounts versus volume premia. We build a model in which a supplier of an industrial good transacts with a manufacturer who uses the supplier's product to produce an end good with an uncertain demand. We show that, consistent with industry observations, volume-dependent optimal sales contracts always demonstrate volume discounts (i.e., involve concave pricing). However, options are more complex agreements, and optimal option contracts can involve both volume discounts and volume premia. Three major contract structures commonly emerge in optimality. First, if the seller has a high discount rate relative to the buyer and the seller's production costs or the production capacity is low, the optimal contracts tend to be flat-price sales contracts. Second, when the seller has a relatively high discount rate compared to the buyer but production costs or production capacity are high, the optimal contracts are sales contracts with volume discounts. Third, if the buyer's discount rate is high relative to the seller's, then the optimal contracts tend to be volume-dependent options contracts and can involve both volume discounts and volume premia. However, when the seller's production capacity is sufficiently low, it is possible to observe flat-price option contracts. Furthermore, we provide links between production and spot market characteristics, contract design, and efficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0905","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement contract structures and pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because the exact valuation of this real option is computationally intractable, we develop a novel and tractable heuristic model for its strategic valuation that integrates models of LNG shipping, natural gas price evolution, and inventory control and sale into the wholesale natural gas market. We incorporate real and estimated data to quantify the value of this real option and its dependence on the throughput of an LNG chain, the type of price variability, the type of inventory control policy employed, and the level of stochastic variability in both the shipping model and the natural gas price model used. In addition, we develop an imperfect information dual upper bound to assess the effectiveness of our heuristic and find that our method is near optimal.

First, we let each stage's expected inventory cost be a generalized nonconcave non-closed-form function of its incoming and outgoing service time. This allows the GS model to incorporate important phenomena such as variable stage times and nonnested review periods, which previous GS literature has not allowed. Second, we optimize the generalized cost GS model for directed acyclic networks, rather than assembly/distribution networks or trees. For the resulting NP-hard optimization problem, we present a provably optimal algorithm that runs within minutes for 29 chains from a data set of 38 real-world supply chains ranging from 8 to 2,025 stages. We also present two significantly faster yet near-optimal heuristics. One heuristic is motivated by the structure of the formulation's dual space, whereas the other heuristic simply terminates the optimization algorithm after a fixed number of iterations. As a performance benchmark, on the 38 chains, the first heuristic has an average optimality gap of approximately 1.1% and average run time of 88 seconds, whereas the second heuristic has an average optimality gap of 2.8% and an average run time of 5.9 seconds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1100.0913","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical enhancements to inventory optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2011","59","3","Alaa H.

Most degradation processes can be monitored using sensor technology. The resulting degradation signals are usually correlated with the degradation process. A system is considered to have failed once its degradation signal reaches a prespecified failure threshold. This paper considers a replacement problem for components whose degradation process can be monitored using dedicated sensors. First, we present a stochastic degradation modeling framework that characterizes, in real time, the path of a component's degradation signal. These signals are used to predict the evolution of the component's degradation state. Next, we formulate a single-unit replacement problem as a Markov decision process and utilize the real-time signal observations to determine a replacement policy. We focus on exponentially increasing degradation signals and show that the optimal replacement policy for this class of problems is a monotonically nondecreasing control limit policy. Finally, the model is used to determine an optimal replacement policy by utilizing vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0912","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of engineering systems and replacement policies without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Examples of correlated inputs include processing times of workpieces across several workcenters in manufacturing facilities and product demands and exchange rates in global supply chains. Our goal is to obtain mean performance measures and confidence intervals for simulations with such correlated inputs by accounting for the uncertainty around the NORTA distribution parameters estimated from finite historical input data. This type of uncertainty is known as the parameter uncertainty in the discrete-event stochastic simulation literature. We demonstrate how to capture parameter uncertainty with a Bayesian model that uses Sklar's marginal-copula representation and Cooke's copula-vine specification for sampling the parameters of the NORTA distribution. The development of such a Bayesian model well suited for handling many correlated inputs is the primary contribution of this paper. We incorporate the Bayesian model into the simulation replication algorithm for the joint representation of stochastic uncertainty and parameter uncertainty in the mean performance estimate and the confidence interval. We show that our model improves both the consistency of the mean line-item fill-rate estimates and the coverage of the confidence intervals in multiproduct inventory simulations with correlated demands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0915","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic simulations and parameter uncertainty without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We offer important improvements over existing approaches based on the widely used data envelopment analysis (DEA), which has two major limitations in its application to resource allocation. First, traditional DEA models compute efficiency scores by optimizing firm-specific shadow prices of inputs and outputs. This could be problematic, because in practice stakeholders would usually require unanimously agreed-upon trade-offs among evaluation criteria. Second, previous allocation approaches based on DEA do not allow for controlling the risk exposure of allocation portfolios. To tackle these problems, we propose an efficiency measure based on equilibrium shadow prices of different criteria, and we use the bootstrap efficiency distributions to gather information regarding efficiency variations and correlations. Through our methodology, decision makers can obtain the risk-minimizing allocation portfolio.

Using a novel decision tree optimization approach to represent the cascading sequences of probabilistic events as controlled by key decisions and investment alternatives, the problem is modeled as a nonconvex mixed-integer 0-1 factorable program. We develop a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm in which lower bounds are computed via tight linear relaxations of the original problem that are constructed by utilizing a polyhedral outer-approximation mechanism in concert with two alternative linearization schemes having different levels of tightness and complexity. We also suggest three alternative branching schemes, each of which is proven to guarantee convergence to a global optimum for the underlying problem.

In particular, we investigate when it is better to take advantage of synergy among servers, rather than exploiting the servers' special skills, to achieve the best possible system throughput. We show that when there is no trade-off between server synergy and servers' special skills (because the servers are generalists who are equally skilled at all tasks), the optimal policy has servers working in teams of two or more at all times. Moreover, for Markovian systems with two stations and two servers, we provide a complete characterization of the optimal policy and show that, depending on how well the servers work together, the optimal policy either takes full advantage of servers' special skills, or full advantage of server synergy (and hence there is no middle ground in this case). Finally, for a class of larger Markovian systems, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee that the optimal policy should take full advantage of server synergy at all times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0934","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and server optimization without any reference to social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on the distribution-free newsvendor model with censored demands. The assumption is that the demand distribution is not known and there are only sales data available. We study the theoretical performance of the new policies and show that for discrete demand distributions they converge almost surely to the set of optimal solutions. Computational experiments suggest that the new policies converge for general demand distributions, not necessarily discrete, and demonstrate that they are significantly more robust than previously known policies. As a by-product of the theoretical analysis, we obtain new results on the asymptotic consistency of the Kaplan-Meier estimator for discrete random variables that extend existing work in statistics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Kaplan-Meier estimator within an adaptive optimization algorithm, in particular, the first application to stochastic inventory control models.

A multiple-period model is necessitated by the multiple stages, capacity limits, stochastic demand, and the explicit consideration of inventories. With appropriate salvage value functions, a Markov equilibrium policy is found. Intuitive profit dominance allows for existence of a unique equilibrium solution, which is shown to be a modified echelon base-stock policy. This equilibrium policy structure is sustained in the infinite horizon. A numerical study compares the behavior of the decentralized system with the first-best integrated capacitated system. The performance of this decentralized system relative to the integrated system across other parameters can be very good over a broad range of values. This implies that an acceptable system performance may be attained without the imposition of a contract or other coordinating mechanism, which themselves may encounter difficulties in implementation in the form of negotiation, execution, or enforcement of these agreements. We find instances where tighter capacities may actually enhance channel efficiency.

The OEM faces stochastic demand for a final product that requires assembly of two major components, one of which is procured exclusively from the supplier. In the absence of competition, the supplier is able to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the OEM in the form of a menu of price-quantity contracts. The OEM possesses private information across two dimensions: (1) demand forecasts about the final product, and (2) production cost of the in-house component. Both pieces of information are relevant to the total supply chain profit, thus affecting the supplier's optimal offer. By initially assuming an exogenous information structure, we characterize the supplier's optimal contract menu for a simple case and demonstrate that more dimensions of asymmetric information are not always preferable for the OEM but could be beneficial for the supply chain. We subsequently examine whether this preference for one less dimension of private information implies disclosure of private information to the supplier when the information structure is endogenized. Our results indicate that if OEMs that are indifferent between disclosing and keeping information private choose to disclose it, disclosure of any verifiable information from all OEMs is always an equilibrium, whereas nondisclosure might fail to be an equilibrium. We also consider the possibility of the OEM and the supplier contracting at the ex-ante stage, i.e., before the OEM observes his private information. When both dimensions of the OEM's private information are verifiable and the cost of disclosing information is small enough, an ex-ante agreement on information disclosure is always possible; otherwise its feasibility depends on the problem parameters.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0928","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and information asymmetry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that an ANOVA-like estimator of the variance of the conditional expectation is unbiased under mild conditions, and we discuss the optimal number of inner-level samples to minimize this estimator's variance given a fixed computational budget. We show that as the computational budget increases, the optimal number of inner-level samples remains bounded. This finding contrasts with previous work on two-level simulation problems in which the inner- and outer-level sample sizes must both grow without bound for the estimation error to approach zero. The finding implies that the variance of a conditional expectation can be estimated to arbitrarily high precision by a simulation experiment with a fixed inner-level computational effort per scenario, which we call a one-and-a-half-level simulation.

In both of these structures, it is assumed that the returns to scale (RTS) classification, consistent with the classical definition, applies to the entire (input, output) bundle. In many settings it can be the case that the output bundle can be separated into distinct subsets or business units wherein an RTS-type behavior may be different for one subgroup than for another.

Inadequate inpatient nursing levels have also been cited as a significant factor in medical errors and emergency room overcrowding. Yet, there is widespread dissatisfaction with the current methods of determining nurse staffing levels, including the most common one of using minimum nurse-to-patient ratios. In this paper, we represent the nursing system as a variable finite-source queuing model. We develop a reliable, tractable, easily parameterized two-dimensional model to approximate the actual interdependent dynamics of bed occupancy levels and demands for nursing. We use this model to show how unit size, nursing intensity, occupancy levels, and unit length-of-stay affect the impact of nursing levels on performance and thus how inflexible nurse-to-patient ratios can lead to either understaffing or overstaffing. The model is also useful for estimating the impact of nurse staffing levels on emergency department overcrowding.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0943","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['nursing care', 'patient satisfaction', 'medical errors']","The article discusses nursing levels and their impact on patient care, highlighting themes of patient satisfaction and medical errors.

This work is motivated by the robust optimization models arising from portfolio selection problems. Indeed, the whole paper is centered around robust portfolio models and solutions. The basic setting is to find a portfolio that maximizes (respectively, minimizes) the expected utility (respectively, disutility) values in the midst of infinitely many possible ambiguous distributions of the investment returns fitting the given mean and variance estimations. First, we show that the single-stage portfolio selection problem within this framework, whenever the disutility function is in the form of lower partial moments (LPM), or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or value-at-risk (VaR), can be solved analytically. The results lead to the solutions for single-stage robust portfolio selection models. Furthermore, the results also lead to a multistage adjustable robust optimization (ARO) solution when the disutility function is the second-order LPM. Exploring beyond the confines of convex optimization, we also consider the so-called S-shaped value function, which plays a key role in the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky. The nonrobust version of the problem is shown to be NP-hard in general. However, we present an efficient procedure for solving the robust counterpart of the same portfolio selection problem. In this particular case, the consideration of the robustness actually helps to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we consider the situation whereby we have some additional information about the chance that a quadratic function of the random distribution reaches a certain threshold. That information helps to further reduce the ambiguity in the robust model. We show that the robust optimization problem in that case can be solved by means of semidefinite programming (SDP), if no more than two additional chance inequalities are to be incorporated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0950","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk measures and portfolio selection without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The PR of a MINLP can be formulated either as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP), provided that the original objective function is SOCP-representable, or as a semi-infinite MINLP. In this paper, we show that under some further assumptions (rather restrictive, but satisfied in several practical applications), the PR of a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) can also be reformulated as a piecewise-quadratic program (QP), ultimately yielding a QP relaxation of roughly the same size of the standard continuous relaxation. Furthermore, if the original problem has some exploitable structure, then this structure is typically preserved in the reformulation, thus allowing the construction of specialized approaches for solving the PR. We report on implementing these ideas on two MIQPs with appropriate structure: a sensor placement problem and a quadratic-cost (single-commodity) network design problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0930","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mixed-integer nonlinear programming without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

The firm needs to coordinate the pricing and inventory replenishment decisions in each period to maximize its total discounted profit over a finite planning horizon. We develop the general model and characterize the optimal policies for two special scenarios, namely, a model with inventory carryover and no fixed price-change costs and a model with fixed price-change costs and no inventory carryover.

In our model, a firm undertakes a small-scale pilot project to learn, via Bayesian updating, about the project's profitability, which is known to be in one of two possible states. The firm continuously observes the project's cumulative profit, but the true state of the profitability is not immediately revealed because of the inherent noise in the profit stream. The firm bases its exit or expansion decision on the posterior probability distribution of the profitability. The optimal policy is characterized by a pair of thresholds for the posterior probability.

To mitigate the negative effects, some agencies use reserve selection models to identify conservation sites for purchase or retention. Existing models assume that conservation has no impact on nearby land prices. We propose a new integer program that relaxes this assumption via adaptive cost coefficients. Our model accounts for the two key land price feedbacks that arise in markets where conservation competes with development: the amenity premium and price increases driven by shifts in market equilibriums. We illustrate the mechanics of the proposed model in a real land retention context. The results suggest that in competitive land markets, the optimal conservation strategy during the initial phase of the retention effort might be to use available dollars to buy fewer parcels with smaller total area that are under high risk of development. We show that failure to capture the land-price feedbacks can lead to significant losses in biological conservation. The present study is the first to create a reserve selection model that captures the economic theory of competitive land markets in a dynamic framework, produces tangible, parcel-level conservation recommendations, and works on problems with thousands of potential site selection decisions and several planning periods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0961","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['conservation', 'urban growth', 'ecosystem functions', 'amenity premium']","The article discusses conservation strategies in the context of urban growth and ecosystem functions, indicating a moderate focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility.

They can be simulated from a Poisson process by time scaling with the cumulative intensity. The paths of the cumulative intensity are often generated with a discretization method. However, discretization introduces bias into the simulation results. The magnitude of the bias is difficult to quantify. This paper develops a sampling method that eliminates the need to discretize the cumulative intensity. The method is based on a projection argument and leads to unbiased simulation estimators. It is exemplified for a point process whose intensity is a function of a jump-diffusion process and the point process itself. In this setting, the method facilitates the exact sampling of both the point process and the driving jump-diffusion process.

Each firm is characterized by a production cost that is convex in the output produced, and firms act as profit maximizers. We consider a uniform price market design that uses supply function bidding: firms declare the amount they would supply at any positive price, and a single price is chosen to clear the market. We are interested in evaluating the impact of price-anticipating behavior both on the allocative efficiency of the market and on the prices seen at equilibrium. We show that by restricting the strategy space of the firms to parameterized supply functions, we can provide upper bounds on both the inflation of aggregate cost at the Nash equilibrium relative to the socially optimal level, as well as the markup of the Nash equilibrium price above the competitive level: as long as N > 2 firms are competing, these quantities are both upper bounded by 1 + 1/(N \u2212 2). This result holds even in the presence of asymmetric cost structure across firms. We also discuss several extensions, generalizations, and related issues.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0980","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market design and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Motivated by the problem of optimizing randomized, and thus unpredictable, patrols, we present a class of patrolling games. The facility to be patrolled can be thought of as a network or graph Q of interconnected nodes (e.g., rooms, terminals), and the Attacker can choose to attack any node of Q within a given time T. He requires m consecutive periods there, uninterrupted by the Patroller, to commit his nefarious act (and win). The Patroller can follow any path on the graph. Thus, the patrolling game is a win-lose game, where the Value is the probability that the Patroller successfully intercepts an attack, given best play on both sides. We determine analytically either the Value of the game, or bounds on the Value, for various classes of graphs, and we discuss possible extensions and generalizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0983","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to optimizing patrol strategies for security without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Usually the agents should serve only their own customers, but we want an automatic control that activates serving some of the other customers when an unexpected overload occurs. Assuming that the identity of the class that will experience the overload or the timing and extent of the overload are unknown, we proposed a queue-ratio control with thresholds: When a weighted difference of the queue lengths crosses a prespecified threshold, with the weight and the threshold depending on the class to be helped, serving the other customers is activated so that a certain queue ratio is maintained. We then developed a simple deterministic steady-state fluid approximation, based on flow balance, under which this control was shown to be optimal, and we showed how to calculate the control parameters. In this sequel we focus on the fluid approximation itself and describe its transient behavior, which depends on a heavy-traffic averaging principle. The new fluid model developed here is an ordinary differential equation driven by the instantaneous steady-state probabilities of a fast-time-scale stochastic process. The averaging principle also provides the basis for an effective Gaussian approximation for the steady-state queue lengths. Effectiveness of the approximations is confirmed by simulation experiments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0985","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and queue management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that good flexible process structures are essentially highly connected graphs, and we use the concept of graph expansion (a measure of graph connectivity) to achieve various insights into this design problem. Whereas existing literature on process flexibility has focused on the expected performance of process structure, we analyze in this paper the worst-case performance of the flexible structure design problem under a more general setting, which encompasses a large class of objective functions. Chou et al. [Chou, M. C., G. Chua, C. P. Teo, H. Zheng. 2010. Design for process flexibility: Efficiency of the long chain and sparse structure. Oper. Res.58(1) 43\u201358] showed the existence of a sparse process structure that performs nearly as well as the fully flexible system on average, but the approach using random sampling yields few insights into the nature of the process structure. We show that the \u03c8-expander structure, a variant of the graph expander structure (a highly connected but sparse graph) often used in communication networks, is within \u03f5-optimality of the fully flexible system for all demand scenarios. Furthermore, the same expander structure works uniformly well for all objective functions in our class. Based on this insight, we derive design guidelines for general nonsymmetrical systems and develop a simple and easy-to-implement heuristic to design flexible process structures. Numerical results show that this simple heuristic performs well for a variety of numerical examples previously studied in the literature and compares favourably even with the best solutions obtained via extensive simulation and known demand distribution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0987","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of process flexibility and performance optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Antigenic drifts and the high rate of influenza transmission require annual updates to the flu shot composition. The World Health Organization recommends which flu strains to include in the annual vaccine, based on surveillance and epidemiological analysis. There are two critical decisions regarding the flu shot design. One is its composition; currently, three strains constitute the flu shot, and they influence vaccine effectiveness. Another critical decision is the timing of the composition decisions, which affects the flu shot production. Both of these decisions have to be made under uncertainty many months before the flu season starts.

To maximize the protection of open space and ecosystems, community planners and conservation organizations can take preemptive action either by purchasing land before it is developed or by providing incentives to landowners not to sell their land for development. In either case, the parcels must be prioritized for retention. While a significant body of literature addresses this need for prioritization, optimal reserve selection models do not account for land-price feedback effects that arise in markets where open space conservation competes with development. In competitive land markets, conservation acquisitions can affect land prices either by increasing demand, and thereby shifting the competitive equilibrium, or by inducing amenity premiums. People are willing to pay more for lots that are adjacent to reserves. These price effects can lead to increased development outside of the reserves and unintended loss of open space and valued ecosystem functions. In \u201cDynamic Reserve Selection: Optimal Land Retention with Land-Price Feedbacks,\u201d S. F. T\u00f3th, R. G. Haight, and L. W. Rogers fill this gap by formulating a linear-integer programming model with adaptive cost coefficients that are endogenous to the parcel acquisition decisions. They show that it is not always optimal to buy as much land for conservation as possible early on in the land retention effort. Buying fewer, smaller but more expensive parcels that have high conservation value and higher risk of development appears to be optimal in many market scenarios. They also show that failure to account for these price effects can lead to significant losses in biological conservation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0995","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['ecosystem', 'conservation', 'biological diversity', 'community planners', 'open space']","The article discusses the importance of conservation and the impact of urban development on ecosystems, highlighting themes of environmental sustainability and community planning.

Loss-averse consumers are more sensitive to perceived losses than gains relative to this reference price. We find that a range of constant pricing policies is optimal for the corresponding dynamic pricing problem. This range is wider the more consumers anchor on lowest prices, and it persists when buyers are loss neutral, in contrast with previous literature. In a transient regime, the optimal pricing policy is monotone and converges to a steady-state price, which is lower the more extreme and salient the low-price anchor is. Our results suggest that behavioral regularities, such as peak-end anchoring and loss aversion, limit the benefits of varying prices, and caution that the adverse effects of deep discounts on the firm's optimal prices and profits might be more enduring than previous models predict.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0952","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that although the manufacturer needs retailers' mean demand and standard deviation for her wholesale price decision, each retailer only needs to know the other retailer's demand standard deviation for his order quantity decision. However, an incentive compatibility analysis shows that retailers have incentives to share their demand information untruthfully. Although a truth-inducing scheme can be developed for a system with symmetric retailers who share information between themselves, no such scheme can be developed to ensure truth-telling to the manufacturer. Further, we develop a coordination mechanism (CIS) for the decentralized inventory-sharing system, considering information asymmetry. We show that CIS coordinates the manufacturer-retailers system and leads to an all-win situation under complete information. More importantly, CIS minimizes the value of information such that each party can obtain expected profits very close to their first-best profits even under asymmetric information and hence indirectly solves the information asymmetry problem.

This means that when the server utilization is held constant, the marginal decrease in the probability that all servers are busy in the M/M/s queue brought about by the addition of two extra servers is always less than twice the decrease brought about by the addition of one extra server. As a consequence, a method of marginal analysis yields the optimal number of servers that minimize the waiting and service costs when the server utilization is held constant. In addition, it is shown that the expected number of customers in the queue and in the system, as well as the expected waiting time and sojourn in the M/M/s queue, are convex in the number of servers when the server utilization is held constant. These results are useful in design studies involving capacity planning in service operations.

The processed commodity is sold using forward contracts, while the input itself can be traded at the end of the horizon. We solve this problem optimally and derive closed-form expressions for the marginal value of input and output inventory. We find that the optimal procurement and processing decisions are governed by price-dependent inventory thresholds. We use commodity markets data for the soybean complex to conduct numerical studies and find that approximating the joint price processes of multiple output commodities using a single, composite output product and using the approximate price process to determine procurement and processing decisions is near optimal. Compared to a myopic spread-option-based heuristic, the optimization-based dynamic programming policy provides significant benefits under conditions of tight processing capacities and high price volatilities.

Then, by combining SHADOW-RM with another policy, SHADOW-LB, proposed in our previous work for systems that are not overloaded, we suggest policy SHADOW-TANDEM, which automatically and seamlessly detects overload and reduces to one of the schemes, SHADOW-RM or SHADOW-LB, accordingly. Extensive simulations demonstrate a remarkably good performance of proposed policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0960","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for optimizing server systems without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We explicitly model the workload experienced by s nurses within a single medical unit with n homogeneous patients as a closed M/M/s//n queueing system, where each patient alternates between requiring assistance and not. The performance of the medical unit is based on the probability of excessive delay, the relative frequency with which the delay between the onset of patient neediness and the provision of care from a nurse exceeds a given time threshold. Using new many-server asymptotic results, we find that effective staffing policies should deviate from threshold-specific nurse-to-patient ratios by factors that take into account the total number of patients present in the unit. In particular, our staffing rule significantly differs from California Bill AB 394, legislation that mandates fixed nurse-to-patient staffing ratios.

In these instances, the decision-making process should be informed by the relevance of interactions. However, because of system and model complexity, a rigorous study for determining whether and how interactions quantitatively impact operational choices has not been developed yet. In light of the central role played by the multilinearity of the decision support models, we investigate the presence of interactions in multilinear functions first. We identify interactions that can be a priori excluded from the analysis. We introduce sensitivity measures that apportion the model output change to individual factors and interaction contributions in an exact fashion. The sensitivity measures are linked to graphical representation methods as tornado diagrams and Pareto charts, and a systematic way of inferring managerial insights is presented. We then specialize the findings to reliability and probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) problems. We set forth a procedure for determining the magnitude of changes that make interactions relevant in the analysis. Quantitative results are discussed by application to a PSA model developed at NASA to support decision making in space mission planning and design. Numerical findings show that suboptimal decisions concerning the components on which to focus managerial attention can be made, if the decision-making process is not informed by the relevance of interactions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1110.0973","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk assessment and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

How delay announcements can influence customers in service systems is a complex problem that depends on both the dynamics of the underlying queueing system and on the customers' strategic behavior. We examine this problem of information communication by considering a model in which both the firm and the customers act strategically: the firm in choosing its delay announcement while anticipating customer response, and the customers in interpreting these announcements and in making the decision about when to join the system and when to balk. We characterize the equilibrium language that emerges between the service provider and her customers. The analysis of the emerging equilibria provides new and interesting insights into customer-firm information sharing. We show that even though the information provided to customers is nonverifiable, it improves the profits of the firm and the expected utility of the customers. The robustness of the results is illustrated via various extensions of the model. In particular, studying models with incomplete information on the system parameters allows us also to highlight the role of information provision in managing customer expectations regarding the congestion in the system. Further, the information could be as simple as \u201chigh congestion\u201d/\u201clow congestion\u201d announcements, or it could be as detailed as the true state of the system.

In most applications, the allocation of resources is determined by a finite number of independent players, each optimizing an individual objective function. An important question in all these applications is the degree of suboptimality caused by selfish resource allocation. We consider the worst-case efficiency of cost sharing methods in resource allocation games in terms of the ratio of the minimum guaranteed surplus of a Nash equilibrium and the maximal surplus. Our main technical result is an upper bound on the efficiency loss that depends on the class of allowable cost functions and the class of allowable cost sharing methods.

We focus on some of the risks faced today by investors in generation capacity and thus pose the problem as a stochastic equilibrium model. We illustrate the approach on the problem of the incentive to invest. Agents can be risk neutral or risk averse. We model risk aversion through the CVaR of plants' profit. The CVaR induces risk-adjusted probabilities according to which investors value their plants. The model is formulated as a complementarity problem (including the CVaR valuation of investments). An illustration is provided on a small problem that captures several features of today's electricity world: a choice often restricted to coal and gas units, a peaky load curve because of wind penetration, uncertain fuel prices, and an evolving carbon market. We assess the potential of the approach by comparing energy-only and capacity market organizations in this risky environment. Our results can be summarized as follows: a deterministic analysis overlooks some changes of capacity structure induced by risk, whether in the capacity market or energy-only organizations. The risk-neutral analysis also misses a shift towards less capital-intensive technologies that may result from risk aversion. Last, risk aversion also increases the shortage of capacity compared to the risk-neutral view in the energy-only market when the price cap is low. This may have a dramatic impact on the bill to the final consumer. The approach relies on mathematical programming techniques and can be extended to full-size problems.

Observational field data from structural engineering groups in three firms and hardware engineering groups in three firms revealed that the two occupations exhibited different patterns of learning episodes and different distributions of actors across those episodes, or what, following the work of Roger Barker, we call two distinct teaching-learning ecologies. After detailing the differences in the two ecologies, we show how these differences emerged from patterns of behavior that were influenced by unique sets of environmental and technological constraints.

By focusing on production organization and practices in a late developing context, this paper explains the intertwined process of spreading new standards and changing existing local practices by elaborating the relationship among building collective capabilities, learning, and standards diffusion. This study enriches current views on institutional effects and adds to the practice-based literature, as well as to the work on developing economy firms in organizational research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0514","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['developing economy', 'collective capabilities', 'standards diffusion']","The article discusses the diffusion of quality standards in a developing country context, emphasizing collective knowledge-building and local practices.

Because each GM exercises control and authority over their business unit's resources, they operate at the nexus of firm-level strategy and strategy implementation through the development of business-unit-level strategy and tactics. Moreover, they play an essential role in adapting the organization by collectively sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring resources and thereby capturing product-market opportunities that emerge. However, there is little direct empirical understanding of this important executive leadership group. This study begins to address this gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between the characteristics of the set of business-unit general managers and firm performance in six firms operating in the high-dynamic software industry with an in-depth comparative case study. New theory is developed that begins to open the \u201cblack box\u201d of executive leadership groups, and in so doing contributes new understanding of executive leadership groups and dynamic managerial capabilities, and thereby introduces the notion of an episodic team.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0515","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['leadership', 'strategy', 'performance']","The article focuses primarily on managerial capabilities and firm performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The focus in this literature has been on two primary outcomes: performance benefits and rewards (including promotion and compensation). These two types of outcomes have often been conflated, however, despite the fact that high levels of one do not guarantee high levels of the other. We examined the effects of job performance, network tie strength, and network structures on the size of the year-end bonuses received by 71 relationship officers in a major, multinational commercial bank. We found that in networks based on information acquisition, both strong ties and sparse networks are positively associated with high bonuses, as is the combination of the two. In networks based on approval and support for one's deals, neither tie strength nor density predicts bonus size, but the benefits of strong ties increase as network density increases. Our results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing networks based on collegial relations from those based on authority, as well as the importance of distinguishing the network factors that improve performance from those that generate favorable evaluations independent of performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0516","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['performance', 'rewards', 'network structures']","The article primarily focuses on performance and rewards within commercial banking, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

The Role of Tie Content and Social Networks","Understanding the determinants of creativity at the individual and organizational level has been the focus of a long history of research in various disciplines from the social sciences, but little attention has been devoted to studying creativity at the dyadic level. Why are some dyadic interactions more likely than others to trigger the generation of novel and useful ideas in organizations? As dyads conduit both knowledge and social forces, they offer an ideal setting to disentangle the effects of knowledge diversity, tie strength, and network structure on the generation of creative thoughts. This paper not only challenges the current belief that sporadic and distant dyadic relationships (weak ties) foster individual creativity but also argues that diverse and strong ties facilitate the generation of creative ideas. From a knowledge viewpoint, our results suggest that ties that transmit a wide (rather than narrow) set of knowledge domains (within the same tie) favor creative idea generation if exchanges occur with sufficient frequency. From a social perspective, we find that strong ties serve as effective catalysts for the generation of creative ideas when they link actors who are intrinsically motivated to work closely together. Finally, this paper also shows that dyadic network cohesion (i.e., the connections from the focal dyad to common contacts) does not always hinder the generation of creative ideas. Our empirical evidence suggests that when cohesion exceeds its average levels, it becomes detrimental to creative idea generation. Hypotheses are tested in a sociometric study conducted within the development department of a software firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0519","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['diversity', 'social forces', 'creativity', 'strong ties']","The article discusses the role of diverse ties in fostering creativity, which touches on themes of diversity and social dynamics.

Given the social stigma associated with domestic partnerships of lesbians and gay men during the period of the study, the provision of these benefits was highly controversial and induced intense contestation between proponents and opponents of the institution of equal treatment for lesbian and gay employees. We explore the diffusion of theses benefits using data on cumulative adoptions by similar others, state laws forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation, and overall tenor in press coverage of the benefits. Our analysis shows that the cumulative number of adoptions within industry increased the positive effect of state laws on the corporation's decision to provide the benefits. However, the cumulative number of adoptions in the state of the corporation's headquarters decreased the positive effects of both state laws and overall tenor in press coverage on such a decision. Accordingly, our study contributes to institutional theory by pointing to complex interactive influences of institutional mechanisms on the institutionalization of contested practices, and to the literature on lesbian and gay issues in the workplace by studying factors influencing organizational decisions to adopt policies supportive of lesbian and gay employees.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0521","","OS","Management & Organizations","9","['same-sex partner health benefits', 'equal treatment', 'lesbian and gay employees', 'social stigma', 'institutionalization']","The article focuses on the adoption of same-sex partner health benefits, highlighting issues of equal treatment and social stigma associated with LGBTQ+ employees.

However, with very few exceptions, the specific organizational routines and processes that constitute AC capabilities remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a routine-based model of AC as a first step toward the operationalization of the AC construct. Our intent is to direct attention to the importance of balancing internal knowledge creating processes with the identification, acquisition, and assimilation of new knowledge originating in the external environment. We decompose the construct of AC into two components, internal and external AC capabilities, and identify the configuration of metaroutines underlying these two components. These higher-level routines are expressed within organizations by configurations of empirically observable practiced routines that are idiosyncratic and firm specific. Therefore, we conceptualize metaroutines as the foundations of practiced routines. The ability of organizations to discover and implement complementarities between AC routines may explain why some firms are successful early adopters and most firms are imitators. Success as an early adopter of a new management practice or an innovation is expected to depend on the extent to which an organization evolves, adapts, and implements the configuration of its internal and external absorptive capacity routines.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0525","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational routines', 'knowledge', 'innovation']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of absorptive capacity and organizational routines without any explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

From this perspective, culture does not directly shape technological artifacts. Rather, a technology concept activates culture as it draws frames around resources that will guide people's problem construction practices. By acting as a frame through which problems can be constructed, technology concepts play a key role in selecting the set of cultural resources that will be used to develop technological artifacts.

The technology is lauded by its proponents as a powerful tool for communication and excoriated by its critics as dangerously simplifying. This study takes a deeper look into how PowerPoint is mobilized in strategy making through an ethnographic study inside one organization. It treats PowerPoint as a technology embedded in the discursive practices of strategic knowledge production and suggests that these practices make up the epistemic or knowledge culture of the organization. Conceptualizing culture as composed of practices foregrounds the \u201cmachineries\u201d of knowing. Results from a genre analysis of PowerPoint use suggest that it should not be characterized simply as effective or ineffective, as current PowerPoint controversies do. Instead, I show how the affordances of PowerPoint enabled the difficult task of collaborating to negotiate meaning in an uncertain environment, creating spaces for discussion, making recombinations possible, allowing for adjustments as ideas evolved, and providing access to a wide range of actors. These affordances also facilitated cartographic efforts to draw boundaries around the scope of a strategy by certifying certain ideas and allowing document owners to include or exclude certain slides or participants. These discursive practices\u2014collaboration and cartography\u2014are part of the \u201cepistemic machinery\u201d of strategy culture.

I demonstrate that although cultural toolkits supporting change may allow less powerful organization members to see traditional practices as running counter to their interests, they may not be able to significantly change traditional practices unless they also have access to what I call political toolkits (including tools such as staffing systems, accountability systems, and evaluation systems) that support change.

Prior research suggests that the business press shapes organizational outcomes, but the question of how these effects depend on organizations' positions in a field has attracted limited attention. We address this theoretical limitation in an analysis of how mutual funds in Sweden were affected by periods when the business press increased its negative coverage of mutual fund fees.

In contrast to prevailing accounts, we suggest that such change can take place in the absence of initiating jolts, may be infused in everyday organizational life, and led by insiders who need not hold hierarchical power. Drawing on data from field studies and in-depth interviews, we develop a model of cultural change in which everyday occurrences such as meetings or workshops are constructed symbolically as \u201climinal\u201d phenomena, bracketed from yet connected to everyday action in the organization. The construction of these occurrences as liminal illuminates the symbolic realm, creating possibilities for people to experiment with new cultural resources and invite different interpretations that hold potential for altering the cultural order. Our analyses contribute to the literature on culture by developing liminality, a process that brings forward the symbolic and invites recombination, as a cultural explanation of cultural change, to complement prevailing political or social structural explanations.

Hence, the objective of this article is to develop a new kind of antenarrative approach for the cultural analysis of organizational change. We use merging multinational corporations (MNCs) as a case in point. Our empirical analysis focuses on a revelatory case: the financial services group Nordea, which was built by combining Swedish, Finnish, Danish, and Norwegian corporations. We distinguish three types of antenarrative that provided alternatives for making sense of the merger: globalist, nationalist, and regionalist (Nordic) antenarratives. We focus on how these antenarratives were mobilized in intentional organizational storytelling to legitimate or resist change: globalist storytelling as a means to legitimate the merger and to create MNC identity, nationalist storytelling to relegitimate national identities and interests, Nordic storytelling to create regional identity, and the critical use of the globalist storytelling to challenge the Nordic identity. We conclude that organizational storytelling is characterized by polyphonic, stylistic, chronotopic, and architectonic dialogisms and by a dynamic between centering and decentering forces. This paper contributes to discourse-cultural studies of organizations by explaining how narrative constructions of identities and interests are used to legitimate or resist change. Furthermore, this analysis elucidates the dialogical dynamics of organizational storytelling and thereby opens up new avenues for the cultural analysis of organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0593","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['narrative', 'identity', 'resistance', 'legitimation', 'organizational change']","The article explores themes of identity and resistance within organizational storytelling, indicating a focus on cultural and social dynamics in the context of multinational corporations.

We propose a theoretical framework about the conditions under which the collective identity of a nascent entrepreneurial group is more likely to be legitimated. Specifically, we posit that legitimacy is more likely to be achieved when members articulate a clear defining collective identity story that identifies the group's orienting purpose and core practices. Although membership expansion can undermine legitimation by introducing discrepant actors and practices to a collective identity, this potential downside is mitigated by growth stories, which help to coordinate expansion.

This location choice requires firms to make a simultaneous choice about the organizational structure of innovation activity: almost by definition, multiple locations per firm imply some degree of decentralization. We compare predictions of the knowledge-based view with the predictions of organizational economics regarding the location and decentralization of R&D. Using firm-level data on R&D locations in Finland, we examine the conditions under which firms with multiple R&D locations also have greater innovation output. Our results indicate that multilocation of R&D activity is positively associated with imitative innovation output and is strongly correlated with greater external knowledge sourcing. We also find that the positive association between multiple R&D locations and innovative output does not apply to new-to-the-market innovations. The results are consistent with the interpretation that multilocation of R&D enables firms to access a broad set of external sources of knowledge in pursuit of imitative rather than new-to-the market innovation. Moreover, these findings imply heterogeneity in R&D strategies between firms pursuing new-to-the-market innovation and firms pursuing imitative innovation. It is thus important to distinguish between new-to-the-market and imitative innovations, because their determinants may differ.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0526","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'decentralization', 'knowledge']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of innovation and organizational structure without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Yet, in many cases, the identities of actors influence these processes. When identity matters, high-status actors often obtain more favorable classifications. We examine these processes in the context of the Motion Picture Association of America's parental guidance classifications of movies (G, PG, R, NC-17). We find that, conditional on a given level of content, films distributed by the Association's members and those that involve more central producers and directors receive more lenient classifications than those carried by independent distributors and involving more peripheral personnel. Conversely, and again conditional on content, films involving directors with a history of producing R-rated features receive more restrictive ratings. We discuss the mechanisms that might account for these effects. Regardless of the mechanism, however, because ratings influence revenue and consequently profitability, the movie certification system in the United States places independent distributors and peripheral individuals at a disadvantage, relative to their larger and more central rivals.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0533","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'classification', 'disadvantage', 'independent distributors']","The article discusses how identity influences classification processes, leading to disadvantages for independent distributors compared to central actors, which touches on themes of equity and social justice.

We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0536","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['narrative', 'organizational learning', 'unusual experiences']","The article discusses the importance of narrative development in organizational learning, which suggests a reflective and inclusive approach to understanding diverse experiences.

A Social Embeddedness Reconciliation of Conduct and Performance in Public Family Businesses","Two contradictory perspectives of family business conduct and performance are prominent in the literature. The stewardship perspective argues that family business owners and managers will act as farsighted stewards of their companies, investing generously in the business to enhance value for all stakeholders. By contrast, the agency and behavioral agency perspectives maintain that major family owners, in catering to family self-interest, will underinvest in the firm, avoid risk, and extract resources. This paper argues that both these views have application but under different circumstances, determined in part by the degree to which the firm and its executive actors are embedded within the family and thus identify with its interests. Stewardship behavior will be less common, and agency behavior will be more common the greater the number of family directors, officers, generations, and votes, and the more executives are susceptible to family influence.

Collectively, organizations cannot yet rely on a coherent and stable definition of what membership in that new industry means. Individually, each organization must also establish its own distinctive identity to differentiate itself from competitors and secure resources. To explore the relationship between differentiation and the consolidation of recognizable identity element clusters, we examine the emergence of organizational form in the early years of the Arizona charter school industry. This industry is particularly interesting for scholars studying institutional processes because the legislative mandate of the new industry was for schools to experiment and provide education in an unconventional manner. Thus, the legislative definition of the organizational form or template for the charter school identity was intentionally underspecified. Using inductive analysis and regression models, we examine the process of identity realization occurring among charter schools and assess how the local institutional context of charter schools affected the realization process. The analyses demonstrate that new industries may come to be characterized by multiple element clusters; a single label for an organizational form may be linked to different combinations of identity elements. Our results also demonstrate that identity realization at the organizational level occurs through mimicry and differentiation processes and is facilitated by the local institutional context. In particular, the diversity of organizational resources available to industry entrepreneurs enables identity differentiation from one's peers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0548","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'diversity', 'organizational form', 'institutional context']","The article discusses themes of identity differentiation and the role of diversity in organizational contexts, which aligns with moderate woke themes in Management & Organizations.

It Depends on the Service Climate and Business Unit Demography","Extending insights from Cox's interactional model of cultural diversity [Cox, T. H., Jr. 1994. Cultural Diversity in Organizations: Theory, Research and Practice. Berett-Koehler, San Francisco], we examine the influence of diversity climate on customer satisfaction, a key business-unit outcome. In addition, we explore service climate and minority and female representations as boundary conditions of the diversity climate\u2013customer satisfaction relationship. Utilizing longitudinal data from 59,592 employees and 1.2 million customers of 769 store units of a large U.S. national retail organization, the results reveal that, as hypothesized, diversity climate is positively and significantly related to customer satisfaction measured a year later. Moreover, the diversity climate\u2013customer satisfaction relationship is most strongly positive in predominately minority, highly pro-service store units, whereas female representation exhibits null moderating effects. These findings have important research and practical implications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0550","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['diversity', 'customer satisfaction', 'minority', 'female representation', 'service climate']","The article emphasizes the importance of diversity climate in relation to customer satisfaction, highlighting minority and female representation as significant factors.

In this paper, we begin to address this gap by investigating firms' investment mode choice between CVC and acquisition, which are alternative modes for pursuing external business development and corporate growth. We propose that when exogenous uncertainty elevates the value of real options, firms are more likely to undertake CVC investments rather than acquisitions. Furthermore, we suggest that the value of real options under uncertainty is contingent upon several factors, which may also shape firms' choice between CVC and acquisition. The results indicate that market uncertainty is positively related to firms' choice of CVC versus acquisition. In addition, investment irreversibility strengthens the effect of uncertainty, whereas growth opportunities surrounding the investment weaken the effect. Our empirical findings and the comparative approach we adopt to studying CVC investments and acquisitions have important implications for theory and research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0551","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate venture capital and acquisition strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption.

The essay also recommends alternative ways of assessing research findings.

Instead of making NHSTs, researchers should adapt their research assessments to specific contexts and specific research goals, and then explain their rationales for selecting assessment indicators. Researchers should show the substantive importance of findings by reporting effect sizes and should acknowledge uncertainty by stating confidence intervals.

Effects of Procedural Fairness, Outcome Favorability, and Concerns About Status","How do individuals with higher status react to their encounters with lower-status counterparts? Four studies explore this issue, focusing on higher-status parties' concerns with the outcome favorability and procedural fairness of those encounters. Across a wide range of contexts and bases of status, Study 1 found an interaction effect in which outcome favorability had a stronger relationship with higher-status parties' reactions when procedural fairness was high rather than low, in sharp contrast to previous findings in the justice literature. Studies 2, 3, and 4 explored the mechanism underlying this novel finding, testing the proposal that this interaction pattern is rooted in higher-status individuals' use of outcome and procedure information to determine whether their counterpart is validating\u2014or challenging\u2014their relatively higher status position. They conduct this test by examining the moderating influence of dispositional factors that vary the extent to which individuals are interested in social information from their lower-status counterpart regarding their relative status position. In particular, they test the prediction that the interaction will be accentuated among individuals who are (1) low in self-esteem, (2) high in need to belong, (3) low in power distance orientation, and (4) high in general concern about status. Results confirm these predictions.

We also extend our theory to consider how relatively negative journalist reports may prompt CEOs to retaliate against individual journalists by limiting or cutting off communication with the offending journalist, and how such retaliation may deter other journalists from issuing negative reports about the firm in the future. We find support for our hypotheses in a unique data set that includes large-sample survey data on CEO\u2013journalist relations. We discuss how our research contributes to the growing literature in organization theory and strategy on the social processes by which corporate leaders influence the behavior of information intermediaries and other external constituents toward their firms.

Organizational learning studies in these settings have largely investigated autonomous learning via cumulative experience as a strategy for performance improvement. Whether induced learning through the use of deliberate learning activities provides additional performance benefits has been neglected. We argue that the use of deliberate learning activities offers performance benefits beyond those of cumulative experience because these activities counter the learning challenges presented by rapid knowledge growth, uncertainty, and complexity in dynamic settings. We test whether there are additional performance benefits to using deliberate learning activities and whether the effectiveness of these activities depends on interdisciplinary collaboration in the workgroup. We test our hypotheses in a study of 23 hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) involved in a quality improvement collaborative. We find that using deliberate learning activities is associated with better workgroup performance, as measured by NICUs' risk-adjusted mortality rates for 2159 infant patients, but only after two years. In the shorter term, using these activities is associated with worse performance. By the third year, the positive impact of using deliberate learning activities is similar to the benefit of cumulative experience (18% and 20% reduction in odds of mortality, respectively). Contrary to prediction, interdisciplinary collaboration mediates, rather than moderates, the relationship between using deliberate learning activities and workgroup performance. Thus, our data suggest that using deliberate learning activities fosters interdisciplinary collaboration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0570","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['interdisciplinary collaboration', 'performance improvement', 'dynamic service settings']","The article discusses performance improvement in hospital settings and emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, which touches on themes of teamwork and collective efficacy.

Yet research also suggests that new media afford people additional flexibility and control by enabling them to communicate from anywhere at any time. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, this paper builds theory that unravels this apparent contradiction. As the literature would predict, we found that the more time people spent handling e-mail, the greater was their sense of being overloaded, and the more e-mail they processed, the greater their perceived ability to cope. Contrary to assumptions of prior studies, we found no evidence that time spent working mediates e-mail-related overload. Instead, e-mail's material properties entwined with social norms and interpretations in a way that led informants to single out e-mail as a cultural symbol of the overload they experience in their lives. Moreover, by serving as a symbol, e-mail distracted people from recognizing other sources of overload in their work lives.

Our theory suggests why (1) there may be a systematic tendency for analysts to underestimate the extent to which other analysts share their reservations about repurchase plans (i.e., reservations about whether plans reflect well on the performance prospects of adopting firms), such that (2) analysts conform to other analysts and issue more positive earnings forecasts and stock recommendations in response to the adoption of repurchase plans despite having private reservations about whether the plans reflect well on adopting firms. We also contend that analysts are less likely to underestimate the extent to which others share their reservations about repurchase plans to the extent that they have frequent communication ties to other analysts. Whereas prior neoinstitutional research on conformity and isomorphism has primarily adopted a cognitive perspective in which actors conform to the behavior of others based on their understandings of a particular policy or practice (i.e., they take the value of the policy for granted or infer the value of the policy from others' prior decisions), we develop a social psychological perspective on isomorphism wherein actors imitate others based on their biased perceptions of others' beliefs about the policy.

Drawing on a series of computational experiments and paired-case comparisons of six product development projects, we specifically examine how new product development performance is affected by project design and the technological environment. By triangulating across the computational experiments and case studies, we find the existence of performance trade-offs in product development as well as the importance of performance priorities in influencing project design. These findings permit us to elaborate on existing contingency-based perspectives of new product development and put forward a novel mediating model. In this mediating model of product development, we suggest that the technological environment shapes performance priorities, which in turn influence project design and ultimately the performance outcomes of new product development efforts. This model further highlights that project designs can evolve as a function of performance outcomes, although this process can be inhibited by the presence of design evolution constraints.

We look for evidence of these mechanisms through a study of the U.S. Savings and Loan (S&L) industry in the 1980s. This is an apt context because S&Ls were confronted by severe environmental changes that suggested a need for change of a relatively radical sort during this decade and because the industry contains a mix of governance forms (stock form firms and mutual associations). We examine whether mutuals and stocks differed in their propensity to move away from their traditional business and mission of residential mortgage lending in response to the challenges of the 1980s. We also consider whether stocks and mutuals differed in their performance outcomes during this decade. Results indicate that mutuals were slightly less prone toward change but were in no sense inertial. They also show that mutuals performed better overall and appeared to change more successfully than did stock firms. The overall pattern of results suggests that mutual governance was a resource that allowed S&Ls to better balance exploration and exploitation in the face of a changing and ambiguous environment. We consider the broader implications of these findings for research on organizational adaptation, governance form, and governance more generally.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0579","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['governance', 'adaptation', 'organizational capacity']","The article discusses governance and organizational adaptation but lacks a strong focus on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or social justice.

As a result, dominant conceptualizations of organizational trust are overly generalized. Building on existing research on organizational trust and stakeholder theory, we introduce a more nuanced perspective on the nature of organizational trust. We develop a framework that distinguishes between organizational stakeholders along two dimensions: depth of the relationship (deep or shallow) and locus (internal or external). The framework identifies which of six dimensions of trustworthiness (benevolence, integrity, managerial competence, technical competence, transparency, and identification) will be relevant to which stakeholder type. We test the predictions of our framework using original survey data from 1,298 respondents across four stakeholder groups from four different organizations. The results reveal that the relevant dimensions of trustworthiness vary systematically across different stakeholder types and provide strong support for the validity of the depth and locus dimensions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0581","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['trust', 'stakeholders', 'transparency', 'benevolence', 'integrity']","The article explores the dimensions of organizational trust and stakeholder theory, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations and the varying needs of different stakeholder groups.

Similar arguments have been made in the marketing literature. We argue that neither literatures take sufficient account of firm organization. Specifically, firms that attempt to leverage user and customer knowledge in the context of innovation must design an internal organization appropriate to support it. This can be achieved in particular through the use of new organizational practices, notably, intensive vertical and lateral communication, rewarding employees for sharing and acquiring knowledge, and high levels of delegation of decision rights. In this paper, six hypotheses were developed and tested on a data set of 169 Danish firms drawn from a 2001 survey of the 1,000 largest firms in Denmark. A key result is that the link from customer knowledge to innovation is completely mediated by organizational practices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0584","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['organizational practices', 'communication', 'knowledge sharing']","The article discusses organizational practices that enhance innovation through customer interaction, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

The positive effect each factor can have on tie strength has been documented across a number of studies, and yet we know surprisingly very little about how the two factors combine to produce strong ties. Being in close proximity could either amplify or dampen the positive effect that social similarity can have on tie strength. Data on tie strength among teachers working in five public schools were analyzed to shed light on this theoretical question. The empirical results indicate that teachers who were similar in age were more likely to be connected by a strong tie, especially teachers for whom age similarity was more likely to be salient. Moreover, teachers who took breaks at the same time or who had classrooms on the same floor communicated more frequently and felt more emotionally attached. Among the public school teachers, propinquity amplified the positive effect that age similarity had on tie strength. The strongest network connections occurred among age-similar teachers who had classrooms on the same floor. The empirical results illustrate the value of considering how social similarity and propinquity contribute to strong ties independently and when combined with each other.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0587","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['social similarity', 'strong ties', 'teachers', 'public schools']","The article discusses social similarity and interpersonal connections among teachers, which touches on themes of community and collaboration, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity.

We begin with the observation that theories of organization and group learning have tended to adopt a rational system model, a model that emphasizes goal-directed and cooperative interactions between and among actors who may differ in knowledge and expertise but are undifferentiated with respect to power and status. Our review of the theoretical and empirical literatures on power, status, and learning suggests that social hierarchy can complicate a rational system model of collective learning by disrupting three critical learning-related processes: anchoring on shared goals, risk taking and experimentation, and knowledge sharing. We also find evidence to suggest that the stifling effects of power and status differences on collective learning can be mitigated when advantaged actors are collectively oriented. Indeed, our review suggests that higher-ranking actors who use their power and status in more \u201csocialized\u201d ways can play critical roles in stimulating collective learning behavior. We conclude by articulating several promising directions for future research that were suggested by our review.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0590","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['power', 'status', 'social hierarchy', 'collective learning', 'advantaged actors']","The article discusses the impact of social hierarchy on collective learning within organizations, highlighting themes of power and status.

As a spur to more cross-level identity research, we offer speculative discussions on two issues concerning nested identities. First, regarding the processes through which identities become linked across levels, we explore how identities at one level of analysis enable and constrain identities at other levels. We argue that, for a collective identity, intrasubjective understanding (\u201cI think\u201d) fosters intersubjective understanding (\u201cwe think\u201d) through interaction, which in turn fosters generic understanding\u2014a sense of the collective that transcends individuals (\u201cit is\u201d). Second, regarding the content of linked identities, we suggest that identities are relatively isomorphic across levels because organizational goals require some internal coherence. However, for various intended and unintended reasons, isomorphism is often impeded across levels, and identities tend to become somewhat differentiated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0591","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'collective identity', 'intersubjective understanding']","The article discusses the concept of identity within organizations, emphasizing collective and intersubjective understanding, which aligns with moderate woke themes related to diversity and social dynamics.

Originally a domain of economics and finance (as well as law), the theme has spread to other areas such as strategic management and organization theory in recent years. This paper will first give a brief overview on major developments in the field of corporate governance. These developments encompass, on the one hand, the extension of the classical focus on formal systems and structures to perspectives that address behavioral as well as process issues. On the other hand, the terrain has been broadened from its traditional narrow interest in the principal agent problem between shareholders and management to the more comprehensive stakeholder approach of corporate governance. Building on these developments, this paper will subsequently elaborate on a further extension of the topic by emphasizing the concept of stakeholder opportunism. The classical principal agent problem results from possible opportunistic behavior of the management, which compromises the interests of the shareholders. However, as the notion of stakeholder opportunism points out, not only the management of a company can exercise opportunism; rather, all stakeholders of a company can (and will to some extent) have options to behave opportunistically and at the same time bear the risk of being victims of the opportunism of other stakeholders. This paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants and dynamics of the various stakeholders' opportunism options and risks as well as of the actual opportunistic behavior of stakeholders. Employing this framework, implications of the notion of stakeholder opportunism for managers and regulators are discussed, and perspectives for further research are identified.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0599","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['stakeholder', 'opportunism', 'corporate governance']","The article discusses the shift from a traditional principal-agent focus to a broader stakeholder approach in corporate governance, indicating a moderate engagement with social responsibility themes.

Attention is not, however, a unitary concept but is used differently in various metatheories: the behavioral theory of the firm, managerial cognition, issue selling, attention-based view, and ecology. At the level of the brain, neuroscientists have identified three varieties of attention: selective attention, executive attention, and vigilance. Attention is shaped by both top-down (i.e., schema-driven) and bottom-up (i.e., stimulus-driven) processes. Inspired by neuroscience research, I classify and compare three varieties of attention studied in organization science: attentional perspective (top-down), attentional engagement (combining top-down and bottom-up executive attention and vigilance), and attentional selection (the outcome of attentional processes). Based on research findings, I develop five propositions on how the varieties of attention in organization provide a theoretical alternative to theories of structural determinism or strategic choice, with a particular focus on the role of attention in explaining organizational adaptation and change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0602","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['attention', 'organizational adaptation', 'change']","The article primarily focuses on the concept of attention within organizational theory without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Knowledge to innovate is dispersed across ecologies, so no single firm or small group of firms can innovate alone. Moreover, many new products and services in ecologies such as health care or energy are complex or comprise many parts with unknown interactions. New products, knowledge, business models, and applications all emerge unpredictably over considerable time periods, as various agents in the ecologies of innovation interact with and react to the actions of others. However, the existing organizing structure in these ecologies stifles emergence and precludes much innovation, simply because theory and practice do not adequately address how to organize for complex innovation. We develop a preliminary model for organizing ecologies of complex innovation. We suggest that innovations can continually emerge productively if people work locally in ecologies to set and solve problems of orchestrating knowledge capabilities across the ecology, strategizing across the ecology to create new businesses and applications, and developing public policies to embrace ambiguity. Using examples from biopharmaceuticals and alternative energy, we develop specific organizing ideas that can be examined and elaborated upon. This new direction for organization science integrates existing ideas around a new kind of organizing and shows how organization science can add real value in addressing major challenges of public welfare and safety in the 21st century.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0605","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['public welfare', 'innovation', 'knowledge capabilities', 'public policies']","The article discusses the importance of organizing for innovation in sectors that impact public welfare, suggesting a focus on societal benefits rather than solely on profit.

This fluidity engenders a dynamic flow of resources in and out of the community\u2014resources such as passion, time, identity, social disembodiment of ideas, socially ambiguous identities, and temporary convergence. With each resource comes both a negative and positive consequence, creating a tension that fluctuates with changes in the resource.

However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory\u2014for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol.78(6) 1360\u20131380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition. Havard University Press, Cambridge, MA], to identify characteristic elements of network theorizing. We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0641","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on clarifying network theory and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

However, when the performance of an organization in a brokerage position deviates from its aspirations, the organization changes its partner selection strategy and starts initiating ties to partners of similar status.

New Consumer Practices and Change in Organizational Fields","While scholars have provided increasingly well-developed theoretical frameworks for understanding the role of institutional entrepreneurs and other purposeful actors in bringing about change in organizational fields, much less attention has been paid to the role of unorganized, nonstrategic actors in catalyzing change. In particular, the role of consumers remains largely uninvestigated. In this article, we draw on a case of the introduction of text messaging in the United Kingdom to explore the role of consumers in catalyzing change in organizational fields. Text messaging has become a widely diffused and institutionalized communication practice, in part changing mobile telephony from a voice-based, aural, and synchronous experience to a text-based, visual, and asynchronous experience. As consumers innovated and diffused new practices around this product, their actions led to significant changes in the field. We suggest how and under what conditions consumers are likely to innovate at the micro level and, with the subsequent involvement of other actors, catalyze change at the field level. Our primary contribution is to show how the cumulative effect of the spontaneous activities of one important and particularly dispersed and unorganized group can lead to changes in a field. By showing how change can result from the uncoordinated actions of consumers accumulating and converging over time, we provide an alternative explanation of change in organizational fields that does not privilege purposeful actors such as institutional entrepreneurs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0595","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['consumers', 'change', 'innovation', 'organizational fields']","The article discusses the role of consumers in catalyzing change within organizational fields, which touches on themes of agency and innovation.

To overcome these challenges, such research suggests that firms establish organizational separation between exploring and exploiting units or engage in temporal separation whereby they oscillate between exploration and exploitation over time. Nevertheless, these approaches entail resource allocation trade-offs and conflicting organizational routines, which may undermine organizational performance as firms seek to balance exploration and exploitation within a discrete field of organizational activity (i.e., domain). We posit that firms can overcome such impediments and enhance their performance if they explore in one domain while exploiting in another. Studying the alliance portfolios of software firms, we demonstrate that firms do not typically benefit from balancing exploration and exploitation within the function domain (technology versus marketing and production alliances) and structure domain (new versus prior partners). Nevertheless, firms that balance exploration and exploitation across these domains by engaging in research and development alliances while collaborating with their prior partners, or alternatively, by forming marketing and production alliances while seeking new partners, gain in profits and market value. Moreover, we reveal that increases in firm size that exacerbate resource allocation trade-offs and routine rigidity reinforce the benefits of balance across domains and the costs of balance within domains. Our domain separation approach offers new insights into how firms can benefit from balancing exploration and exploitation. What matters is not simply whether firms balance exploration and exploitation in their alliance formation decisions but the means by which they achieve such balance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1100.0596","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['exploration', 'exploitation', 'organizational performance']","The article primarily focuses on organizational performance and strategic management concepts without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We test this theoretical proposition by examining patterns of product valuation in the California premium wine market. Our findings show that when an individual wine's tasting score rated by critics and another more general status indicator\u2014classified appellation affiliation, extra designation on the label, or a winery's organizational status\u2014are consistently positive, each makes a greater contribution to wine price.

The literature offers insights to help explain this phenomenon. Evidence suggests that, while carefully considering the purchase cost, managers often underestimate the costs and planning necessary for proper implementation. Consequently, short-term problems arise and long-term benefits are not realized. A model is introduced that integrates workforce knowledge management with the technology upgrade decision. The manager upgrades technology or pursues general training of the workforce in response to depreciation in the ability of each resource to drive net income over time. Depreciation occurs because of changes in consumer preferences and competition. Although adding to technology capability, an upgrade makes a portion of workforce knowledge obsolete. The manager invests in preparatory training prior to the upgrade to reduce obsolescence. Whereas general training is pursued to respond to depreciation by enhancing the ability of the workforce to improve existing products or create new products, preparatory training is technology-specific and focused on preparing for a technology upgrade. We find that the rates of preparatory and general training follow entirely different paths over time. Conditions are given where a manager uses one training strategy as a substitute for or complement to the other. We show that training strategies are not only impacted by learning phenomena such as the rate of forgetting, but also by the rates of technology depreciation and advancement.

Yet little research has focused on how these online communities sustain themselves and how their interactions are structured. In this paper, we theorize and empirically measure the network exchange patterns of long-duration sustainable online communities. We propose that participation dynamics follow specific forms of social exchange: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, and preferential attachment. We integrate diverse findings about individual participation motivations by identifying how individual behavior manifests in network-level structures of online communities. We studied five online communities over 27 months and analyzed 38,483 interactions using exponential random graph (p*) models and mixed-effects analysis of covariance. In a test of competing models, we found that network exchange patterns in online community communication networks are characterized by direct reciprocity and indirect reciprocity patterns and, surprisingly, a tendency away from preferential attachment. Our findings undermine previous explanations that online exchange follows a power law distribution based on people wanting to connect to \u201cpopular\u201d others in online communities.

Citations to each compendium are, however, clustered within particular journals and among authors with particular university affiliations\u2014but neither the journals nor universities are neatly North American or European. Current associations of these traditions with North American and European scholarship thus seem driven more by academic rhetoric than authentic continental distinctions.

In this paper, I propose that attention to the extent of competence destruction is necessary but not sufficient. An analysis of differences in R&D performance through a discontinuity requires assessment not only of old competence destruction but also of new competence access; that is, it requires assessment of both old capability obsolescence and new capability acquisition. I find evidence for this proposition in data from the biotechnology disruption to the anticancer drug market. In particular, my research design is a within-market matched pair of discontinuities: from chemotherapy to small-molecule targeted drugs, and from chemotherapy to large-molecule targeted drugs. Although equally competence destroying, the two discontinuities differ in the access incumbents have to the new capabilities required: whereas all new capabilities are available in the former, one new capability is inaccessible to incumbents (and to many entrants) in the latter. The contrasting results of these two discontinuities support my proposition: in the competence-destroying discontinuity with full access to new capabilities, incumbents did not fall behind entrants; in the other discontinuity, incumbents fell behind only those entrants that owned the difficult-to-access new capability.

However, current models of team process are insensitive to the effects of team strategic orientation. This paper expands existing work on team process and strategic orientation to introduce and explicate the constructs of offensive and defensive strategic orientations in teams. It takes advantage of a rare opportunity to observe eight counterterrorism teams in the intelligence community that explicitly adopted an offensive or defensive strategic orientation in evaluating terrorist threats. The resulting inductive model suggests that the strength of a team's strategic orientation was enhanced or inhibited by its perception of oppositional strength and the problem scope it assumed in confronting the adversary. This in turn had effects on the work strategy the teams adopted, the extent to which they relied on internal versus external knowledge, and the norms for effort that evolved within the teams.

The relationship between performance and risk taking has been studied mostly across such periods but rarely within them. Building on the shifting-focus-of-attention model of organizational risk taking, we argue that the temporal proximity of deadlines regulates the focus of organizational attention within a performance period. Decision makers will focus their attention on attaining and maintaining aspirations early in a period; however, as deadlines approach, decision makers in underperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on ensuring survival, whereas decision makers in outperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on experimenting with slack resources. We propose that the relationship between performance and risk taking should thus be moderated by deadline proximity within a performance period. We tested and found support for our hypotheses in the context of 22,603 fourth-down decisions made by the 32 National Football League teams during the 2000\u20132005 regular season games.

We also demonstrate that the existence of lower off\u2010contract prices is not, per se, evidence of anticompetitive behavior on the part of GPOs. Indeed, we demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, the presence of a GPO lowers off\u2010contract prices.

How does the information about the small supplier's production cost affect the profits and contracting decision? How does the existence of the small supplier affect profits? By studying various information scenarios regarding the small supplier's and the manufacturer's production cost, we show, for example, that the big supplier benefits when the small supplier keeps its production cost private. We quantify the value of information for the big supplier and the manufacturer. We also quantify the cost (value) of the alternative\u2010sourcing option for the big supplier (the manufacturer).

In this context, product manufacturers set their wholesale prices so as to obtain larger shelf space allocations but at the same time keep margins as high as possible. We analyze the equilibrium situation in the supply chain, and find that generally the retailer's and the suppliers' incentives are misaligned, resulting in suboptimal retail prices and shelf space allocations.

Advance selling helps retailers to reduce demand uncertainty. Consumers, however, may prefer not to purchase in advance unless given a discount because they are uncertain about their valuation for the product in advance. It is then unclear whether or when advance selling to pass some uncertainty risk to consumers is optimal for the retailer. This paper examines the advance selling price and inventory decisions in a two\u2010period setting, where the first period is the advance selling period and the second is the selling (and consumption) period. We find that an advance selling strategy is not always optimal, but is contingent on parameters of the market (e.g., market potential and uncertainty) and the consumers (e.g., valuation, risk aversion, and heterogeneity). For example, we find that retailers should sell in advance if the consumers' expected valuation exceeds consumers' expected surplus when not buying early by a certain threshold. This threshold increases with the degree of risk aversion but decreases with stock out risk. If the degree of risk aversion varies across consumers, then a retailer should sell in advance if the probability for a consumer to spot buy is less than a critical fractile.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01133.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advance selling strategies in retail without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a number of common demand distributions, as well as the distribution\u2010free approximation, we compare the centralized (pooled) system with the decentralized (non\u2010pooled) system. We investigate the sensitivity of the absolute and relative reduction in costs to the variability of demand and to the number of locations (facilities) being pooled. We show that for the distributions considered, the absolute benefit of risk pooling increases with variability, and the relative benefit stays fairly constant, as long as the coefficient of variation of demand stays in the low range. However, under high\u2010variability conditions, both measures decrease to zero as the demand variability is increased. We show, through analytical results and computational experiments, that these effects are due to the different operating regimes exhibited by the system under different levels of variability: as the variability is increased, the system switches from the normal operation to the effective and then complete shutdown regimes; the decrease in the benefits of risk pooling is associated with the two latter stages. The centralization allows the system to remain in the normal operation regime under higher levels of variability compared to the decentralized system.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01134.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Our model suggests that the choice of product architecture depends on firm, market, and product characteristics in addition to supply chain structure. In contrast to other studies, we find that the optimal mapping from architecture to supply chain structure is not always one\u2010to\u2010one. A decentralized supply chain may be associated with a more integral product when the technical collaboration penalty is not excessive and suppliers have significantly superior product development capabilities. Furthermore, in a decentralized supply chain, the nature of the relationship between the original equipment manufacturer and its supplier (adversarial or collaborative) plays a role in the choice of product architecture: modular architectures are more likely when the parties have adversarial relationships, while long\u2010term trust\u2010based relationships facilitate more integral product architectures.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01136.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['supply chain', 'collaboration', 'relationship']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of product architecture and supply chain configuration without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This paper analyzes its implications for category management. We consider a model where two competing manufacturers sell their differentiated products through a single retailer who determines the shelf space allocated to the category. The scope of category management is pricing. We consider two category management mechanisms: retailer category management (RCM), where the retailer determines product prices and category captainship (CC), where a manufacturer in the category determines them. Our analysis reveals that the retailer can use the form of category management and the category shelf space to control the intensity of competition between manufacturers to his benefit. We also show that the emergence of CC depends on the degree of product differentiation, the opportunity cost of shelf space, and the profit sharing arrangement in the alliance. The equilibrium category shelf space under CC may be higher than under RCM if the value to the retailer of eliminating double marginalization and putting price pressure on the non\u2010captain manufacturer dominates the loss from sharing the profit with the category captain. CC has been criticized for disadvantaging non\u2010captain manufacturers. While we provide some support for this claim, we also find that CC may benefit non\u2010captain manufacturers when implemented by a powerful retailer in categories with sufficiently differentiated products, because the shelf space allocated to the category increases in this case.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01141.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['category management', 'shelf space', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of category management and competition in the retail space, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Each retailer has private information about uncertain demand. The manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader who sets the contract terms with the retailers, and benefits from retailers sharing their private information. When all retailers are given the same wholesale price, truthful information sharing is not an equilibrium outcome. We propose two variants of differential pricing mechanisms that induce truthful information sharing by all retailers. The first variant rewards a retailer for providing optimistic information and achieves truthful information sharing as a unique equilibrium. The differential pricing mechanism is optimal in the class of linear\u2010price, incentive\u2010compatible, direct mechanisms. The second variant, which incorporates provision for a fixed payment in addition to wholesale prices, preserves all the equilibrium properties of the first variant and additionally \u201cnearly coordinates\u201d the supply chain. Our analysis of differential pricing with a fixed payment provides interesting observations regarding the relationship between product substitutability, number of retailers, information precision, and market power.

As the price decreases with the total quantity, buyers receive lower prices than they otherwise would be able to obtain individually. Previous studies on group buying focus on the benefit buyers receive in reduced acquisition costs or enhanced bargaining power. In this paper, we show that buyers can instead get hurt from such cooperation. Specifically, we consider a two\u2010level distribution channel with a single manufacturer and two retailers who compete for end customers. We show that, under linear demand curves, group buying is always preferable for symmetric (i.e., identical) retailers. For asymmetric retailers (i.e., differing in market base and/or efficiency), group buying is beneficial to the smaller (or less efficient) player. However, it can be detrimental to the larger (or more efficient) one. Despite the lower wholesale price under group buying, the manufacturer can receive a higher revenue. Interestingly, group buying is more likely to form when retailers are competitive in different dimensions. These insights are shown to be robust under general nonlinear demand curves, except for constant elastic demand with low demand elasticity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01173.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of group buying and its economic implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The buyer chooses to offer a push or pull contract, for which the single price and winning supplier are determined via the auction. We show that, with a pull contract, the buyer does not necessarily benefit from a larger number of suppliers participating in the auction, due to the negative effect of supplier competition on the incentive of supplier capacity investment. We thus propose an enhanced pull mechanism that mitigates this effect with a floor price. We then analyze and compare the outcomes of auctions for push and (enhanced) pull contracts, establishing when one form is preferred over the other based on the buyer's profits.

Underlying objectives, which are obtained via factor analysis, include the focus on price, security of supply, internal procurement efficiencies, and bundle building. Next, cluster analysis is used to derive prototypical strategic approaches. The three cluster groups that emerge possess the same relative ranking of the four objectives, but differ based on the intensity with which these objectives are pursued. The clusters are labelled as the three strategic groups of strategists, opportunists, and responders. The research then explores, using an industrial buyer behavior lens, the impact of environmental antecedents in determining a particular strategy. Environmental variables include purchase importance, market uncertainty, supply base availability, buyer bargaining power, item experience, and supply base experience. Finally, the study tests the impact of procurement strategy on the buyer's perceived performance, suggesting that strategists, placing more emphasis on the pursuit of strategic sourcing objectives, achieve better performance than opportunists and responders.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01175.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on procurement strategies and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider two types of uncertainty: information asymmetry, defined as the payer's uncertainty about mean demand; and market uncertainty, defined as both parties' uncertainty about true demand. We investigate the optimal contract design in the presence of asymmetric information. We find that an incentive compatible contract always exists; that the optimal price is decreasing in expected market size, while the rebate may be increasing or decreasing in expected market size; that the optimal contract for a manufacturer with the highest possible demand would include no rebate; and, in a special case, if the average reservation profit is non\u2010decreasing in expected market size, then the optimal contract includes no rebates for all manufacturers.

Despite the potential importance of this issue, we find surprisingly few studies that look at how the allocation of capacity, paired with various appointment scheduling policies and different patient flow configurations, affects patient flow and clinical efficiency. In this paper, we develop an empirically based discrete\u2010event simulation to examine the interactions between patient appointment policies and capacity allocation policies (i.e., the number of available examination rooms) and how they jointly affect various performance measures, such as resource utilization and patient waiting time. Findings suggest that scheduling lower\u2010variance, shorter appointments earlier in the clinic (and, conversely, higher\u2010variance, longer appointments later) results in less overall patient waiting without reducing physician utilization or increasing clinic duration. Additionally, exam rooms exhibited classic bottleneck behavior: there was no effect on physician utilization by adding exam rooms beyond a certain threshold, but too few exam rooms were devastating to clinic throughput. Some significant interactions between these variables were observed, but were not influential to the level of managerial concern. Clinicians' intuition about managing capacity in healthcare settings may differ substantially from best policies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01220.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and capacity management in healthcare without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Currently there are two major gateways for admission to a hospital: the ED and scheduled elective admission. Unfortunately, in highly utilized hospitals, excessive wait times make the scheduled gateway undesirable or infeasible for a subset of patients and doctors. As a result, this group often uses the ED gateway as a means to gain admission to the hospital.

First, a discrete event simulation model is used to evaluate how 12 different sequencing and patient appointment time\u2010setting heuristics perform with respect to the competing criteria of expected patient waiting time and expected surgical suite overtime for a single day compared with current practice. Second, a bi\u2010criteria genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine if better solutions can be obtained for this single day scheduling problem. Third, we investigate the efficacy of the bi\u2010criteria GA when surgeries are allowed to be moved to other days. We present numerical experiments based on real data from a large health care provider.

Yet, the majority of customers are still dissatisfied with the way firms resolve their complaints. Can learning to reduce service failures reduce customer dissatisfaction, and to what extent are such reductions sustainable? Previous research showed that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction (i) follow a U\u2010shaped function of operating experience and (ii) are heterogeneous across firms. In this paper, I tease out where the U\u2010shaped learning\u2010curve effect and learning\u2010curve heterogeneity originate: service failure or customers' propensity to complain with a third party given the occurrence of a service failure. Using quarterly data for nine major US airlines over 11 years, I find that the U\u2010shaped learning\u2010curve effect and the learning\u2010curve heterogeneity originate in the propensity to complain. In the long term, reductions in service failure did not translate in sustainable reductions in customer dissatisfaction. Customers' propensity to complain eventually went up. Managing the propensity to complain provides more opportunity for a firm to distinguish itself from competitors.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01149.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['customer dissatisfaction', 'service failure', 'organizational learning']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and customer service management without addressing social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

We model the effect of such incentives under two specific scenarios: an exclusive dealership selling a single product and a non\u2010exclusive dealer selling two competing products. For an exclusive dealer, we show that a bonus contract not only increases the expected sales, but, more importantly, decreases the sales (order) variance.

Product managers often have to choose between introducing an incrementally better, safe new product early and a superior, yet highly risky, product later. Recommendations for managing such performance vs. time\u2010to\u2010market trade\u2010offs often ignore competitive reactions to development decisions. In this paper, we study how a firm could incorporate the presence of a strategic competitor in making technology selection and investment decisions regarding new products. We consider a model in which an innovating firm and its rival can introduce a new product immediately or pursue a more advanced product for later launch. Further, the firm can reduce the uncertainty surrounding product development by dedicating more resources; the effectiveness of this investment depends on the firm's innovative capacity. Our model generates two sets of insights. First, in highly competitive industries, firms can adopt different technologies and effectively use introduction timing to mitigate the effects of price competition. More importantly, the firm could strategically invest in the advanced product to influence its rival's technology choice. We characterize equilibrium development and investment decisions of the firms, and derive innovative capacity hurdles that govern a firm's choice between the risky and safe alternatives.

The heterogeneous nature of loss is identified to be a key factor for the effectiveness of the liability mechanism. On the other hand, patch release can be effective and welfare\u2010enhancing regardless of the nature of loss as long as customers incur low patching cost, and/or the vendor incurs low patch development cost.

The substitution model we consider combines the usual supplier\u2010driven and customer\u2010driven schemes, in that the supplier may choose to offer substitution, at a discount price, or may choose not to; whereas the customer may or may not accept the substitution when it is offered. The supplier's decisions are the supply and substitution rules in each period throughout the season, and the replenishment quantities for both products at the beginning of the season. With a stochastic dynamic programming formulation, we first prove the concavity of the value function, which facilitates the solution to the optimal replenishment quantities. We then show that the optimal substitution follows a threshold rule, and establish the monotonicity of the thresholds over time and with respect to key cost parameters.

Here we analyze the joint shelf space allocation and inventory decisions for multiple items with demand that depends on both factors. The traditional approach to solve inventory models with a state\u2010dependent demand rate uses a time domain approach. However, this approach often does not lead to closed\u2010form expressions for the profit rate with both dependencies. We analyze the problem in the inventory domain via level crossing theory. This approach leads to closed\u2010form expressions for a large set of demand rate functions exhibiting both dependencies. These closed\u2010form expressions substantially simplify the search for optimal solutions; thus we use them to solve the joint inventory control and shelf space allocation problem. We consider examples with two products to investigate the significance of capturing both demand dependencies. We show that in some settings it is important to capture both dependencies. We consider two heuristics, each one of them ignores one of the two dependencies. Using these heuristics it seems that ignoring the dependency on the shelf space might be less harmful than ignoring the dependency on the inventory level, which, based on computational results, can lead to profit losses of more than 6%.

We address key market and operating factors that make one scheme preferable to the other from the viewpoints of recyclers, manufacturers, and consumers. To this end, we model competitive decision making in both take\u2010back schemes as two\u2010stage sequential games between competing manufacturers and recyclers. Deriving and computing equilibria, we find that the competitive take\u2010back scheme often accomplishes a win\u2013win situation, that is, lower product prices, and higher recycler and manufacturer profits. Exceptionally, recyclers prefer the monopolistic scheme when the substitutability level between the manufacturers' original products is high or economies of scale in recycling are very strong. We show that consolidation of the recycling industry could benefit all stakeholders when the economies of scale in recycling are strong, provided that manufacturer's products are not highly substitutable. Higher collection rates also render recycler consolidation desirable for all stakeholders. We also identify a potential free rider problem in the monopolistic scheme when recyclers differ in operational efficiency, and propose mechanisms to eliminate the discrepancy. We show that our results and insights are robust to the degree of competition within the recycling industry.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01207.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['recycling', 'stakeholders', 'sustainability']","The article discusses recycling schemes and their impact on various stakeholders, indicating some awareness of sustainability issues.

Suppliers may form alliances, and each alliance then sells a kit of components to the assembler and determines the price for that kit. The assembler buys the components (kits) from the alliances and sets the selling price of the product. Nagarajan and So\u0161i\u0107 consider three modes of competition\u2014supplier Stackelberg, vertical Nash (VN), and assembler Stackelberg models\u2014which correspond to different power structures in the market, and study stable supplier alliances when the assembler faces linear and isoelastic demand. In this paper, we study the impact that demand uncertainty has on stability results obtained in Nagarajan and So\u0161i\u0107. We first analyze models in which all decisions are made before the uncertainty is resolved, and show that the alliance of all suppliers remains stable when demand is isoelastic, or under Stackelberg models when demand is linear. However, demand uncertainty may change stability results when both parties make decisions simultaneously (VN model) and demand is linear. We then extend our results by considering scenarios in which some decisions may be postponed and made after the actual demand is known. When the ordering quantity can be determined after observing the true demand, we show that stable outcomes correspond to those obtained in the deterministic case and uncertainty has no impact on coalition stability; if only the assembler's pricing decision is postponed, we need additional conditions for stability results to carry over in the additive demand model.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01208.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and does not address any socially progressive themes or issues related to diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2011","20","6","Corinne MacDonald corinne.macdonald@dal.ca and Eldon A.

Our results indicate that unscheduled visits to the facility's laboratory or X\u2010ray services have the largest impact on a physician's idle time.

The retailer might need to borrow money from a bank to execute his order. The bank offers a fairly priced loan for relevant risks. Failure of loan repayment leads to a costly bankruptcy (fixed administrative costs, costs proportional to sales, and a depressed collateral value). We identify the retailer's optimal order quantity as a function of the wholesale price and his total wealth (working capital and collateral). The analysis of the supplier's optimal wholesale price problem as a Stackelberg game, with the supplier the leader and the retailer the follower, leads to unique equilibrium solutions in wholesale price and order quantity, with the equilibrium order quantity smaller than the traditional newsvendor one. Furthermore, in the presence of the retailer's bankruptcy risks, increases in the retailer's wealth lead to increased supplier's wholesale prices, but without the retailer's bankruptcy risks the supplier's wholesale prices stay the same or decrease in retailer's wealth.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01211.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and financial constraints without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, recent revenue management (RM) research has demonstrated what appear to be systematic deviations from normative models of decision making. These deviations can even be observed in relatively simple RM contexts. We suggest that technical errors in capacity allocation decisions are linked to issues such as arousal and stress associated with state conditions of RM tasks. Our study goes beyond existing findings by considering behavioral phenomena in concurrent task settings, where the decision maker is faced with managing decisions for more than one product or service. Physiological measures of eye dilation and blink rate are used as markers of arousal and stress in subjects engaged in RM tasks. Our analysis shows that physiological responses are indeed associated with both the state conditions of RM tasks and the number of capacity blocks managed concurrently by an individual. Deviations from modeled decision making appear to be significantly dependent upon these physiological responses. We conclude with a discussion of implications for further research and practice.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2010.01213.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and decision-making processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a model of demand cannibalization and a behavioral study that estimates a key modeling parameter: a fraction of consumers who switch from new to remanufactured product. As we show, this fraction has an inverted\u2010U shape, and, thus, the underlying consumer behavior cannot be modeled using the standard methodologies that rely on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). We find that by incorporating the inverted\u2010U\u2010shaped consumer behavior, the firm remanufactures under broader conditions, charges a much lower price, and typically remanufactures more units\u2014leading to an increase of profits from remanufacturing by up to a factor of two as compared with making decisions based on the WTP only.

The disadvantage is that the firm loses the revenue from the software. The advantage is that the users' network can contribute to the quality of the software code, which increases the demand for the software and for a complementary product. Demand for the complementary product also goes up, because demand for a product increases when the price of its complement decreases, and under open source, the price of the software product drops down to zero. This paper examines the strategic interactions at work here, within a duopoly framework, and tries to determine the circumstances under which it is optimal for a firm to open its code. We find that firms open the source code when there is a competitive software\u2010product market, a less competitive complementary\u2010product market, and when the complementary product is of high quality. Furthermore, it is more profitable for the firm to open the source code if its competitor also does so. When this happens the incentive to open the code can even be higher than in a monopoly situation. More intense competition induces symmetric equilibria in which both firms choose the same strategy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01233.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic business decisions related to source code and market competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this research, we identify characteristics of transfer prices that achieve the firm\u2010wide optimal solution.

We determine that a cost allocation mechanism that allocates a portion of the initial production cost to each of the two stages of the product life cycle should be used.

We show that endogenous trading by small bondholders may result in multiple equilibria. Some equilibria entail vanishing liquidity and sharp increases in yields absent changing fundamentals. In turn, anticipation of illiquid equilibria induces firms to eschew public debt financing, since such equilibria create higher bankruptcy costs and debt illiquidity discounts. The model thus offers a rational micro-foundation for stylized facts commonly attributed to investor sentiment and CFO market timing. Finally, we show that the vulnerability of debt markets to multiple equilibria is highest during downturns, when small bondholders face severe adverse selection.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/10/3369/1593179","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt market liquidity and financial mechanisms without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or progressive themes.

In most developed markets, a firm's stock price moves much more on days with public news about the firm. In contrast, in many emerging markets volatility is similar on news and non-news days. We examine several hypotheses for our findings. Cross-country differences in stock price reactions are best explained by insider trading, followed by differences in the quality of the news dissemination mechanism.

Signaling incentives distort the timing of exercise, and the direction of distortion depends on whether the decision-maker's utility increases or decreases in outsiders' belief about the payoff from exercise. In the former case, signaling incentives erode the value of the option to wait and speed up option exercise, while in the latter case option exercise is delayed.

A Look Beneath the SurfaceGet access","We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, do VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: The efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/12/4037/1573269","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the efficiency gains from venture capital financing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Inferences from Risk-adjusted PayGet access","We compute and compare risk-adjusted CEO pay in the United States and United Kingdom, where the risk adjustment is based on estimated risk premiums stemming from the equity incentives borne by CEOs. Controlling for firm and industry characteristics, we find that U.S. CEOs have higher pay, but also bear much higher stock and option incentives than U.K. CEOs. Using reasonable estimates of risk premiums, we find that risk-adjusted U.S. CEO pay does not appear to be large compared to that of U.K. CEOs. We also examine differences in pay and equity incentives between a sample of non-U.K. European CEOs and a matched sample of U.S. CEOs, and find that risk-adjusting pay may explain about half of the apparent higher pay for U.S. CEOs.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/2/402/1581556","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of CEO compensation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that higher pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) leads to value-enhancing acquisitions. Banks whose CEOs have higher PPS have significantly better abnormal stock returns around the time of the acquisition announcements. On average, acquirers in the high-PPS group outperform their counterparts in the low-PPS group by 1.4% in a three-day window around the announcement. Higher PPS helps reduce the incentives for making value-destroying acquisitions, while at the same time promotes value-enhancing acquisitions. The positive market reaction can be rationalized by post-merger performance. Following acquisitions, banks with higher PPS experience greater improvements in their operating performance. We show that the effect of PPS is mainly evident in small and medium-sized banks, but is not present in large banks.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/2/439/1581375","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial incentives and their impact on acquisition decisions in the banking industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We also find that impatient trading is more important for growth-oriented funds, and liquidity provision is more important for younger income funds.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/3/675/1589898","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and trading strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2011","24","3","Prachi Deuskar\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Prachi Deuskar\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Timothy C.

The first component\u2014flow-driven risk\u2014is large, accounting for approximately 50% of market variance, and it is not transient. This risk represents the joint effect of net trade demand and the price impact of that demand\u2014i.e., illiquidity. We find that flows are largely unpredictable, and lagged flows have no price impact. Flow-driven risk is time varying because price impact is highly variable. Illiquidity rises with market volatility, but not with flow uncertainty. Net selling increases illiquidity, which amplifies downside flow-driven risk. The findings are consistent with flow-driven shocks resulting from fluctuations in aggregate risk-bearing capacity. Under this interpretation, investors with constant risk tolerance should trade against such shocks (i.e., \u201csupply liquidity\u201d) to achieve substantial utility gains. Quantitatively accounting for the scale of flow-driven risk poses a major challenge for asset pricing theory.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/3/721/1591278","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market liquidity and risk without any mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This result is not explained away by differences in observable borrower quality, geographical location of the property, or the cost of capital of high- and low-OTD banks.

We also describe the dynamics of credit line violations and the outcome of subsequent renegotiations. We show how companies substitute between credit lines and internal liquidity (cash and profits) when facing a severe credit shortage. Looking at real-side decisions, we find that credit lines are associated with greater spending when companies are not cash-strapped.

When banks have relative expertise in employing risky assets, the market for these assets clears only at fire-sale prices following a large number of bank failures. The gains from acquiring assets at fire-sale prices make it attractive for banks to hold liquid assets. The resulting choice of bank liquidity is countercyclical, inefficiently low during economic booms but excessively high during crises. We present evidence consistent with these predictions. While interventions to resolve banking crises may be desirable ex post, they affect bank liquidity in subtle ways: Liquidity support to failed banks or unconditional support to surviving banks reduces incentives to hold liquidity, whereas support to surviving banks conditional on their liquid asset holdings has the opposite effect.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/6/2166/1583798","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bank liquidity and financial crises without addressing any social justice themes, ethical critiques, or diversity issues.

In industries where value creation depends on innovation and development of new products, mergers are likely to be inefficient even though they increase the market power of the post-merger firm. In such industries, a stand-alone structure where independent firms compete both in the product market and in the market for employee human capital leads to a greater profitability. Furthermore, our analysis shows that multidivisional firms can improve employee incentives and increase firm value by reducing firm size through a spinoff transaction, although doing so eliminates the economies of scale advantage of being a larger firm and the benefits of operating an internal capital market within the firm. Finally, our article suggests that established firms can benefit from creating their own competition in the product and labor markets by accommodating new firm entry, and the desire to do so is greater at the intermediate stages of industry/product development.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/7/2207/1625594","articles","RFS","Finance","2","['employee incentives', 'innovation', 'market competition']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of mergers and their impact on employee incentives and innovation, with no significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Further, some of our results differ from the extant literature. For example, the finding that mergers occur in waves is attenuated with a greater presence of smaller and/or non-public firms.

However, most firms are held by multiple small blockholders. This article shows that, while such a structure generates free-rider problems that hinder intervention, the same coordination difficulties strengthen a second governance mechanism: disciplining the manager through trading. Since multiple blockholders cannot coordinate to limit their orders and maximize combined trading profits, they trade competitively, impounding more information into prices. This strengthens the threat of disciplinary trading, inducing higher managerial effort. The optimal blockholder structure depends on the relative effectiveness of manager and blockholder effort, the complementarities in their outputs, information asymmetry, liquidity, monitoring costs, and the manager's contract.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/7/2395/1625435","articles","RFS","Finance","2","['governance', 'blockholders', 'managerial effort']","The article primarily focuses on governance structures and trading mechanisms without addressing any social justice, equity, or ethical concerns.

Our results indicate that bank relationships formed through repeated interactions reduce inefficiencies from information asymmetry and allow leveraged buyouts sponsored by private equity firms to occur on favorable loan terms. A one-standard-deviation increase in bank relationship strength is associated with an 8-basis-point (3%) decrease in the spread and a 0.21-basis-point (4%) increase in the maximum debt to EBITDA covenant. We also find evidence that banks price loans to cross-sell other fee business. A one-standard-deviation increase in both bank relationship strength and cross-selling potential translates into as much as a 4-percentage-point increase in equity return to the leveraged buyout firm.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/7/2462/1626498","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of leveraged buyouts and bank relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article investigates the performance consequences of risk shifting and sheds light on the mechanisms and the economic motivations behind risk-shifting behavior.

We show that CDS, and the empty creditors they give rise to, have important ex ante commitment benefits: By strengthening creditors' bargaining power, they raise the debtor's pledgeable income and help reduce the incidence of strategic default. However, we also show that lenders will over-insure in equilibrium, giving rise to an inefficiently high incidence of costly bankruptcy.

The strength of incentives depends only on the disutility of effort and is independent of risk and risk aversion.

Much of the more recent research has demonstrated that dividend policy becomes important in the presence of taxation, asymmetric information, incomplete contracts, institutional constraints, and transaction costs. By examining the effects of dividend policies on 475 British firms existing between 1895 and 1905, and consequently operating in an environment of very low taxation with an absence of institutional constraints, we find strong support for asymmetric information theories of dividend policy, and little support for agency models.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/24/9/2935/1567655","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dividend policies and financial theories without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

These allocations of information have implications for price informativeness and trading volume, and thus we suggest a direct link between properties of asset prices and financial intermediation.

In this paper, I empirically test the link between added value and value capture using a longitudinal dataset of United Kingdom law firm performance, capabilities, and client relationships. In this setting, competitors relevant for defining a firm's added value are those that share a client with the firm. Further, within a client relationship, value creation, and hence added value, can be decomposed in two parts: product-line capability and client-specific scope economies. I find that added value, measured at the level of each buyer-supplier relationship, is a driver of relationship stability and supplier profitability. This suggests that suppliers with similar capabilities might enjoy different economic returns depending on the composition of their set of relevant competitors. These findings shed light on the conditions under which firms can appropriate returns from their capabilities. They indicate that concepts from cooperative games can be fruitfully applied to empirical studies of firm performance and to the elaboration of insights from the resource-based view of the firm.

Our interest is in the strategies that allow incumbents to be successful in this endeavor during the infancy of an emerging field\u2014the period before it is clear how the field will affect dominant designs. Our evidence counters the stereotypical view that incumbent firms play a passive role in major technological changes by adhering to incremental inventions in the existing dominant designs.

The relative effects of cooperative and noncooperative behavior","Are joint ventures (JVs) characterized mainly by cooperative behavior or noncooperative behavior? In this research, we address this question by examining the interrelationship between the values created for two partners when they announce a JV. We argue that, on average, if cooperative behavior and common benefits are more influential than noncooperative behavior and private benefits, there will be a positive association between the values created for the two partners. Conversely, if private benefits and noncooperative behavior are more influential, there will be a negative association as partners derive value at the expense of each other rather than by creating new opportunities through the JV. Using a sample of 344 JVs we find evidence of a positive association between the values created for the two partners after controlling for various factors. This suggests that the stock market perceives JVs to be positive sum games rather than zero sum games, and that value creation in JVs is mainly attributable to synergies rather than appropriation of resources. Our analysis also reveals other conditions under which cooperative behavior and noncooperative behavior become dominant, such as the strength of the resources of the two partners, product market competition, and JV experience.

To examine these differences, it is necessary to distinguish risk taking from rigidity in the strategic position, which is accomplished by separate analysis of the amount of resource acquisition and the difference of acquired and existing resources.

Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000\u20132002 confirms our hypotheses.

When firms have limited access to external capital, they have to rely on internally generated funds for these investments. In this case, their strategic investments are constrained by cash flow. I predict that by geographically diversifying sales (i.e., exporting), firms can relax this constraint because exporting signals more stable expected cash flows and firm quality, which can increase external capital providers' willingness to fund investments. Examining a representative sample of Spanish manufacturers from 1990 to 1998, I find support that exporting mitigates investment liquidity constraints allowing firms to make strategic investments they would not otherwise be able to make. This highlights how diversification can be a strategy to create and maintain competitive advantage.

Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough.

Frictions arise from search and switching costs and moderate the intensity of industry rivalry and the efficiency of the market. We find that firms with a competitive advantage prefer industries with less, but not zero, frictions. We show that rivalry interacts nontrivially with other competitive forces to affect industry attractiveness. Firm heterogeneity emerges naturally when we introduce resource development. Heterogeneity falls with frictions, but the sustainability of competitive advantage increases. Overall, we show that introducing frictions makes value-based models very effective at integrating analyses at the industry, firm, and resource levels.

We propose that the formal and informal institution context in \u2018red\u2019 states (those dominated by the U.S. Republican Party) is more aligned with the principal strategies through which leveraged buyout investors create value than such a context is in \u2018blue\u2019 states (those dominated by the Democratic Party). Therefore, according to institutional theory, one would expect, ceteris paribus, a higher likelihood of buyout transactions in red states and vice versa. We analyze a sample of 10,746 U.S. buyout investments in 4,633 distinct target companies made by 2,396 different funds managed by 1,300 private equity firms from 1980 to 2003.

We hypothesize that, owing to several forms of group-level effects including market power, efficiency, differentiation, and multimarket contact, strategic groups that comprise smaller firms will exhibit both increased rivalry and decreased performance compared with strategic groups that comprise larger firms. We test our hypotheses by estimating the effect of group-level strategic interactions (i.e., conjectural variations) on firm performance. Ultimately, our analysis of empirical data on loans in the Spanish banking industry demonstrates that increased rivalry and decreased performance indeed characterizes firms belonging to a strategic group that comprises smaller firms.

Prospective entrants learn about the attractiveness of alternative locations by observing the entry choices of previous investors (\u2018models\u2019). We distinguish two types of learning that differ in observational focus width but can and do operate simultaneously. With assessment learning, firms judge the economic feasibility and agglomeration benefits of entering a location by observing and following a broad set of models. With bandwagon learning, firm-level uncertainty narrows attention to, and prompts the following of, specific models, with recentness of model behavior an important moderator.

The concept of adaptive aspirations, as discussed in Cyert and March's Behavioral Theory of the Firm, has long been a topic of interest in both fields. Moreover, many studies in strategy have focused on risk and/or extreme performance. In the current paper, we build on earlier models of adaptive aspirations. We introduce into the models a new risk preference function that incorporates changes in risk preference at extremes of performance. Based on empirical studies and the managerial literature, we also introduce alternative strategies for setting reference groups. Simulations of the resulting models suggest important differences in outcomes from earlier studies and this invites further empirical investigation. These simulations also have significant implications for managerial goal setting.

Using Teece's (2007) influential framework to organize and illustrate our arguments, we demonstrate how the fundamental capabilities of sensing, seizing, and transforming each require firms to harness the cognitive and emotional capacities of individuals and groups to blend effortful forms of analysis with the skilled utilization of less deliberative, intuitive processes.

Using a novel method to measure explicit learning, we track the learned content of six technology-based ventures from three diverse countries as they internationalize. The emergent theoretical framework indicates that firms learn heuristics. These heuristics have a common structure centered on opportunity capture and are learned in a specific developmental order. This results in a deliberately small, yet increasingly strategic, portfolio of heuristics. Broadly, we contribute to the psychological foundations of strategy by highlighting the rationality of heuristics as strategy, capability creation as the cognitive transition from novice to expert heuristics, and simplification cycling as a critical dynamic capability for sustaining competitive advantage.

In this paper, we argue that cross-subsidization reflects a more general tendency toward even allocation over all divisions in multibusiness firms that is driven, at least in part, by the cognitive tendency to na\u00efvely diversify when making investment decisions (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001). We observe that this tendency also leads to partition dependence in which capital allocations vary systematically with the divisions and subdivisions into which the firm is organized or over which capital is allocated. Our first study uses archival data to show that firms' internal capital allocations are biased toward equality over the number of business units into which the firm is partitioned. Two further experimental studies of experienced managers examine whether this bias persists when participants are asked to allocate capital to various divisions of a hypothetical firm. This methodology eliminates the possibility of agency conflicts. Nevertheless, allocations varied systematically with the divisional and subdivisional structure of the firm and with a centralized or decentralized capital allocation manner.

Individuals act on these preferences by behaving reciprocally: rewarding others perceived as behaving fairly and punishing others perceived as behaving unfairly. Successful firms must learn to navigate environments characterized by the reciprocity of their transaction partners. This paper investigates firms' judgments about employee reciprocity and posits a dysfunctional learning process whereby firms that overestimate employee reciprocity learn to correct their beliefs through feedback, while those that underestimate employee reciprocity do not. The result, demonstrated through computer simulation, is a systematic bias toward an overemphasis on employee self-interest, and a resulting inefficiency in wage choices that hurts firm profitability.

This prior work has made great progress in developing our understanding of the retaliation choices most firms will make to a given type of attack. What the information processing perspective has not been able to do is explain firm-specific behavior to predict which competitive moves individual firms will challenge, or explain why individual firms differ in the types of actions that they are most likely to challenge. The goal of this paper is to sharpen the theoretical and empirical focus on predicting firm-level retaliation proclivities. We leverage managerial cognition research to examine the relationship between firm-level differences in the cognitive frameworks that executives possess, and firm-level differences in whether and how quickly firms challenge a market move. Results from a longitudinal study of the airline industry suggest that the addition of a cognitive perspective provides important insights into competitive retaliation.

More importantly, we find that compensating outside directors with stock options has significantly stronger effects than CEO stock options. Finally, contrary to what one would expect, we find that these effects are mutually substituting; that is, if both the outside directors and the CEO are provided with stock option compensation, outside directors' incentives weaken the effect of the CEO's incentives on firms' risk taking.

We find broad support for the proposition that these features are associated with the contractual challenges of allying with licensees when they contribute valuable complementary capabilities toward the commercialization of licensed technologies. Evidence from our data suggests that exclusivity is used as a contractual hostage to safeguard licensee investments in complementary assets and to enable contracting over early stage technologies. Scope restrictions are employed to balance the tradeoffs between the value creation made possible by licensee complementary capabilities and the transactional hazards entailed in working exclusively with licensees. Our results also suggest that scope restrictions and other formal safeguards may be substitute mechanisms for managing similar transactional concerns in licensing alliances.

Whereas partner substitutability reduces the probability of alliance survival, repeated partnership increases the probability. Moreover, mutual trade dependence reduces the negative effect of partner substitutability on alliance survival.

We further argue that the relationship between an MNE's home country environment and the pressure it faces in the host country is moderated by its localization strategy. Results suggest a positive relationship between the host country corruption environment and the pressure subsidiaries face to engage in bribery locally. Mixed results emerged concerning MNEs from home countries participating in the OECD Convention for Combating Bribery. Results concerning the impact of the home country corruption environment are best viewed in light of significant moderating effects. When MNEs did not have local partners, firms from less corrupt home countries reported less pressure to engage in corrupt practices locally; however, the presence of local partners eliminated this relationship. Results will help managers understand the pressures their firm is likely to face when operating in corrupt host country environments, and also offer guidance concerning how the firm might reduce its exposure to those local institutional pressures.

Evidence of gender disparities in executive remuneration","This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

Drawing on over 1,000 years of historical data on the Republic of Rome, and focusing primarily on the period of its establishment (509 BC\u2013338 BC), we identify two generic strategies, capture and governance, that together are essential for organizational resilience. Capture strategy relates to market expansions, while governance strategy refers to the capacity of an organization to assimilate, retain, defend, and increase its dominance within annexed markets. The history of Rome also reveals four supporting tactics\u2014saving power, maintaining a stronghold base, isolating and weakening adversaries, and creating forward outposts\u2014that shore up and reinforce the capture and governance strategies, to create a more enduring and resilient enterprise. Interestingly, a system-wide view of the strategy-tactic framework also offers insights on resilience through smallness, thus illustrating its conceptual utility to organizations of all sizes including small enterprises.

However, the role of capabilities and their proposed contributions have been narrowly theorized and insufficiently tested. We contribute to resolving these issues by considering the conditions under which ordinary and dynamic capabilities contribute to higher relative firm performance. We do so by examining the positive and negative contributions of capabilities to relative firm performance as well as the effects of environmental dynamism and the degree of capability heterogeneity. We utilize measures of relative firm performance at both the process and firm level within a sample of Chilean firms, which due to a dynamic environment allows for a clearer link between the environment and the use of capabilities. We find that environmental dynamism negatively affects the contribution of ordinary capabilities and positively affects the contribution of dynamic capabilities to relative firm performance. Further, heterogeneity strengthens the contribution of dynamic capabilities to relative firm performance, but is less important for ordinary capabilities. Interestingly, we find support for the direct effects of capabilities to be stronger with a process-level performance measure, whereas the influences of environmental dynamism and heterogeneity are stronger with a firm-level measure.

Whether and how divestitures can create value for the divested unit remains unclear. This paper presents an exploratory study based on multiple cases, to examine which factors of the implementation and structuring of a divestiture may increase the performance of a divested unit. The emergent granular framework consists of previously unreported aspects of the divesting process and provides new insights into divestitures and their outcomes. Results indicate that antecedents alone may be insufficient for understanding the outcomes of divestitures. Different combinations of understanding of the rationale for the divestiture and perceived capabilities in the divesting process affect perceptions of divestiture feasibility. Sense of opportunity emerges as the key element of the divesting process for the success of divested units. Factors that participate with sense of opportunity in determining the success of divested units are further considered in the theoretical framework.

We contend that changes in a partner firm's overall resource deployment strategy and partnering strategy influence the value and uniqueness of partnership resources. These changes alter the competitive advantage associated with partnership resources, affecting the propensity of partnership termination. An event history analysis is employed with 150 joint ventures over the period 1990 to 2001 to examine partnership termination within a longitudinal dataset. With initial partnership conditions controlled for, the results indicate significant influences of various changes in partner firm overall resource deployment strategy and partnering strategy on the propensity of termination. Further, competitor imitative activities are found to increase the propensity of termination as they reduce the uniqueness of partnership resources. This study provides support for an evolutionary perspective of resource value and competitive advantage that incorporates strategic change over time.

We propose that knowledge derived from ventures' technology and marketing alliances increases the likelihood that new ventures begin exploiting opportunities in international markets. We also argue that the extent to which the networks open the venture to new knowledge or constrain it to knowledge already shared among the partners will influence the initiation of foreign sales by a venture. Using a longitudinal dataset of 118 ventures in the U.S. biotechnology industry, we confirm that different types of alliances (and, therefore, different types of knowledge\u2014technology and marketing knowledge) differentially impact the likelihood of new venture internationalization. Moreover, network cohesion among venture alliances increases the likelihood that marketing alliances will promote initial foreign market sales, but decreases the likelihood that technology alliances will do so. Our research is a timely response to a call for the study of interactive effects among network structure, complex tasks, and time, and it provides a possible explanation for certain unexpected findings in studies that did not consider the effects of time.

We argue for the need to take into account the role of the resource gap between competitors rather than the absolute resource stock of the focal firm when examining the resource-performance relationship. In particular, we investigate whether the ability of a reputable seller to command a price premium is influenced by the reputation gap (i.e., the reputation differences between the focal seller and its closest competitor standardized by the reputation stock of both sellers). We test our hypotheses on 72 matched pairs of online transactions screened from more than 2,000 auctions of new mobile phones on the Polish Internet auction site Allegro. We find that the ability of a reputable seller to command a price premium (1) increases with the size of the reputation gap between the focal seller and its matched competitor, and (2) becomes increasingly smaller for each additional unit of the seller reputation gap.

Boundaries are determined through governance mode choices, such as whether to make or buy a particular good or activity. While significant work has addressed the performance implications of this fit, less attention has been directed toward strategic execution, or implementation. In particular, the impact of corporate parents has been understudied. We suggest that parent-level implementation capabilities of operating expertise gained through related experience and coordination from collocation combine with governance mode choices to jointly affect performance. By employing theories of organizational economics and testing predictions in casual dining chains, this paper unpacks the relationship between implementation, governance mode choice, and performance. Our findings suggest that parent capabilities may be more important than mode choice fit and that parent benefits are contingent upon mode choice and type of performance.

This study investigates the effect of corporate governance, an important management control mechanism, on the relation between IT investment and firm performance in the Taiwanese electronics industry. Specifically, we explore board independence and foreign ownership, which have increasingly become salient factors concerning corporate governance in emerging markets. We address their roles across firms of different sizes and in industries where degrees of competitiveness run a wide gamut. Our results show a positive moderating effect of board independence on the IT investment-firm performance relation, especially when competition intensifies.

The pursuit of such synergy through diversification is, however, fundamentally driven by the indivisibility of inputs between firms. Following Penrose's insight, I argue that to realize this synergy, a firm needs to actively manage the interdependencies between different business lines, which, in turn, increases its coordination costs. The coordination costs may increase faster than synergy and set a limit to related diversification. This is particularly salient when the firm's existing business lines already have complex interdependencies among them. I test these arguments on a dataset of U.S. equipment manufacturers for the period 1993 to 2003. The results show that a firm is more likely to diversify into a new business when its existing business lines can potentially share more inputs with the new business; however, the firm is less likely to diversify into any new business when its existing business lines are complex. Importantly, the firm's likelihood of diversifying into a new business decreases more with the complexity in the firm's existing business lines if they share more inputs with the new business. These results suggest that increasing coordination costs counterbalance the potential synergistic benefits associated with related diversification.

We link differences in mental models to differences in decision rules and performance in a management simulation. Our results show more accurate mental models lead to better decision rules and higher performance. We also find that decision makers do not need accurate knowledge of the entire business environment; accurate mental models of the key principles are sufficient to achieve superior performance. A fundamental assumption in much of strategic management is that managers who have a richer understanding about organizational capabilities and the dynamics of industry structure can improve the performance of their firms. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting this assumption and show that differences in mental models help explain ex ante why managers and firms adopt different strategies and achieve different levels of competitive success.

While managers can choose from a range of modes to govern alliances, prior empirical evidence offers limited guidance on the performance impact of this choice. We use an agent-based simulation of interfirm decision making to complement empirical studies in this area. Our results point to a complex interplay between interdependencies, governance structures, and firms' search capabilities. Different patterns of interdependence create varying needs with respect to coordination and exploration, while at the same time different governance modes, coupled with organizational search capabilities, supply varying degrees of these factors. Firm performance in an alliance relationship improves when the needs and supplies of coordination and exploration are matched. We find situations in which stronger organizational search capabilities can backfire, leading to lower exploration within the alliance relationship, and hence to lower firm performance. Moreover, we show that for higher levels of interdependence, coordination can become more critical for firm performance than exploration: unless it is tied to coordination, exploration can be ineffective in alliance settings.

In this study, we adopt a psychological perspective of judgment to investigate managers' erratic strategic decisions, which we define as a manager's inconsistent judgments that can shape the direction of the firm. In a study of 2,048 decisions made by 64 CEOs of technology firms, we examine how both metacognitive experience and perceptions of the external environment (hostility and dynamism) could affect the extent to which managers make erratic strategic decisions. The results indicate that managers with greater metacognitive experience make less erratic strategic decisions. The results also indicate that in hostile environments managers make more erratic strategic decisions. But contrary to our expectations, in dynamic environments managers make less erratic strategic decisions. Similarly, hostility and dynamism interact in their effect on erratic strategic decisions in that the positive relationship between environmental hostility and erratic strategic decisions will be less positive for managers experiencing high environmental dynamism than those experiencing low environmental dynamism. These results have important implications for strategic decision-making research.

Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Our evidence also shows that global equity offerings serve as a deliberate strategic tool to increase issuers' international visibility and their propensity to diversify operationally to international markets.

In the context of Business Process Offshoring (BPO), we analyze survey data from 126 offshored processes to understand both the sources of difficulty in integrating distributed work as well as how organizations overcome these difficulties. We find that interdependence between offshored and onshore processes can lower offshored process performance, and investing in coordination mechanisms can ameliorate the performance impact of interdependence. In particular, we outline a distinctive set of coordination mechanisms that rely on tacit coordination\u2014and theoretically articulate and empirically show that tacit coordination mechanisms are distinct from the well-known duo of coordination strategies: building communication channels or modularizing processes to minimize the need for communication.

In this study, we examine how firms' multiplex network ties in business groups represent one important source of capability acquisition. Our focus allows us to go beyond the traditional focus on network structure and offer a novel contingency model that specifies how different types of network ties (e.g., buyer-supplier, equity, and director), individually and in complementary combination, will differentially affect the process of R&D capability acquisition. We also offer an original analysis of how other aspects of network structure (i.e., network density) in business groups affect the efficacy of network ties on R&D capability. Empirically, we provide an original contribution to the capabilities literature by utilizing a stochastic frontier estimation to rigorously measure firm capabilities, and we demonstrate the value of this approach using longitudinal data on business groups in emerging economies. We close by discussing the implications of our supportive results for future research on firm capabilities, organizational networks, and business groups.

In this paper, we operationalize and further develop the construct of managerial discretion at the national level. In an empirical examination of 15 countries, we find that certain informal and formal national institutions\u2014individualism, tolerance of uncertainty, cultural looseness, dispersed firm ownership, a common-law legal origin, and employer flexibility\u2014are associated with the degree of managerial discretion available to CEOs of public firms in a country. In turn, we show that country-level managerial discretion is associated with how much impact CEOs have on the performance of their firms. We also find that discretion mediates the relationship between national institutions and CEO effects on firm performance. Finally, we discuss two inductively derived institutional themes: autonomy orientation and risk orientation.

Based on the literature of socio-psychological and interorganizational relationships, we argue that cohesion among franchisees is negatively associated with opportunistic behaviors that are potentially harmful to the whole chain. We use multilevel and multisource data to show that perceptions of cohesion among franchisees relate both to a) how franchisees apply know-how from franchisors (i.e., deviation from chains standards), and b) whether they transfer or withhold information that could be useful to the franchise system (i.e., information withholding). Our results underscore the importance of relationships among franchisees, an underexplored component of franchising.

Moreover, participants receiving unfavorable information prefer to view lower-credibility, preference-consistent information at a similar rate to higher-credibility, preference-inconsistent information.

We find that short interest is significantly associated in the expected direction with all 11 variables examined. In contrast, analysts tend to positively recommend stocks with high growth, high accruals, and low book-to-market ratios, despite these variables having a negative association with future returns. We then investigate the profitability of using short interest in trading. We find abnormal returns (1.11 percent per month) from a zero-investment strategy that (1) shorts firms with highly favorable analyst recommendations (buy signal) but high short interest (sell signal), and (2) buys firms with highly unfavorable analyst recommendations (sell signal) but low short interest (buy signal).

Our results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity (i.e., the ability to gather, absorb, and strategically leverage new external information) is critical to establishing appropriate technology infrastructure and to assimilating BI systems for organizational benefit. Further, findings show that while top management plays a significant role in effective deployment of BI systems, their impact is indirect and a function of operational managers\u2019 absorptive capacity.

This study examines whether social environment factors explain the pattern of tax shelter adoption. Building on theory related to the diffusion of innovations and institutional isomorphism, I hypothesize direct and indirect ties between prior and potential shelter adopters influence the spread of shelter use. I find that network ties via board interlocks increase the likelihood of adopting the COLI shelter. I also find weak evidence that COLI use spreads geographically.

Using data from 214 firms, we examine the relation between material weakness (MW) disclosures and various IAF attributes and activities. Our results indicate that MW disclosures are negatively associated with the education level of the IAF and the extent to which the IAF incorporates quality assurance techniques into fieldwork, audits activities related to financial reporting, and monitors the remediation of previously identified control problems. The timing of Section 404 work and the nature of follow-up monitoring suggests that these aspects of IAF quality help prevent MWs from occurring. We find that MW disclosures are positively associated with the IAF practice of grading audit engagements and external-internal auditor coordination, suggesting that these activities increase the effectiveness of Section 404 compliance processes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/1/287/3218/The-Role-of-the-Internal-Audit-Function-in-the","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal audit functions and material weaknesses in financial reporting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This study looks for evidence of investor confusion by examining stock returns and trading volume. I find that the initial price reaction to restatement announcements becomes significantly less negative after SOX, even after controlling for the less egregious nature of post-SOX restatements. To assess whether the less negative reaction represents under-reaction, I test whether stock prices drift negatively over the months and years after the initial reaction. I find no evidence of statistically negative drifts unique to the post-SOX period. In fact, I find that post-SOX drifts are statistically less negative than pre-SOX drifts, suggesting that price efficiency actually improves after SOX. Finally, I find no evidence that post-SOX restatements have higher trading volume after controlling for contemporaneous returns, suggesting no increase in disagreement among investors about the restatements. Thus, the findings provide little evidence that investors are confused by post-SOX restatements.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/2/507/3322/Are-Investors-Confused-by-Restatements-after","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

We find that when market participants have a greater difficulty in estimating risk transfer, banks face greater information uncertainty (i.e., larger bid-ask spreads and analyst forecast dispersion). In addition, we find that this effect is mitigated for banks that operate in a higher quality information environment.

We examine issues related to these initiatives using two experiments. CFOs in our experiments exhibit more agreement and are less likely to report aggressively under a less precise (more principles-based) standard than under a more precise (more rules-based) standard. Our results also indicate that CFOs applying a more precise standard are less likely to report aggressively in the presence of a strong audit committee than a weak audit committee. We find no effect of audit committee strength when the standard is less precise. Finally, we find support for a three-path mediating model examining mechanisms driving the effect of standard precision on aggressive reporting decisions.

By their very nature, such segment profitability measures may unwittingly neglect complementarities. Such complementarities have been widely recognized on the demand side due to brand recognition, predatory pricing, or interdependent products. We develop a model showing that important supply-side complementarities can also be prevalent. In particular, when a firm relies on a self-interested supplier for inputs used across multiple segments, the wholesale price it pays depends on the average profitability of its segments. Taking such interaction between upstream pricing and the firm\u2019s downstream reach into account, the model shows that: (1) segment profit calculations can understate or overstate the value added by the segment depending on the segment\u2019s relative contribution margin, and (2) the firm sometimes benefits from devoting resources to less profitable segments and perhaps even from serving seemingly unprofitable markets and/or customers.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/3/805/3348/Supply-Chains-and-Segment-Profitability-How-Input","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['profitability', 'segments', 'supply chains']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of accounting and profitability, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

While the cost/benefit balance of auditor testing of internal controls is highly controversial, prior research has not examined auditor versus client detection of ICD, nor has it examined factors auditors consider in judging ICD severity. We find that auditors detect about three-fourths of unremediated ICD, usually though control testing. This finding contrasts with extant research inferring control deficiency detection effectiveness from publicly available data, underscoring the value of Section 404 auditor testing in improving financial reporting quality. Auditors judge greater severity when a misstatement has already occurred. In the absence of a misstatement, severity is contingent on client and ICD characteristics, implying a more complex and nuanced judgment process without objective evidence of control failure. We also find that clients often underestimate ICD severity, but this tendency is lower among well-controlled companies with a well-designed Section 404 process.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/3/825/3328/Detection-and-Severity-Classifications-of-Sarbanes","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal control deficiencies and auditor testing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ simultaneous equations to estimate both shareholder and managerial responses to the 2003 rate reductions. We find that the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates are substantially stronger than OLS estimates, consistent with our expectation that investor and manager responses are simultaneously determined.

Results reveal that participants taking a holistic systems-based view of a client environment develop more coherently organized mental models that increase their likelihood of identifying management representations that are inconsistent with industry evidence.

We document that these changes are primarily attributable to an increase in the incidence of large special items. We then examine the extent to which this increase in special items is due to either more frequent real economic events related to special item recognition or to the adoption of new accounting standards. Our evidence suggests that changes in the frequency of economic events associated with special items have played a more important and sustained role relative to the role played by adoption of individual accounting standards. Finally, we find that the changing incidence of these economic events is at least in part related to the well-documented increase in competition in the U.S. economy over the last four decades.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/3/945/3340/Changes-over-Time-in-the-Revenue-Expense-Relation","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and economic changes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We specifically focus on the extent that income-increasing (decreasing) discretionary accruals initiated in a prior period reverse to become income-decreasing (increasing) accruals in the current period. The analysis suggests that the extent that such reversals constrain the ability to manage toward earnings objectives depends on both the magnitude of past accrual-based earnings management and the reversal speed of past discretionary accruals. To demonstrate the empirical implications of the analysis, we consider discretionary accrual reversal speed as an additional determinant of the balance sheet constraint on earnings management (Barton and Simko 2002). We show that, conditional on the magnitude of net operating asset overstatement, the probability of achieving quarterly earnings forecasts varies inversely with reversal speed.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/4/1189/3377/Modeling-Discretionary-Accrual-Reversal-and-the","other articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using a laboratory experiment, I find that participants assuming the auditor role in a stylized audit game do not naturally attune to strategic risks, but instead focus resources toward accounts with high non-strategic risk and away from ostensibly low-risk accounts. Manager-participants exploit these allocations by overriding the low-risk accounts more often than accounts with high non-strategic risk. However, auditor-participants who are asked to predict managers' expectations of, and responses to, audit resource allocations, devote additional resources to the low-risk accounts.

Earlier studies show that private firms have lower FRQ, presumably because of lower market demand for public information. Prior research also shows that FRQ is lower in countries with low investor protection, bank-oriented financial systems, and stronger conformity between tax and financial reporting rules. Using firm-level data from the World Bank, our empirical evidence suggests that FRQ positively affects investment efficiency. We further find that the relation between FRQ and investment efficiency is increasing in bank financing and decreasing in incentives to minimize earnings for tax purposes.

There is little prior research on the effect of audit adjustments in nonprofit settings and conflicting research on how auditors react to management's incentives to misreport. We identify potential financial statement areas at risk of manipulation based on incentives specific to public housing authorities. Using pre- and post-audit financial data for almost 3,600 PHAs across seven years, we find that auditors make economically and statistically significant adjustments to PHA financial statements. In addition, we find evidence that audits appear to reduce potential management bias, particularly to reduce risks of overstatement. Overall, audits appear to matter in this nonprofit, low-litigation risk setting where there is a large concentration of non-Big 4 auditors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/4/1289/3319/Monitoring-by-Auditors-The-Case-of-Public-Housing","other articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['nonprofit', 'audits', 'financial statements']","The article discusses audits in the context of nonprofit public housing authorities, indicating a focus on accountability and transparency in a sector that serves marginalized communities.

Trimming causes a downward truncation bias in estimated mean returns that is stronger in ex ante subsamples with more loss firms and in which return distributions are more right-skewed. There is an asymmetric U-shaped relation between return right-skewness and loss frequency across deciles of negative return predictors (Accruals, \u0394NOA, and NOA), and a downward sloping relationship for positive return predictors (CFO and FCF). Consequently, a least-trimmed square (LTS) 1 percent deletion of returns induces a spurious inverted-U-shaped relation between returns and negative predictors, and an exaggerated positive relation for positive predictors. Thus, the resulting trimmed relations do not reject behavioral explanations for these anomalies. Trimming also induces a spurious loss anomaly.

Second, we analyze real earnings management related to pay-for-performance incentives and find that hospitals with stronger performance incentives exhibit a significant incremental decrease in expenditures.

Using data on a large cross-section of occupations, I provide evidence that the level of standardization in financial reporting occupations is far higher than would be expected given their characteristics.

Prior literature assumes managers' use of cost accounting system output is affected by the information coming from the system, but not by the design of the cost system itself. This study examines how the classification of costs into cost pools affects the accuracy of individuals' understanding of relations among costs. I hypothesize that individuals will estimate relations between costs in the same cost pool first and thus more accurately than relations across different pools, because cost pools provide strong cues that meaningful relations are likely to exist within, but not across, pools. I also hypothesize that cost location (within- versus across-pool) has a greater effect on individuals' judgment accuracy when relations among costs are negative than when they are positive. Experimental results are generally consistent with these hypotheses. This experiment shows that cost pool classification choices not only affect the information managers receive, but also their interpretation and use of that information.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/5/1709/3349/Cost-Pool-Classification-and-Judgment-Performance","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cost accounting and managerial decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Thus, even though corporate giving to charity decreases the amount that can be shared between employees and employers, employees behave as if more charitable employers will return proportionally more to employees. It is not until relatively high levels of corporate giving that employee contributions to employers eventually decrease.

We do this by estimating structural models of the two instruments that account for the constraints on their use as well as their effects on each other. Our results suggest that managers use earnings management and expectation management complementarily when managers' ability to use earnings management is less restricted. However, as the constraints on earnings management increase, managers substitute earnings management with expectation management. Moreover, we find that the extent of expectation management influences the extent of earnings management, but not vice versa. Examining the market consequences of the use of these instruments, we find that, while there are penalties for using both earnings management and expectation management, either as complements or as substitutes, the net stock price benefit from meeting or beating earnings targets exceeds these penalties.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/6/1935/3389/An-Analysis-of-Managerial-Use-and-Market","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and expectation management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The proxy identifies differential behavior in the persistence and convergence patterns of profitability. For example, return on net operating assets (RNOA) does not mean-revert (spread of 7 percent after five years between mature and decline firms) when examined by life cycle stage, which has implications for growth rates and forecast horizons. Further, determinants of future profitability such as asset turnover and profit margin are differentially successful in generating increases in profitability conditional on life cycle stage. Finally, investors do not fully incorporate the information contained in cash flow patterns and, as a result, undervalue mature firms.

(2) Share overpricing predicts goodwill write-offs and their magnitude. (3) Acquisitions by overpriced companies\u2014a strategy often recommended by investment bankers and some academics\u2014are often ill-advised (overpaid for and/or strategic misfit), exacerbating the post-acquisition negative returns of buyers beyond the reversal of the overpricing.

This study empirically compares OCI and SI gains and losses using a model that jointly estimates value relevance, predictive value, and persistence. Results show that both SI and OCI gains and losses are value-relevant, but SI gains and losses exhibit zero persistence (i.e., are transitory), while OCI gains and losses exhibit negative persistence (i.e., partially reverse over time). Further, we find that SI gains and losses have strong predictive value for forecasting both future net income and future cash flows, while OCI gains and losses have weaker predictive value.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/6/2047/3311/Comparing-the-Value-Relevance-Predictive-Value-and","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and financial reporting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Over half of all companies that have an IAF specifically hire internal auditors with the purpose of rotating them into management positions (or cycle current employees into the IAF for a short stint before promoting them into management positions). Using archival data, we find that external auditors charge higher fees to companies that use the IAF as a MTG. Using an experiment, we provide evidence as to why fees are higher. Specifically, we find that external auditors perceive internal auditors employed in an IAF used as a MTG to be less objective but not less competent than internal auditors employed in an IAF not used as a MTG. These results have important implications for the many companies that use their IAF as a MTG.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/6/2131/3298/The-Effect-of-Using-the-Internal-Audit-Function-as","main articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['management training', 'internal audit', 'external auditors']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing and management training without significant emphasis on socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques.

Using both general-purpose and context-specific text dictionaries to quantify tone, we find that plaintiffs target more optimistic statements in their lawsuits and that sued firms' earnings announcements are unusually optimistic relative to other firms experiencing similar economic circumstances. These findings are consistent with optimistic language increasing litigation risk. In addition, we find incrementally greater litigation risk when managers are both unusually optimistic and engage in abnormal selling. This finding suggests that firms can mitigate litigation risk by ensuring that optimistic statements are not contradicted by insider selling. Finally, we find that insider selling is associated with litigation risk only when contemporaneous disclosures are unusually optimistic.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/86/6/2155/3287/Disclosure-Tone-and-Shareholder-Litigation","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the relationship between disclosure tone and shareholder litigation, primarily addressing financial metrics and legal implications without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.
