Exploring Pathways to Compliance under Institutional Complexity","In this study, we examined responses to institutional complexity by analyzing when and how organizations respond to a coercive institutional demand from a powerful constituent when other important constituents do not accept the demand as legitimate. We experimentally manipulated institutional complexity and gauged the time to compliance of 100 childcare managers in the Netherlands, and then asked them to describe and explain their anticipated responses to multiple pressures. We found that institutional complexity leads decision makers to delay compliance, but usually not passively: decision makers used the time before compliance to attempt to reduce institutional complexity by neutralizing opposing pressures, challenging the coercive pressure, adapting the practice to suit opponents and their own personal beliefs, and/or waiting to see how the situation would unfold as multiple parties influenced one another. We found two factors influenced decision makers' choice of responses: (1) their interpretation of institutional complexity and (2) their personal beliefs toward the practice itself. Our findings contribute to an emerging understanding of how decision makers interpret and respond to institutional complexity, and thus complement recent studies in the institutional complexity literature.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2011.0276","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['compliance', 'institutional complexity', 'decision makers']","The article discusses institutional complexity and decision-making processes, which touch on ethical considerations in organizational responses.

However, evidence supporting the relation of ostracism and self-esteem level to behavioral outcomes has been mixed. We argue that such mixed effects arise because individuals may engage in behaviors alternately to verify their self-perceptions (suggesting a relation between self-esteem level and behavioral outcomes) or to self-enhance (suggesting no relation between self-esteem level and behavioral outcomes). Within this framing, the question becomes: When do we self-verify and when do we self-enhance? To that end, we position contingent self-esteem\u2014or the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on outcomes in a particular domain\u2014as a determining factor in whether we self-verify or self-enhance, and present a moderated mediation model to account for varying relations between ostracism and job performance.

Studying a context in which work was highly interdependent and helping was pervasive, however, we propose that this emphasis on the initial point of consent is incomplete. Instead, we find that workplace help-seeking and help-giving can be intertwined behaviors enacted through an organizational routine. Our research, therefore, shifts the theoretical emphasis from one of exchange and cost to one of joint engagement. More specifically, we move beyond the initial point of consent to recast help-seeking and help-giving as an interdependent process in which both the help-seeker and the help-giver use cognitive and emotional moves to engage others and thereby propel a helping routine forward. In contrast to the existing literature, an organizational routines perspective also reveals that helping need not be limited to dyads, and that the helping routine is shaped by the work context in which help is sought. Finally, we extend these insights to the literatures on routines and coordination and debate how our results might generalize even if helping is not part of an organizational routine.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.0552","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['help-seeking', 'help-giving', 'engagement', 'interdependence']","The article discusses help-seeking and help-giving as interdependent processes within organizational routines, emphasizing collaboration and emotional engagement.

We examined 11 years (21 seasons) of fashion collections of the world's top fashion houses and found that the foreign professional experiences of creative directors predicted the creativity ratings of their collections. The results revealed individual curvilinear effects for all three dimensions: moderate levels of breadth and cultural distance were associated with the highest levels of creative innovations, whereas depth showed a decreasing positive effect that never turned negative. A significant three-way interaction shows that depth is the most critical dimension for achieving creative innovations, with breadth and cultural distance important at low but not high levels of depth. Our results show how and why leaders' foreign professional experiences can be a critical catalyst for creativity and innovation in their organizations.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.0575","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['foreign experiences', 'cultural distance', 'creative innovations']","The article discusses the impact of foreign professional experiences on creativity and innovation, touching on themes of cultural distance and diversity in leadership.

We then measure these in a product innovation context to test for the performance effect of real options logic vis-\u00e0-vis its alternatives. Sequencing, which distinguishes dynamic allocation regimes more generally, is associated with higher new product sales. Low initial commitment and reallocation do not show individual direct effects on new product sales. However, when assessed as a match, we find that the fit between low initial commitment and reallocation (yes\u2013yes; no\u2013no) increases performance significantly. After controlling for such fit as well as sequencing, we find no significant performance difference between real options logic and other regimes. Our findings imply that insufficient identification of real options logic picks up confounding effects, which may provide an explanation for the inconclusive results in prior studies of real options and performance. In addition to bounding the concept more precisely, we contribute to theory by situating real options logic within the broader set of allocation regimes conducive to innovation performance in uncertain, competitive markets.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.0703","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and performance in product innovation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To understand this heterogeneity, we conceptualize such contamination as a generalization\u2013instantiation process: investors generalize the culpability to the industry category and perceive the instantiation of generalized culpability within the industry bystander firms. This theoretical separation allows us to hypothesize the factors that affect the degree to which both of these elements of the contamination process occurs. Specifically, we predict that characteristics of the misconduct firm or event\u2014factors that lend to investors' familiarity with the misconduct firms, or that prompt attributions of blame for the misconduct\u2014affect the potency of the generalization of culpability to the industry, while characteristics of the industry bystander firms\u2014investors' familiarity with such firms, or factors that lend to investors' perceptions that they have strong governance\u2014affect the firms' vulnerability to being perceived as instantiating the generalized culpability.

This prevalent use of objects likely reveals much about intrapersonal and interpersonal processes at work. By analyzing employee interviews and workspace inventories and observations, we discover that the objects with which employees personalize their workspaces (and even the absence of such objects) symbolize who they are and who they want to be. Through their symbolic representations of self, they find common ground (often through shared nonwork experiences), establish a common understanding of employees' work roles, and share personalistic information about the self\u2014all of which contribute to relationship development among employees and their coworkers, customers, and clients. With symbolic representations of self that offer an optimal amount of stimulation, they focus their attention on their goals and values and establish a desired boundary or integration between work and nonwork\u2014both of which contribute to employees' self-regulation.

Specifically, we evaluate three distinct organizational practices as resources\u2014motivating work design, human resource management practices, and CEO transformational leadership\u2014that can facilitate perceptions that members of the organization are as a whole physically, cognitively, and emotionally invested at work. Our theory is grounded in the notion that, when used jointly, these organizational resources maximize each of the three underlying psychological conditions necessary for full engagement; namely, psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability. The resource management model also underscores the value of top management team members implementing and monitoring progress on the firm's strategy as a means to enhance the effects of organizational resources on collective organizational engagement. We empirically test this theory in a sample of 83 firms, and provide evidence that collective organizational engagement mediates the relationship between the three organizational resources and firm performance. Furthermore, we find that strategic implementation positively moderates the relationship between the three organizational resources and collective organizational engagement.

In Study 1 (n = 35), we utilized qualitative methods to identify the motives and strategies used by pregnant women to manage their professional images.

We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern.

Confirmatory factor analyses support a multidimensional measure of paradoxical leader behavior with five dimensions: (1) combining self-centeredness with other-centeredness; (2) maintaining both distance and closeness; (3) treating subordinates uniformly, while allowing individualization; (4) enforcing work requirements, while allowing flexibility; and (5) maintaining decision control, while allowing autonomy. In Study 2, we examine the antecedents and consequences of paradoxical leader behavior in people management with a field sample of 76 supervisors and 516 subordinates from 6 firms.

However, from a sensemaking perspective, newcomers may also draw insight from stakeholder behavior in order to better understand how to best meet job-related objectives and expectations. These understandings may manifest as performance-related motives, leading to the adoption of risky behaviors that can be detrimental to newcomer health and organizational effectiveness. Using multisource, multilevel, and longitudinal data, we demonstrate that the alcohol use norms of both organizational veterans and clients are significantly associated with the performance drinking motives of newcomers in sales and client service teams, suggesting that veteran and client norms signal to newcomers that drinking alcohol is an effective and legitimate means to improve job performance. In addition, we demonstrate that performance drinking motives mediate the positive relationship between veteran and client alcohol use norms and newcomers' frequency of work-based heavy drinking.

Soliciting suggestions is a form of distant search, since it allows organizations to tap into knowledge that may not reside within their organizational boundaries. Organizations engaging in distant search often face a large pool of suggestions, an outcome we refer to as crowding. When crowding occurs, organizations, given a limited attention span, can attend to only a subset of suggestions. Our core argument is that crowding narrows the attention of organizations; that is, despite organizations\u2019 efforts to reach out to external contributors and access suggestions that capture distant knowledge, they are more likely to pay attention to suggestions that are familiar, not distant. We test our theory with a unique longitudinal dataset that captures how 922 organizations responded to 105,127 crowdsourced suggestions from external contributors. After distinguishing between three different dimensions of distance (content, structural, and personal), we find that (a) all three types of distance have independent negative effects on the likelihood of attention, (b) crowding amplifies these negative effects, and (c) there are differences among the effects\u2019 magnitudes.

First, we shift focus away from structural and relatively static organizational responses to institutional complexity and identify three balancing mechanisms\u2014segmenting, bridging, and demarcating\u2014that allow individuals to manage competing logics and their shifting salience within their everyday work. Second, we integrate these mechanisms in a theoretical model that explains how individuals can continually keep coexisting logics, and their tendencies to either blend or disconnect, in a state of dynamic tension that renders them conflicting-yet-complementary logics. Our model shows how actors are able to dynamically balance coexisting logics, maintaining the distinction between them while also exploiting the benefits of their interdependence. Third, in contrast to most studies of newly formed hybrids and/or novel complexity, our focus on a long-standing context of institutional complexity shows how institutional complexity can itself become institutionalized and routinely enacted within everyday practice.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.0638","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional complexity', 'balancing mechanisms', 'coexisting logics']","The article discusses institutional complexity and balancing mechanisms, which touch on organizational practices but do not strongly emphasize social justice or equity themes.

We describe the organizational productivity and security problems that result from individual attention being engaged in nonwork activities while at work, and find that the organization manages these problems by monitoring employees (tracking attention), contextualizing technology use to remind people of appropriate organizational use practices (cultivating attention), and diverting, limiting, and withholding technology access (restricting attention).

Despite near universal agreement on the role of sanctions for maintaining norms of cooperation, scholars hotly dispute whether individuals sanction based on a rational calculus or because of strong retributive instincts. In this paper we report on a mixed-method field study examining sanctioning behavior. Our goal is to extend theories of sanctioning by evaluating the conditions under which individuals are more likely to administer a sanction in response to a norm violation. To guide the development of our hypotheses, we engage in a qualitative examination of sanctioning decisions in the context of gourmet cuisine. We then test our predictions in a field experiment involving more than 500 gourmet chefs in Italy. Our results suggest that individuals follow retributive instincts, but they also engage in cost\u2013benefit calculations. Indeed, we find that the two logics of sanctioning jointly influence participation in social exchange.

We studied the effects of frame-of-reference training on multiteam system coordination and performance in 249 multiteam systems comprised of specialized teams. Supporting our expectations, we found that: (a) frame-of-reference training had a positive effect on multiteam system performance by enhancing between-team coordination; (b) within-team coordination improved the relationship between frame-of-reference training and between-team coordination, ultimately improving multiteam system performance; and (c) the patterns by which within-team coordination leveraged our intervention depended on teams\u2019 specific functions.

Building on adaptive resonance theory (Grossberg, 1999), a variant of implicit leadership theory, we further hypothesize that leaders\u2019 information-sharing behavior will moderate this curvilinear relationship.

Decision makers perceive candidates that have a greater ability required for the task as less (more) instrumental to their personal outcomes if they expect to compete (cooperate) with the candidate, and they discriminate in favor of candidates that are perceived as more instrumental to them. We tested our theory in the context of racial (Studies 1\u20133) and age (Study 4) discrimination in selection decisions with all-male samples and found evidence consistent with our predictions.

Building on prior work in competitive dynamics from the Austrian School perspective, we propose that imitation can be an effective means of staying ahead, even in the absence of mimetic social pressures. This is because the leader\u2019s imitation of follower actions represents equilibrating moves to maintain the status quo in reaction to the disequilibrating actions that the follower undertakes to catch up with the leader. Furthermore, reduction of difference in competitive positioning between leader and follower serves the same purpose, and both imitation strategies are complementary. These effects of \u201caction imitation\u201d and \u201cpositioning imitation,\u201d we argue, are moderated by the degree of environmental uncertainty, by the extent of the leader\u2019s initial advantage, and by the difference between leader and follower capabilities.

The current study investigates the effects of electronic communication received during nonwork time using an experience sampling methodology to examine within-person relationships among elements of electronic communication (affective tone, time required), emotional responses (anger, happiness), and work-to-nonwork conflict in a sample of 341 working adults surveyed over a seven-day period. Hierarchical linear modeling results suggested that both affective tone and time required were associated with anger, but only affective tone was associated with happiness.

One concept\u2014situation strength\u2014was hypothesized to predict the validities of all of the \u201cBig Five\u201d traits, while the effects of the other\u2014trait activation\u2014were hypothesized to be specific to each trait. Based on this interactionist model, personality\u2013performance correlations were located in the literature, and occupationally homogeneous jobs were coded according to their theoretically relevant contextual properties. Results revealed that all five traits were more predictive of performance for jobs in which the process by which the work was done represented weak situations (e.g., work was unstructured, employee had discretion to make decisions). Many of the traits also predicted performance in job contexts that activated specific traits (e.g., extraversion better predicted performance in jobs requiring social skills, agreeableness was less positively related to performance in competitive contexts, openness was more strongly related to performance in jobs with strong innovation/creativity requirements). Overall, the study\u2019s findings supported our interactionist model in which the situation exerts both general and specific effects on the degree to which personality predicts job performance.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2010.0837","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['job performance', 'personality traits', 'situation strength']","The article focuses primarily on the interaction between personality traits and job performance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In studying these processes, we develop the construct of \u201cidentity elasticity\u201d\u2014the tensions that simultaneously stretch, while holding together, social constructions of identity. To explicate the parameters of elasticity, we problematize previous conceptions of the three foundations of organizational identity\u2014centrality, endurance, and distinctiveness\u2014and document the dialectic tensions experienced in their social constructions. We show how identity is experienced not only through a listing of attributes but also by negotiating a set of processual tensions.

We show how experiencing and navigating the tensions of elasticity is a type of organizational identity work (process) that changes organizational members\u2019 constructions of identity (characteristic).

We argue that the safeguards to limit opportunistic behavior by directly linked firms in a dyad, which have been the focus of extant research, are insufficient to overcome extra-dyadic leakage risks. Instead, firms terminate or avoid ties that expose their knowledge to indirectly linked rivals (\u201cpruning\u201d and \u201cgrafting\u201d) and embed themselves in dense networks (\u201cclosing\u201d) to prevent strategic knowledge spillover. Through a longitudinal study of German board interlocks during 1990\u20132003, we find that firms are more likely to prune, graft, and close their networks as they accumulate strategic knowledge and as the firms to which they are interlocked increasingly generate indirect ties to competitors, even when controlling for dyadic safeguards discussed by prior research. We capture strategic knowledge by tracking firms\u2019 experience in the former Warsaw Pact countries from immediately after the sudden fall of communism in 1990 until 2003.

Effect of Attributional Ambiguity","One stream of leadership theory suggests that leaders are evaluated via inferential observer processes that compare the fit of the target to a prototype of an ideal (charismatic) leader. Alternatively, attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader\u2019s skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes simultaneously explain top-level leader evaluation, and, ultimately, leader retention and selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), observers will mostly rely on inferential processes. In Study 1, we tested our theory in an unconventional context\u2014U.S. presidential elections\u2014and found that the two processes, due to the leader\u2019s charisma and country\u2019s economic performance, interact in predicting whether a leader is selected.

Recent theorizing in strategic management research suggests that there may be important firm-level outcomes influenced by the regulatory focus of top executives. We expand research on regulatory focus theory by testing whether chief executive officers\u2019 (CEOs\u2019) regulatory focus impacts the proclivity of firms to undertake acquisitions. Furthermore, regulatory focus theory suggests that the effects of people\u2019s promotion and prevention foci are magnified when their regulatory focus is congruent with salient situational characteristics, a phenomenon known as regulatory fit. As a test of this idea, we demonstrate how the effects of CEO promotion and prevention foci are differentially impacted by one such characteristic, namely incentive compensation.

We introduce two contingencies to explain when incumbents\u2019 research investments in radical technologies translate into product development and when these upstream investments may get voided by organizational inertia downstream. First, radical technologies can differ in how they conform to incumbents\u2019 existing business models, impacting the extent to which the movement of research outputs toward development will be subject to inertial pressures. Second, incumbents can invest in a radical technology through a variety of modes (internal research, external research contracts, alliances, acquisitions). These modes represent unique combinations of who does research and who is involved in the decision for subsequent development, and, hence, differ in the extent to which they are shielded from inertial pressures. This difference helps explain why incumbents, despite responding to radical technologies, may still be unable to adapt, as well as what types of investments will be more effective in helping firms navigate technological change.

Building on arguments from Gender Role Theory, we find that all else equal, men over-emerge as leaders. However, Expectancy Violation Theory suggests that women are likely to benefit from a countervailing bias.

Results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs), using fixed effects and system general method of moments (GMM) models to correct for endogeneity issues, show that inherited parent firm knowledge is not equally valuable in all countries. The transfer of technological knowledge is value-creating when home country innovation dominates and when parent firm knowledge is transferred to foreign operations in lagging technology countries (when foreign technology dominates). Further, combining managerial knowledge transfers with local subsidiary investments in innovation is shown to boost the performance of foreign operations located in leading technology countries, suggesting that the prior experiences, connections, and knowledge of expatriate managers, can be particularly useful in managing new knowledge generated in these countries. Overall, this paper extends our understanding of knowledge management within MNCs by exploring when transfers of parent technological and managerial knowledge are more likely to improve the performance of foreign operations in increasingly globally competitive industries.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0724","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge', 'performance', 'foreign operations']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of knowledge transfer and performance in multinational corporations without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we contribute to research on social exchange theory by isolating the trust outcomes of interorganizational exchanges from other outcomes emphasized by learning and knowledge-based perspectives, and by specifying important boundary conditions for the emergence of trust in interorganizational exchanges. We make such a theoretical contribution within the domain of strategic alliances by investigating the effects of previous alliance agreements, or prior ties, between the partnering firms. We find that prior ties generally lead to learning about a partner\u2019s anticipated behavioral patterns, which helps a firm predict when self-interested behavior may occur and know how to interact with the partner during the coordination and execution of the alliance tasks. By contrast, the kind of trust emphasized in social exchange theory is not generally rooted in prior ties and only emerges from prior relationships under certain conditions.

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed. Unlike prior research in this vein, we account for the fact that reputational penalties associated with such practices may differ across audiences because of differences in interpretations of the practice and differences in causal attributions about its use. Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties to managers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted. The findings suggest that reputational penalties for questionable behaviors may be more contingent and harder to sustain than previously thought.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.1091","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['governance', 'reputation', 'self-interest', 'controversial practices']","The article discusses reputational penalties related to governance practices, hinting at ethical considerations in managerial behavior.

Although current research has explained the phenomenon using several different theoretical perspectives, prior studies have not explicitly tested the theorized mechanisms. This paper develops and tests a model that incorporates three theories of trickle-down effects for interactional justice perceptions: social exchange theory, social learning theory, and displaced aggression. Using cross-sectional data from 200 supervisor\u2013subordinate dyads in Study 1 and longitudinal data from 270 supervisor\u2013subordinate dyads in Study 2, we test this multiple mediator model. The results demonstrate that the two aspects of interactional justice perceptions\u2014interpersonal and informational justice perceptions\u2014trickle down from supervisors to subordinates through two different mechanisms. Specifically, displaced aggression accounts for the trickle-down effects of interpersonal justice perceptions and social exchange accounts for the trickle-down effects of informational justice perceptions.

Our comparison of one failed and one successful attempt to introduce pay TV in the U.S. reveals how entrepreneurs can first enter a regulated market without facing resistance, and then introduce a new frame to legitimize their product or service despite growing resistance from incumbents. Our framework highlights framing as a strategy and framing contests as a mechanism through which entrepreneurs and incumbents can battle to enable or disable institutional change. As part of this process, we also uncover how entrepreneurs evolve from self-serving actors with no field-level intentions to powerful groups that create a ripple effect in their environment by moving their target of influence from private to institutional actors.

One research stream, the \u201cinertial view,\u201d argues that the pervasiveness of interdependencies among activities increases inertia, which inhibits strategic renewal. Another research stream, the \u201cadaptive view,\u201d argues that the pervasiveness of interdependencies among activities allows for a rich flow of resources and information, which enables strategic renewal. In this article we argue that both views provide important insights but arrive at conflicting conclusions because they focus on different dimensions of interdependency. To resolve this paradox, we distinguish between an activity system's interdependency patterns and interdependency rules. We propose that the dimensions of the interdependency pattern set the context in which the dimensions of the interdependency rules guide the exchange of resources and information among interdependent activities. Integrating these two components of an activity system's interdependency design leads to a \u201cdual understanding\u201d of interdependency as both pattern and rule and helps explain how the inertial forces of interdependency patterns may be overcome by putting appropriate interdependency rules in place.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2012.0177","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","2","['interdependency', 'strategic renewal', 'adaptation']","The article primarily focuses on organizational interdependencies and strategic renewal without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Importantly, events can originate at any hierarchical level and their effects can remain within that level or travel up or down throughout the organization, changing or creating new behaviors, features, and events.

Yet there is currently no theoretical lens through which to understand the nature of\u2014and psychological contributors to\u2014these employee-stakeholder relationships at the individual level. Drawing on social identity theory, the proposed framework reveals that when an employee identifies strongly with the organization, this affects the way the employee views external stakeholders in the social landscape at work, resulting in some surprising consequences.

Drawing from social identity theory, we develop a theory of lying as a socially motivated behavioral response to identity threats at the personal, relational, or collective levels of identity in organizational life. Specifically, we propose that perceived identity threats undermine the unique fundamental identity motives at each level of self, and that as threat sensitivity and threat intractability increase, individuals become more likely to use lying as a threat management response in their interactions with other organizational members. Further, we propose that identity-based characteristics of organizational members with whom threatened individuals interact (i.e., the audience) determine the likelihood that lying will occur by assuaging or amplifying threats during identity enactment. Thus, by applying an identity lens to examine normatively unethical behavior, we develop a comprehensive model of everyday lying as socially motivated and identity-based behavior with implications for ongoing workplace relationships.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2013.0167","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'social identity theory', 'unethical behavior', 'workplace relationships']","The article explores lying as a socially motivated behavior linked to identity threats, which aligns with themes of social dynamics and ethical considerations in workplace relationships.

I describe how nine elite high-end, cutting-edge culinary groups in the U.S. and Europe, ranging from innovative restaurants to culinary R&D groups, use negotiated joining\u2014a previously undocumented process\u2014to systematically construct and fill these emergent, open-ended roles. I show that negotiated joining is a consistently patterned, iterative process that begins with a role that both aspirant and target group explicitly understand to be provisional. This provisional role is then jointly modified and constructed by the aspirant and target group through repeated iterations of proposition, validation through trial and evaluation, and selective integration of validated role components. The initially provisional role stabilizes and the aspirant achieves membership if enough role components are validated; otherwise the negotiated joining process is abandoned. Negotiated joining allows the aspirant and target group to learn if a mutually desirable role is likely and, if so, to construct such a role. In addition, the provisional roles in negotiated joining can support absorptive capacity by allowing novel role components to enter target groups through aspirants\u2019 efforts to construct stable roles for themselves, while the internal adjustment involved in integrating newly validated role components can have the unintended side effect of supporting adaptation by providing opportunities for the groups to use these novel role components to modify their role structure and goals to suit a changing and uncertain environment.

Our research shows that men and women both experience uncertainty when asked to generate ideas as members of a mixed-sex work group: men because they may fear offending the women in the group and women because they may fear having their ideas devalued or rejected. Most group creativity research begins with the assumption that creativity is unleashed by removing normative constraints, but our results show that the PC norm promotes rather than suppresses the free expression of ideas by reducing the uncertainty experienced by both sexes in mixed-sex work groups and signaling that the group is predictable enough to risk sharing more\u2014and more-novel\u2014ideas.

Additionally, tight cultures are less receptive to foreign creative ideas. But we also found that in certain circumstances\u2014when members of a tight culture do creative work in their own or culturally close countries\u2014cultural tightness can actually promote creativity success.

We theorize that managers make decisions involving risk and decisions involving change under different conditions and motivated by different concerns. Our results show internal social comparison across units within a firm will motivate risk, whereas external social comparison across firms will motivate change. When a fund experiences a performance shortfall relative to internal social comparison, the manager is likely to make decisions that involve risk because the social and spatial proximity of internal comparisons trigger individual concern and fear of negative individual consequences, such as job loss. In contrast, when a fund experiences a performance shortfall in comparison with external benchmarks, the manager is more likely to consider the shortfall an organizational concern and make changes that do not necessarily involve risk. Although we might assume that negative performance in comparison with both internal and external benchmarks would spur risky change, our results indicate that risky change occurs most often when a decision maker receives unfavorable internal social performance feedback and favorable external social performance feedback. By questioning assumptions about why and when organizational change involves risk, this study begins to separate change and risk outcomes of the decision-making process.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839214566297","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['social comparison', 'risk', 'change']","The article primarily focuses on behavioral performance feedback in the mutual fund industry, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Drawing on interorganizational learning theory, we argue and show that disruption-linked adoptions\u2014those that occur following activists\u2019 disruptive protests against the adopting organization\u2014appear to be taken under coercive pressure and therefore provide non-targeted organizations with poor inferences about the merits of the practice.

Gay men are more likely to be in female-majority occupations than are heterosexual men, and lesbians are more represented in male-majority occupations than are heterosexual women, but even after accounting for this tendency, common to both gay men and lesbians is a propensity to concentrate in occupations that provide task independence or require social perceptiveness, or both.

Furthermore, our findings show that participating in big hits\u2014blockbuster initial public offerings\u2014has a positive relationship with status when firms are young and a positive relationship with reputation when firms are older, and it helps low-status and low-reputation firms more than it helps high-status and high-reputation firms.

This study examines in rich historical detail the development of accounting in the Jesuit Order, illustrating how Jesuit accounting started from a rationality that did not presuppose an external ordering principle; instead, Jesuit rationality was unfolding\u2014founded in continuous interrogations informed by common, purposeful procedural logics stemming from rhetorical practices used to classify, recall, and invent knowledge. I examine this concept of unfolding rationality in two areas of Jesuit practices: spiritual self-accountability and administrative accounting and recordkeeping. In this Jesuit rationality, the relationships between means and ends, and how and why behaviors take place, were not anchored permanently in a substantive logic. Instead, procedural logics left individual Jesuits and the community to imagine modes of action in the specific social and organizational contexts in which their missions operated. Jesuit rationality was thus unfolding, a persistent and recursive mode of governing social behavior and searching for organizational order that generated large-scale administrative routines and institutional dynamism while never fully achieving that order. The analysis brings into question our understanding of the historical and institutional genealogies of modern rationality and its taken-for-granted link with Protestant ethics.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839215592174","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['accountability', 'rationality', 'social behavior', 'institutional logics']","The article explores themes of accountability and social behavior through the lens of Jesuit practices, suggesting a critique of traditional rationality linked to Protestant ethics.

I argue that in contexts in which institutional arrangements such as paid leave, subsidized childcare, and part-time employment opportunities mitigate work\u2013family conflict, women are less likely to opt for business ownership as a fallback employment strategy. As a result, women in these contexts may be relatively less well represented among entrepreneurs as a whole but more well represented in growth-oriented forms of entrepreneurship. To evaluate this claim, I analyze survey data from 24 countries over the span of eight years. Multilevel analyses show that supportive work\u2013family institutions are associated with larger gender gaps in the odds of early-stage and established business ownership but smaller gender gaps among business owners in terms of their business size, growth aspirations, and propensity to innovate or use new technology. Consistent with my theoretical argument, women business owners are also less likely to report pursuing entrepreneurship because they lacked attractive employment options in contexts in which supportive institutions are in place. Findings suggest that institutional contexts characterized by salient work\u2013family conflict may fuel women\u2019s aggregate representation in business activity but reinforce their segregation into less growth-oriented (and thus lower-status) ventures.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839215591627","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['gender inequality', 'entrepreneurship', 'work-family conflict', 'institutional arrangements', 'women']","The article focuses on gender inequalities in entrepreneurship, emphasizing the impact of institutional arrangements on women's representation in business.

We find that types of funding partners vary significantly from one another: they all provide resources, but their institutional logics differ. Venture capitalists (VCs) pick young firms with significant patented technologies and help firms launch products, and high-status VCs strengthen both the patenting and product innovations of young firms. Corporate venture capitalists and government agencies also select patent-intensive firms but are less effective than VCs in helping ventures during the relationship because, though these partners often have impressive technical and commercial resources for innovation, their institutional logics constrain how effectively young firms can access their resources. Relative to other types of funding partners, VCs have a closer advisor relationship with the venture; greater power, influence, and access to resources; better-paced and more-motivating milestones; and better understanding of the commercialization process.

Using data on new-investor recruitment into Kenya\u2019s nascent capital market, the Nairobi Securities Exchange, from 2005 through 2008, I identified mechanisms driving social segmentation as well as integration of disparate groups. The empirical context is characterized by weak formal institutions and high levels of inter-ethnic distrust, a novel but productive setting for studying how potential adopters use social identities to resolve uncertainty around expected gains of participating in a new market. Results show that instead of exhibiting blanket influence by homophilous peers, potential investors were positively influenced by profits earned by proximate coethnic peers primarily when their own exposure to corrupt financial organizations was higher but were negatively influenced by the profits of ethnic outsiders when the market was identified with distrusted political rivals. Several mechanisms moderated this pattern of distrust, including inter-ethnic residential and religious integration but especially the use of national language rather than ethnic language advertising campaigns, which reframed the market as a shared social identity. Findings indicate that the negative effects of social segmentation, including the distorting influences of dissimilar peers and environmental factors such as political tensions and distrust in institutions, can be reversed when potential investors learn about new market opportunities from neutral third parties or when policy makers frame such practices in socially neutral language.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839215597269","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","7","['diverse', 'social groups', 'inter-ethnic distrust', 'social identity', 'neutral language']","The article explores themes of social identity and inter-ethnic dynamics in market participation, emphasizing the importance of reframing economic opportunities in socially neutral language to overcome distrust.

However, the potential of an HIE platform can only be realized when its multiple constituent users actively participate in using its variety of services. In this research, we model HIE systems as multisided platforms that incorporate self-service technologies whose value to the users depends on both user-specific and network-specific factors. We develop a model of adoption, use, and involvement of clinical practices in the coproduction of the HIE services. This model is grounded in social network theory, service operations theory, and institutional isomorphism theory. A longitudinal study of actual adoption and use behaviors of 2,054 physicians within 430 community medical practices in Western New York over a three-year period has been carried out to evaluate the proposed model. This study has been supported by HEALTHeLINK, the Regional Health Information Organization of Western New York, which has an extensive database comprising over half a million transactions on patient records by the HIE users. We extracted panel data on adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors from this database and carried out a detailed analysis using metrics derived from the foundational theories. Positioning practices within two distinct but interrelated networks of patients and practitioners, we show that adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors are influenced by the topographies of the two networks, isomorphic effects of large practices on the smaller ones, and practice labor inputs in HIE use. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the drivers of HIE adoption and use at the level of medical practices. These results have implications for marketing and revenue management of HIE platforms, as well as public health and national/regional healthcare policy making.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2014.0547","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['healthcare reform', 'service co-production', 'social network theory']","The article discusses healthcare reform and the involvement of various stakeholders in service co-production, indicating some awareness of collaborative practices in healthcare.

Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2014.0553","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['healthcare', 'patient demographics', 'readmission risk']","The article discusses healthcare analytics and patient demographics, which touches on equity in healthcare access but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Using grounded theory methodology, we conducted a multiyear case study of a large IT transformation program in a major commercial bank, during which we encountered the interrelated themes of paradoxes and ambidexterity. Grounded in our case, we construct a substantive theory of ambidexterity in IT transformation programs that identifies and explains the paradoxes that managers need to resolve in IT transformation programs. The ambidexterity areas we identified are (1) IT portfolio decisions (i.e., IT efficiency versus IT innovation), (2) IT platform design (i.e., IT standardization versus IT differentiation), (3) IT architecture change (i.e., IT integration versus IT replacement), (4) IT program planning (i.e., IT program agility versus IT project stability), (5) IT program governance (i.e., IT program control versus IT project autonomy), and (6) IT program delivery (i.e., IT program coordination versus IT project isolation). What weaves these six areas together is the combined need for IT managers to employ ambidextrous resolution strategies to ensure short-term IT contributions and continuous progress of IT projects while simultaneously working toward IT transformation program success as a foundation for IT-enabled business transformation. However, in addition to this commonality, we find that the nature of paradoxical tensions differs across the six areas and requires slightly different management strategies for paradox resolution. Ambidexterity areas (1), (2), and (3) are associated with IT transformation strategizing and, in addition to balancing short- and long-term goals, require the mutual accommodation and blending of business and IT interests in the spirit of IT-business partnering to achieve IT-enabled business change and IT-based competitiveness.

This suggests that imitation of rivals\u2019 decisions can be an efficient means for IT vendors when reconfiguring their service-line offerings. To explore how such imitation unfolds in this sector, we estimate a series of logistic regression models of 116 IT vendors\u2019 service-line choices over three time periods. First, from the strategic imitation literature we identify the key imitation \u201creferents,\u201d which is a group of firms or a single firm with specific traits, and we test the relative influence of each referent. All of our analysis includes these referents as predictors of service-line choice. Next, we tested more nuanced models using theoretically guided subsamples as follows. One, based on information systems (IS) literature, we consider the IT vendors as embedded in three distinct \u201cinstitutional spheres,\u201d each corresponding to a knowledge domain, namely, technical, functional, and vertical industry domains. We separately examine imitation in each subsample corresponding to the three types of service lines. Two, based on strategy literature, we consider that the influence of the imitation referents differs when the choice under consideration is the addition of a new service line versus a withdrawal. Our results across all of these subsamples uncover a nuanced pattern of imitation that sometimes contrasts the full-sample results. The most prominent result is that although imitation is highly salient, the different imitation referents are not universally influential across all knowledge domains and between development versus withdrawal decisions. Specifically, the imitation of similar firms is widespread, whereas the imitation of largest firms or offering popular service-lines, which indicates bandwagon effects, are at play only selectively. This study contributes to the IS literature by laying a basis for a variety of research directions including resource spillovers and vicarious learning in IT sectors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2014.0555","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic imitation in IT service vendors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Competing Risks Analysis of Male and Female IT Professionals\u2019 Job Mobility and Relative Pay Gap","This study draws on distributive justice, human capital, and stigmatization theories to hypothesize relationships between relative pay gap and patterns of job mobility. Our study also expands the  criterion space of job mobility by contrasting different job destinations when information technology (IT) professionals make job moves. We examine three job moves: (a) turnover to another IT job in a different firm, (b) turnaway-within to a non-IT job, and (c) turnaway-between to a different firm and a non-IT job. We analyze work histories spanning 28 years for 359 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We report three major findings. First, as hypothesized, larger relative pay gaps significantly increase the likelihood of job mobility. Second, IT males and IT females have different job mobility patterns. IT males are more likely to turn over than turn away-between when faced with a relative pay gap. Further, and contrary to predictions from human capital theory, IT males are more likely to turn away-within than turn over. This surprising finding suggests that the ubiquitous use of IT in other business functions may have increased the value of IT skills for non-IT jobs and reduced the friction of moving from IT to other non-IT positions. Third, and consistent with stigmatization arguments, IT females are more likely to turn away from IT than to turn over when faced with a relative pay gap. In fact, to reduce relative pay gaps, IT females tend to take on lower-status jobs that pay less than their IT jobs.

We propose new online metrics based on the content, in-links, and out-links of firms' websites to measure the presence of online isomorphism as well as uncover its utility in predicting competitor relationships. Through rigorous analysis involving more than 2,600 firms, we find that predictive models for competitor identification based on online metrics are largely superior to those using offline data such as Standard Industrial Classification codes and market values of firms. In addition, combining online and offline metrics can boost the predictive performance. We also find that such models are valuable for identifying nuances of competitor relationships such as asymmetry and the role of industrial divisions. Furthermore, the suggested predictive models can effectively rank firms in an industrial division by their likelihood of being competitors to a focal firm as well as identify new future competitors, thus adding to a portfolio of evidence indicating their utility for managers and analysts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2014.0563","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive isomorphism and online metrics for competitor identification without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Yet, the recently uncovered deliberation-without-attention (D-W-A) effect suggests that distracting consumers from the decision-making process may improve their decision quality when there are a large number of decision parameters to consider. To ascertain whether the D-W-A effect can be triggered through the use of distracting website features in the context of online shopping, two experiments are conducted. The first experiment reveals that the presence of distracting website features, in the form of pop-ups, gives rise to annoyance in general, but also leads to better purchase decisions when the decision to be made is complex. The second experiment supports the findings of the first and sheds further light on the underlying mode of thought triggered by these features. In particular, by eliminating a number of potential alternative mechanisms, including online judgments, the mere disruption of decision-related thought, and cognitively constrained conscious deliberation, the second experiment demonstrates that unconscious deliberation is likely to be the underlying cause of superior decision making. With these findings, this research supports a more balanced view in the recent human\u2013computer interaction literature, which suggests that the usual advice to minimize the use of distracting website features should be examined more carefully. The research also uncovers evidence that contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding the D-W-A effect and unconscious thought theory.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0566","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of web design and consumer decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine the relationship between NN regulation and Internet fragmentation in a game-theoretic model that considers the interplay between termination fees, exclusivity, and competition between two Internet service providers (ISPs) and between two content providers (CPs). An exclusivity arrangement between an ISP and a CP reduces the CP\u2019s exposure to some end users, but it also reduces competition over ads among the CPs. Fragmentation arises in equilibrium when competition over ads among the CPs is very strong, the CPs\u2019 revenues from advertisements are very low, the content of the CPs is highly complementary, or the termination fees are high. We find that the absence of fragmentation is always beneficial for consumers, because they can enjoy all available content. Policy interventions that prevent fragmentation are thus good for consumers. However, results for total welfare are more mixed. A zero-price rule on traffic termination is neither a sufficient nor a necessary policy instrument to prevent fragmentation.

Its on-demand feature allows users to enjoy full scalability and to handle possible demand fluctuations at no risk. In recent years, SaaS has become an appealing alternative to purchasing, installing, and maintaining modifiable off-the-shelf (MOTS) software packages. We present a game-theoretical model to study the competitive dynamics between the SaaS provider, who charges a variable per-transaction fee, and the traditional MOTS provider. We characterize the equilibrium conditions under which the two coexist in a competitive market and those under which each provider will fail and exit the market. Decreasing the lack-of-fit (or the cross-application data integration) costs of SaaS results in four structural regimes in the market. These are MOTS Dominance \u2192 Segmented Market \u2192 Competitive Market \u2192 SaaS Dominance. Based on our findings, we recommend distinct competitive strategies for each provider. We suggest that the SaaS provider should invest in reducing both its lack-of-fit costs and its per-transaction price so that it can offer increasing economies of scale. The MOTS provider, by contrast, should not resort to a price-cutting strategy; rather, it should enhance software functionality and features to deliver superior value. We further examine this problem from the software life-cycle perspective, with multiple stages over which users can depreciate the fixed costs of installing and customizing their MOTS solutions on site. We then present an analysis that characterizes the competitive outcomes when future technological developments could change the relative levels of the lack-of-fit costs. Specifically, we explain why the SaaS provider will always use a forward-looking pricing strategy: When lack-of-fit costs are expected to decrease (increase) in the future, the SaaS provider should reduce (increase) its current price. This is in contrast with the MOTS provider, who will use the forward-looking pricing strategy only when lack-of-fit costs are expected to increase. Surprisingly, when such costs are expected to decrease, the MOTS provider should ignore this expectation and use the same pricing strategy as in the benchmark with invariant lack-of-fit costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0571","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Software as a Service (SaaS) and competitive market dynamics without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

Contract duration is a strategic decision that aligns interests of clients and vendors, providing the benefits of business continuity to clients and incentives to undertake relationship specific investments for vendors. Considering the salience of this phenomenon, there has been limited empirical scrutiny of how contract duration is awarded. We posit that clients and vendors obtain two benefits from being embedded in an interorganizational network. First, the learning and experience accumulated from being embedded in a client-vendor network could mitigate the challenges in managing longer term contracts. Second, the network serves as a reputation system that can stratify vendors according to their trustworthiness and reliability, which is important in longer term arrangements. In particular, we attempt to make a substantive contribution to the literature by theorizing about embeddedness at four distinct levels: structural embeddedness at the node level, relational embeddedness at the dyad level, contractual embeddedness at the level of a neighborhood of contracts, and finally, positional embeddedness at the level of the entire network. We analyze a data set of 22,039 outsourcing contracts implemented between 1989 and 2008. We find that contract duration is indeed associated with structural and positional embeddedness of participant firms, with the relational embeddedness of the buyer-seller dyad, and with the duration of other contracts to which it is connected through common firms. Given the nature of our data, identification using traditional ordinary least squares based approaches is difficult given the unobserved errors clustered along two nonnested dimensions and the autocorrelation in a firm\u2019s decision (here the contract) with those of contracts in its reference group. We use a multiway cluster robust estimation and a network auto-regressive estimation to address these issues.

Our analysis shows that a monopolistic firm obtains a greater profit from offering a consumer-customizable product than from offering a preconfigured standardized product only if consumers are sufficiently capable to conduct the customization task; otherwise, it is more profitable for the firm to offer a standardized product. Moreover, consumers obtain a greater surplus when the firm offers the customizable product. We also consider the case where the firm is capable of offering both a customizable product and a standardized product and find that the firm benefits more from offering both products than offering either product if consumer customizing capability and the customization cost are not too high. Interestingly, when the firm offers both products, its effort in enhancing consumer customizability (e.g., offering free consumer training) always benefits both the firm and consumers, but its effort in increasing the value of the standardized product (e.g., offering more functions) can hurt both the firm profit and consumer surplus.

We propose a new design that uses consumer-location data from mobile devices (smartphones, smart pads, laptops, etc.) to build a \u201cgeosimilarity network\u201d among users. The geosimilarity network (GSN) could be used for a variety of analytics-driven applications, such as targeting advertisements to the same user on different devices or to users with similar tastes, and to improve online interactions by selecting users with similar tastes. The basic idea is that two devices are similar, and thereby connected in the GSN, when they share at least one visited location. They are more similar as they visit more shared locations and as the locations they share are visited by fewer people. This paper first introduces the main ideas and ties them to theory and related work. It next introduces a specific design for selecting entities with similar location distributions, the results of which are shown using real mobile location data across seven ad exchanges. We focus on two high-level questions: (1) Does geosimilarity allow us to find different entities corresponding to the same individual, for example, as seen through different bidding systems? And (2) do entities linked by similarities in local mobile behavior show similar interests, as measured by visits to particular publishers? The results show positive results for both. Specifically, for (1), even with the data sample\u2019s limited observability, 70%\u201380% of the time the same individual is connected to herself in the GSN.

The results demonstrated the discriminating alignment between information system (IS) use-related activity and support structures in enhancing system users\u2019 work performance in the SRP. Specifically, suitability of impersonal support moderated the effects of standardized system use and individual adaption on performance, whereas availability of personal support only moderated the effect of nonstandardized system use on performance. For moderating role of personal support, IS specialists support had a lower influence than peer-champion support and peer-user support. This study contributes to the extant literature by (1) conceptualizing the turbulent SRP, (2) applying sensemaking theory to the initial postadoptive stage, (3) adding to the theoretical debate on the value of system use, and (4) unveiling the distinct roles of support structures under different types of use activities. Practical suggestions are provided for organizational management and policy makers to deal with the complexities in the SRP.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0578","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['support structures', 'performance', 'sensemaking theory']","The article discusses the importance of support structures in enhancing user performance, which touches on organizational management but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Studies in the information systems literature and most economics training examining the substitution of IT capital for other inputs use the Allen elasticity of substitution (AES). We present a less-well-known measure for the elasticity of substitution, the Morishima elasticity of substitution (MES). In contrast to the AES, which is misleading when there are three or more inputs\u2014such as non-IT capital, labor, and IT capital\u2014the MES provides a substitution measure where the scale is meaningful, and the measure differs depending on which price is changing. This is particularly important for IT capital, because prices have been declining, and there is evidence that IT capital can substitute for non-IT capital or labor in a qualitatively different way than non-IT capital and labor substitute for each other. Methodologically, we also show the impact of imposing local regularity\u2014for example, monotonicity of output from increases in inputs\u2014which we do through Bayesian methods employed to estimate the underlying functions that are used to calculate various measures of substitution. We demonstrate the importance of the MES as an underrecognized measure of substitution and the impact of imposing local regularity using an economy-wide industry-level data set covering 1998\u20132009 at the three-digit North American Industry Classification System code level. Our MES results show that reductions in the price of IT capital increase the quantity of IT capital in use, but are unlikely to change the input share of IT capital\u2014the value of IT capital as a proportion of the value of all inputs\u2014in contrast to major studies using the AES. In addition, estimates for both elasticities of substitution are more stable after imposing local regularity. Both of these advances\u2014that is, the MES and imposing local regularity\u2014have the potential to impact future work on IT productivity, IT pricing, IT cost estimation, and any type of analysis that posits the substitution of IT capital for non-IT capital or labor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0570","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information technology substitution and economic measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This research investigates the following two questions: (1) How can different IS threats be characterized and distinguished in terms of their risk characteristics? and (2) how are risk characteristics related to public searches for information on IS threats? Applying psychometric analysis, our analyses of survey data first show that unknown risk and dread risk are two underlying dimensions that can characterize different IS threats. Drawing broadly on the literature of information foraging theory, we examine the influence of risk characteristics on public searches for information on these threats. We utilize a search engine log to extract searches related to IS threats. We develop and estimate a system of equations with correlated individual-specific error terms using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We find that the two risk characteristics exert differential impacts on information search behavior (including types of information sought, number of pages viewed, and length of query).

Recommender systems form a critical component of the business analytics toolkit and, by enabling firms to effectively target customers with products and services, are helping alter the e-commerce landscape. A variety of methods exist for providing recommendations, with collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and association-rule-based methods being the most common. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of recommendations made using association rules. This is accomplished by combining rules when possible and stands apart from existing rule-combination methods in that it is strongly grounded in probability theory. Combining rules requires the identification of the best combination of rules from the many combinations that might exist, and we use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. Because it is impractical to apply the maximum likelihood framework directly in real time, we show that this problem can equivalently be represented as a set partitioning problem by translating it into an information theoretic context\u2014the best solution corresponds to the set of rules that leads to the highest sum of mutual information associated with the rules. Through a variety of experiments that evaluate the quality of recommendations made using the proposed approach, we show that (i) a greedy heuristic used to solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem is very effective, providing results comparable to those from using the optimal set partitioning solution; (ii) the recommendations made by our approach are more accurate than those made by a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization; and (iii) the recommendations can be made in a fraction of a second on a desktop computer, making it practical to use in real-world applications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0583","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of business analytics and recommender systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because online social networking makes it easier for individuals to interact with experientially similar others in regard to health issues and to exchange social support, there has been an increasing effort to understand how networks function.

By studying longitudinal data from 1,322 individuals and their communication ties in an online healthcare social network, we find that firsthand disease experience, which provides knowledge of the disease, increases the probability that patients will find experientially similar others and establish communication ties. Patients\u2019 cognitive abilities, including the information load that they can process and the range of social ties that they can manage, however, limit their network growth. In addition, we find that patients\u2019 efforts to reach out for additional social resources are associated with their embeddedness in the network and the cost of maintaining connections.

As mobile technologies can reach users anywhere and anytime, LMP becomes a promising new channel. We unravel the dynamic sales impact of LMP on the basis of a randomized field experiment with 22,000 mobile users sponsored by one of the largest mobile service providers in the world. Our identification strategy is to gauge the marginal increases in consumer purchases of the geo-fenced treatment group of users who received LMP, above and beyond the baseline control groups. There are two controls: one group who received the same LMP but not in the virtual geo-fencing locational range (nongeo-fenced control), and the other who did not receive the LMP but in the geo-fencing range (geo-fenced control). The latter control serves as an organic holdout baseline from the similar population, i.e., counterfactual test of what if without the mobile LMP intervention, to identify the actual \u201clift\u201d of incremental purchases caused by the treatment with the mobile LMP intervention. Findings suggest that LMP treatment has a significantly stronger impact on contemporaneous (same-day) purchases and delayed (subsequent-days) purchases than the controls. The randomized experiment design renders these findings robust to alternative explanations such as mobile usage behavior heterogeneity, product effects heterogeneity, nonrandomized sample-selection bias, and endogeneity concerns. Follow-up surveys with the field experiment users explore the nuanced mechanisms via which LMP may induce the impulsive, same-day purchases, and create product awareness for the planned subsequent-days purchases. LMP can generate six times more purchases than nongeo-fenced control with the LMP intervention, and 12 times more than geo-fenced control without the LMP intervention. LMP has a delayed sales effect for 12 days after the mobile promotions. The total sales impact of LMP could be underestimated by 54% if excluding the delayed sales impact and only including the contemporaneous impact. These findings are new to the literature and often neglected in mobile promotion practices, proffering novel implications on the sales value of LMP in the mobile era.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0586","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of location-based mobile promotions and their impact on sales without addressing any social justice or ethical themes.

The fundamental debate centers on trade-offs inherent in disclosing information that society needs, but that can also be used for nefarious purposes. Using information security as a research context, our empirical study examines the adoption of software vulnerabilities by a population of attackers. We compare attacks based on software vulnerabilities disclosed through full-disclosure and limited-disclosure mechanisms. We find that full disclosure accelerates the diffusion of attacks, increases the penetration of attacks within the target population, and increases the risk of first attack after the vulnerability is reported. Interestingly, the effect of full disclosure is greater during periods when there are more overall vulnerabilities reported, indicating that attackers may strategically focus on busy periods when the effort of security professionals is spread across many vulnerabilities. Although the aggregate volume of attacks remains unaffected by full disclosure, attacks occur earlier in the life cycle of the vulnerability.

PRAs are a type of Web personalization technology that provides individual consumers with product recommendations based on their product-related needs and preferences expressed explicitly or implicitly. Whereas extant research mainly assumes that such recommendation technologies are designed to benefit consumers and focuses on the positive impact of PRAs on consumers\u2019 decision quality and decision effort, this study represents an early effort to examine PRAs that are designed to produce their recommendations on the basis of benefiting e-commerce merchants (rather than benefiting consumers) and to investigate how the availability and the design of warning messages (a potential detection support mechanism) can enhance consumers\u2019 performance in detecting such biased PRAs. Drawing on signal detection theory, the literature on warning messages, and the literature on message framing, we identified two content design characteristics of warning messages\u2014the inclusion of risk-handling advice and the framing of risk-handling advice\u2014and investigated how they influence consumers\u2019 detection performance. The results of an online experiment reveal that a simple warning message without accompanying advice on how to detect bias is a double-edged sword, because it increases correct detection of biased PRAs (hits) at the cost of increased incorrect detection (false alarms). By contrast, including in warning messages risk-handling advice about how to check for bias (particularly when the advice is framed to emphasize the loss from not following the advice) increases correct detection and, more importantly, also decreases incorrect detection. The patterns of findings are in line with the predictions of signal detection theory. With an enriched understanding of how the availability and the content design of warning messages can assist consumers in the context of PRA-assisted online shopping, the results of this study serve as a basis for future theoretical development and yield valuable insights that can guide practice and the design of effective warning messages.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0592","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['biased', 'warning messages', 'consumer', 'detection', 'risk-handling advice']","The article addresses the issue of bias in product recommendation agents, highlighting the importance of consumer awareness and protection, which aligns with ethical considerations.

Although there is abundant evidence that consumer reviews have a significant impact on product sales, the design of consumer review systems and its impact on review outcomes and product sales have not yet been well examined. This paper analyzes firms\u2019 review system design and product pricing strategies. We formally model two review system design decisions\u2014what rating scale cardinality to use and whether to offer granular review reports. We show that firms\u2019 optimal design and pricing strategies critically depend on contextual characteristics such as product valuation, product mainstream level, and consumer misfit cost. Our results suggest that it is beneficial to host a review system only when the product valuation is higher than a threshold. Furthermore, firms should choose low rating scale cardinality for niche products and high rating scale cardinality for mainstream products. When consumers\u2019 misfit cost is relatively high, including granular reports in the review system enables firms to attract the favorable consumer segment.

Social Capital Attainment Through Conspicuous Consumption in Virtual Environments","Conspicuous consumption affects anyone who cares about social status; it has intrigued sociologists and economists for more than 100 years. The idea that conspicuous consumption can increase social status, as a form of social capital, has been broadly accepted, yet researchers have not been able to test this effect empirically. In this work, we provide empirical evidence by analyzing the digital footprints of purchases and social interactions in different virtual worlds. We use a multimethod approach, such that we both analyze transactional data and conduct a randomized field experiment. Virtual worlds, as artificial laboratories, offer the opportunity to analyze the social capital of their inhabitants, subsequent to their purchase of virtual prestige goods, which provides a means to empirically test hypotheses that would be nearly impossible to test in real-world settings. Our results are consistent with the notion that conspicuous consumption represents an investment in social capital.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0596","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['social capital', 'conspicuous consumption', 'virtual environments']","The article primarily focuses on the economic concept of conspicuous consumption and its relation to social status, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, software firms adopt versioning strategies that are often invariant across different market settings. To explain universal business practice of software versioning, we focus on \u201cinconvenience\u201d or disutility that users experience when software has lower functionality than what they require to accomplish tasks. In our model, users are heterogeneous on marginal valuation for functionality and the required level of functionality such that those with higher valuation have a higher required level of functionality. Users do not derive any additional utility if the software has more functionality than what they require. We show that heterogeneous disutility from underprovisioning of functionality is a sufficient condition for optimality of versioning under fairly general conditions. We also show that, as high-type users\u2019 required level of functionality increases, the firm increases the functionality level of the high version. Yet surprisingly, the firm may decrease the functionality level of the low version if the proportion of high-type users is moderate. On the other hand, as the required level of functionality of low-type users increases, the firm may reduce the functionality level of the low version when the proportion of high-type users is high, though the functionality level of the high version remains the same. Counterintuitively, an increase in the high-type (low-type) users\u2019 required level of functionality negatively (positively) impacts high-type users\u2019 consumer surplus.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0597","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software versioning and user functionality without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Identifying click fraud is generally done in a three-stage process: the service provider (SP) first classifies clicks as fraudulent or not, then the advertiser does the same with a different technology, and if there is a disagreement, the SP examines further and his conclusions are considered binding. The advertiser pays for clicks that are identified as valid in the first two stages or confirmed as valid in the last stage. We model the choice of the identification technologies as a double moral hazard problem. We analyze the case where the PPC is incentive compatible to overcome the moral hazard problem, and examine the question of whether the incentive compatible PPC is sufficient to incentivize the two parties to unilaterally make further improvements to their identification technologies and simultaneously increase their profits. We show that when the cost of the third-stage identification technology is large, which is likely to be the case because of its complexity and use of expensive human experts, the incentive compatible PPC does not support unilateral technological improvements. We then examine a setting where the third-stage identification is delegated to a third party and find that this arrangement can induce unilateral improvements to the identification technologies in the first two stages. Collectively our results show that although the PPC model itself may not induce improvements in the first two stages of click fraud identification, a common arrangement espoused of having a third party resolve disagreements helps make PPC support unilateral technological improvements. Accordingly, we show an indirect benefit to the third-party arrangement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0598","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of payment-per-click models and click fraud identification without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An Investigation of Online Feedback Forums","Organizations are setting up online forums to obtain inputs and feedback from key stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and citizens. Examples of such virtual spaces are online policy deliberation forums (OPDFs) initiated by government organizations to garner citizens\u2019 views on policy issues. Incorporating the inputs from these forums can result in more inclusive policies for societal benefit. Yet, as with other such forums, a common issue facing OPDFs is the sustainability of participation. When examining this issue, previous research has mostly explored the participation antecedents of existing contributors. However, engaging lurkers is also important, because these forums need to compensate for contributor attrition and become more effective with greater reach. Thus motivated, this study develops a model to explain the antecedents of both contributors\u2019 and lurkers\u2019 participation deriving from public participation and information technology-enabled public goods theories. It hypothesizes differences in the antecedents for contributors versus lurkers based primarily on construal level theory. The model was empirically validated through a survey of contributors and lurkers in a nationwide OPDF. The results reveal significant differences in the participation antecedents of the two groups as hypothesized. Specifically, contributors are influenced by political career benefit and political efficacy motives, whereas lurkers\u2019 future participation intention is driven by collective benefits, possession of civic skills, and mobilization. Furthermore, perceived connectivity of the OPDF directly influences participation intention for contributors and indirectly impacts participation intention for both groups via perceived communality. Perceived communality, on the other hand, influences collective and persuasion benefits for both contributors and lurkers. These findings are useful for understanding and promoting participation through differential strategies for contributors and lurkers in OPDFs in particular, and by extension, other feedback or online forums.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0599","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['inclusive', 'societal benefit', 'participation', 'civic skills', 'collective benefits']","The article discusses the importance of inclusivity in online forums and the societal benefits derived from engaging both contributors and lurkers.

Traditionally, users are responsible for running on-premises software; by contrast, a vendor is responsible for running SaaS software, and the SaaS vendor incurs a larger proportion of defect-related costs than a vendor of on-premises software. We examine the effect of this difference on a vendor\u2019s choice of when to release software and the proportion of software defects to fix. Surprisingly, we find that, despite incurring a larger proportion of defect-related costs, it is optimal for the SaaS vendor to release software earlier and with more defects, and to patch a smaller proportion of defects, than the on-premises software vendor. Even though the SaaS vendor incurs higher defect-related costs, he obtains a larger profit than the traditional vendor. In addition, we find that for a vendor who uses the SaaS model, the optimal number of defects after patching may be lower than the socially efficient outcome. This occurs despite the fact that the number of defects after patching in the SaaS model is higher than in the traditional on-premises model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0601","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['defects', 'costs', 'vendor', 'software']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of software release strategies and defect management without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

We propose that acquisition value can be created when an acquirer redeploys its digital resources to its newly acquired businesses and consequently improves their operations.

In this study, we propose two enabling factors pertaining to an acquirer\u2019s IT resource base: IT extensiveness and IT standardization. We argue that the magnitude of digital resource redeployment increases when the acquirer has had extensive use of IT systems within its existing business units and has standardized IT systems across its business units. Moreover, the relative strength of the IT resources of the acquirer, as compared to those of the acquired business, also affects the reuse of the acquirer\u2019s IT resources in its digital resource redeployment activities.

CDS investments can modify lenders\u05f3 payoffs on their loan portfolios by providing insurance on negative credit outcomes. The onset of CDS trading reduces lenders\u05f3 incentives to continuously monitor borrowers and also their demand that borrowers report conservatively. Additionally, borrowers expect CDS-insured lenders to be more intransigent in renegotiations triggered by defaults and covenant violations. Since conservatism can trigger earlier covenant violations, borrowers have heightened incentives to report less conservatively in the post-CDS period. Using a differences-in-differences research design, we observe a decline in borrowing firms\u05f3 reporting conservatism after CDS trade initiation. This effect is more pronounced when reputation costs lenders face from reducing monitoring are lower, when debt contracts outstanding at the time of CDS trade initiation have more financial covenants, and when lenders who monitor borrowers more regularly in the pre-CDS period enter into CDS contracts to hedge their credit exposures.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410114000573","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial practices and market behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that higher third party credit scores, but not the use of accrual accounting, decrease the likelihood of loan denial.

Further, the interest rate benefits from accrual accounting are greatest when the borrower\u05f3s credit score is low and/or the length of its banking relationship with the lender is short.

These results suggest that analysts create value for firms under their coverage by improving their investor recognition and not by monitoring or reducing information asymmetry.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410115000634","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of analyst value creation and market reactions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2015","60","3","Author links open overlay panelMatthew J.

Using mandatory IFRS adoption as an exogenous shock, annual report disclosure improved in the sense that quantity of disclosure increased, boilerplate was reduced, and comparability increased relative to both US and non-US firms.

In this paper, I examine the effect of reputational concerns on communication in a setting where analysts can choose their precision endogenously. Because both misaligned and aligned analysts want investors to trust their reports in the future, both will aim to build a reputation for being aligned. In equilibrium, aligned analysts will acquire more information than misaligned analysts. As a result, investors may favorably update their beliefs about the analysts' type when the report is proven to be accurate. Therefore, both types of analysts will have reputational incentives to communicate truthfully. The paper also derives conditions under which the analysts' reputational concerns have a nonmonotonic impact on aligned analysts' equilibrium precision choices and investors' welfare.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12069","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","[]","The article primarily focuses on reputational concerns and communication in the context of analysts and investors, with no explicit mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

For these easy-to-arbitrage firms, the firms in the highest decile of prior earnings announcement abnormal return (prior earnings surprise), on average, underperform the firms in the lowest decile by 1.59% (1.43%) at their next earnings announcement. Additional analyses are consistent with investors learning about the post-earnings announcement drift anomaly and overcompensating. This study suggests that unsophisticated attempts to profit from a well-known anomaly can significantly reverse a previously documented stock return pattern.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12070","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on market efficiency and behavioral biases of investors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

We examine the stock price behavior of Chinese listed firms around two visible political events\u2014meetings of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and promotions of high-level provincial politicians\u2014that are expected to asymmetrically increase the costs of releasing bad news. The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event. These effects are strongest in the three-month period directly preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism. Additional tests document a significant reduction in published newspaper articles about affected firms in advance of these political events, suggestive of a link between our observed stock price behavior and temporary shifts in the listed firms\u2019 information environment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12071","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['political incentives', 'negative information', 'cronyism']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of political influences on information suppression in firms, with no strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

By restricting mobile communication across a potentially sizable set of local individuals, these restrictions could inhibit local information flow and, in turn, the market activity of stocks headquartered in enforcement states. We first document a decline in Google search activity for local stocks when restrictions take effect, suggesting that constraints on mobile communication significantly affect individuals\u2019 information search activity. We further find significant declines in local trading volume when restrictions are enforced. This drop in liquidity is (1) attenuated when laws provide substitutive means of mobile communication and (2) magnified when locals have long car commutes and when their daily commutes overlap with regular exchange hours. Moreover, trading volume suffers the most for local stocks with lower institutional ownership, less analyst coverage, and more intangible information. Additional analyses show lower intraday volume during local commute times when mobile connectivity is constrained. Together, our results suggest that local information and local investors matter in stock markets and that mobile communication is an important mechanism through which these elements operate to affect liquidity and price discovery.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12077","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['local information flow', 'distracted driving', 'mobile communication']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of mobile communication and its impact on local investor activity rather than addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize that DELR increases vulnerability to downside risk by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy and by degrading bank transparency, which increases financing frictions and opportunities for risk-shifting. We find that DELR is associated with higher correlations between bank-level illiquidity and both aggregate banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity risks) during recessions, suggesting that high DELR banks as a group may simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced opportunities for risk-shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect to downside risk, we find that during recessions DELR is associated with significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find that DELR is associated with significantly higher codependence between downside risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can translate into systemic risk by virtue of DELR creating a common source of risk vulnerability across high DELR banks simultaneously, which leads to risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as part of a herd.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12079","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of banking risk and financial metrics without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In laboratory markets, we test the effects of salient earnings metrics, which vary in how they combine persistent and transitory elements, on investor information search, beliefs about value, offers to trade, and market price efficiency. We find that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes traders to search unnecessarily for further information about these elements and to overestimate their effect on fundamental value relative to a rational benchmark. In contrast, separately displaying persistent elements in earnings increases the accuracy of traders\u2019 value estimates. Prices generally reflect traders\u2019 beliefs about value, and prices are most efficient when transitory elements are excluded from earnings metrics entirely. Our study contributes to research on salience effects in financial reporting by showing that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes inefficient information search and biased beliefs about value that can aggregate to affect market prices. We also contribute to research in experimental markets by showing that redundant disclosure is not always beneficial; redundant disclosure of transitory earnings elements, in particular, appears to have negative consequences for investor behavior and market efficiency.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12080","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and market efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Second, we show that the relation between the market reaction to M&A deal announcements and the likelihood of deal completion becomes stronger after IFRS adoption. Third, we find significant improvements in post-acquisition operating and stock return performance post-IFRS adoption. These results are more pronounced for firms that experienced significant increases in foreign institutional ownership around IFRS adoption, especially when these foreign investors are from countries that matter for the firm\u2019s growth opportunities.

An Analysis of Regular-Hour and After-Hours Revisions","Analysts often update their recommendations following corporate news. Questions have been raised regarding analysts\u2019 ability to generate new information beyond recent corporate events. Employing a comprehensive database on corporate news, we show that only a small minority, or 27.9%, of all recommendation revisions directionally confirm the information in the preceding corporate events and even these \u201cconfirming revisions\u201d facilitate the information discovery of corporate events and thus cannot simply be dismissed as \u201cpiggybacking.\u201d Our analysis further shows that analysts not only facilitate price discovery to corporate news through issuing trending revisions but also help reverse prevailing market sentiments following corporate news by issuing contrarian revisions. Our study is the first to investigate short-window intraday market reactions to revisions issued after hours, which account for 70% of all recommendation revisions in our sample period. Analysts\u2019 incentives to issue revisions after hours appear to reflect demands from large institutional clients, who dominate after-hours trading. More importantly, we show that the after-hours revisions are associated with significantly greater price reactions and different price reaction patterns than revisions issued during regular trading hours. Collectively, our evidence indicates that analysts are a significant source of new information beyond recent corporate news and they also help shape the market's assessment of corporate disclosures.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12083","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of analyst stock recommendations and market reactions, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

We explore the effects of two market scenarios that have been the focus of policy discussions: mandatory audit firm rotation and further supply concentration due to the exit of a \u201cBig 4\u201d audit firm. To do so, we first estimate publicly traded firms' demand for auditing services, allowing the services provided by each of the Big\u00a04 to be differentiated products. We then use those estimates to calculate how each scenario would affect client firms' consumer surplus. We estimate that, for U.S.\u00a0publicly trade firms, mandatory audit firm rotation would induce consumer surplus losses of approximately $2.7 billion if rotation were required after 10 years and $4.7\u20135.0 billion if after only four years. We find similarly that exit by one of the Big\u00a04 would reduce client firms' surplus by $1.4\u20131.8 billion. These estimates reflect only the value of firms' lost options to hire the exiting audit firm; they do not include likely fee increases resulting from less competition among audit firms. The latter could result in audit fee increases between $0.75\u20131.3 billion per year for mandatory rotation and $0.47\u20130.58 billion per year for the disappearance of a Big\u00a04 audit firm.

In addition, I find that the improvement in internal capital market efficiency was greater for firms that suffered more severe agency problems before the adoption of SFAS 131 and also for firms whose managers faced stronger incentives to improve efficiency after the adoption of SFAS 131.

We argue that incentive contracts and selection can be both complements and substitutes conditional on the contracting difficulty faced by the firm. We examine these control choices in a setting where contracting difficulties arise due to the firm's choice of strategy and from the volatility created by the firm's external environment. We select a firm's commitment to organizational learning (OL) as our strategic choice variable as this provides a useful proxy for identifying settings where explicit incentive contracting is difficult. The results show that, as firms become increasingly committed to OL, incentive contracts and employee selection operate as complements. However, with a high commitment to OL and an increasing level of external volatility, contracting on performance measures will become less effective. In this context, our results indicate that there is a substitution effect toward employee selection.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12090","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","[]","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of employee selection and incentive contracts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Those properties include the increased choice among accounting rules IFRS gives to managers, enhanced rule-making uncertainty, and increased emphasis on fair value accounting. Consistent with reduced contractibility of IFRS financial statement information, we find a significant reduction in accounting-based debt covenants following mandatory IFRS adoption. The reduction in accounting covenant use is associated with measures of the difference between prior domestic standards and IFRS. Because IFRS adoption changed financial reporting in many ways simultaneously, it is difficult to trace the decline in accounting covenant use to individual IFRS properties, though we report larger declines in accounting covenant use in banks, which have a higher proportion of assets and liabilities that are fair-valued. Our findings are better explained by reduced contractibility than by increased transparency, which would predict reduced nonaccounting covenant use as well, whereas we observe increases. Overall, we conclude that IFRS rules sacrifice debt contracting usefulness to achieve other objectives, such as provision of accounting information relevant to valuation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12095","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['transparency', 'fair value', 'accounting']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting under IFRS, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Younger people, who view their future as extensive, gain more happiness from extraordinary experiences; however, ordinary experiences become increasingly associated with happiness as people get older, such that they produce as much happiness as extraordinary experiences when individuals have limited time remaining. Self-definition drives these effects: although extraordinary experiences are self-defining throughout one's life span, as people get older they increasingly define themselves by the ordinary experiences that comprise their daily lives.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/1/1810271","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['happiness', 'experiences', 'self-definition']","The article focuses on the relationship between experiences and happiness without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

The current research demonstrates that price information, traditionally considered as a feasibility cue, can increase consumers' near-future preference toward products with greater functionality despite their low convenience, leading to preference consistency over time. As the underlying mechanism, price information increases the functionality importance for near-future decisions due to consumers' enhanced value-seeking tendency when seeing price and their lay belief that greater functionality represents higher value. Further, when consumers are led to believe that greater convenience represents higher value, price and the value-seeking tendency result in a greater preference toward easy-to-use products for the distant future and lead to preference consistency across time as well.

Sadness heightens a person's sensitivity to the potentially harmful consequences of indulgent consumption, which decreases indulgence when a hedonic eating goal is salient. As sadness is often associated with a loss, this protective function is geared toward preventing future losses. The execution of this function is mitigated by feelings of safety, a counterforce to concerns about the harmful consequences of goal pursuit. Alternatively, when a hedonic eating goal is not salient, or a salient goal does not have harmful consequences, sadness results in emotion regulation (i.e., indulging as a means of feeling better). This conceptualization and findings show that the effects of emotions on indulgent consumption can be goal-dependent, and that emotions can aid consumers in the balancing of long-term goals and well-being.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/135/1810276","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['emotion', 'indulgent consumption', 'well-being']","The article primarily focuses on the psychological aspects of consumption related to emotions rather than social justice or equity themes.

The current research suggests that for fear, the relationship may be more positive. Since people cope with fear through affiliation with others, in the absence of other individuals, consumers may seek affiliation with an available brand. This, in turn, will enhance emotional attachment to that brand. Four studies demonstrate that consumers who experience fear in the presence of a brand feel greater emotional brand attachment than consumers who experience other emotions such as happiness, sadness, or excitement. The findings from the research advance understanding of consumer-brand relationships by demonstrating that relationships between consumers and brands are not merely metaphorical.

Support for this proposition emerges in studies examining giver and receiver mind-sets, as well as giver and receiver evaluations of gifts. Furthermore, givers do not choose gifts that maximize receiver happiness or other relationship goals even though givers believe they are doing so.

Because high power is associated with a readiness to act, and switching behavior often requires taking action in some form, inducing consumers to feel powerful is hypothesized to increase consumer switching. Multiple experiments provide support for this perspective along with evidence for the process via both moderation and mediation. This works contributes to the consumer switching literature by demonstrating power as a new psychological catalyst for switching behavior. This work also adds to the power literature by distinguishing between goal priming and semantic priming accounts of the action orientation of high power. Specifically, consistent with a goal priming account, engaging in action is found to sate consumers' subsequent need for action as opposed to maintain or increase consumers' desire to act, as might be predicted from a semantic priming account.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/183/1810285","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and power dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Despite the fact that negative information is frequently valued by those receiving it, baldly declaring negative information may come with social costs to both communicator and receiver. For this reason, communicators sometimes soften pronouncements of bad news by couching them in dispreferred markers, including phrases such as, \u201cI'll be honest,\u201d \u201cGod bless it,\u201d or \u201cI don't want to be mean, but \u2026\u201d The present work identified and tested in five experiments a phenomenon termed the dispreferred marker effect, in which consumers evaluate communicators who use dispreferred markers as more credible and likable than communicators who assert the same information without dispreferred markers. We further found that the dispreferred marker effect can spill over to evaluations of the product being reviewed, increasing willingness to pay and influencing evaluations of the credibility and likability of the evaluated product's personality.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/197/1810287","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['communication', 'credibility', 'consumer']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of word-of-mouth communication and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Here four controlled experiments show that adding dish-specific calorie information to menus (calorie posting) tends to result in lower-calorie choices. However, additionally grouping low-calorie dishes into a single \u201clow-calorie\u201d category (calorie organizing) ironically diminishes the positive effects of calorie posting. This outcome appears to be caused by the effect that grouping low-calorie options has on consumers' consideration sets. When choosing from a calorie-organized menu, consumers are more likely to filter out low-calorie options in the early noncompensatory screening stages of the decision process and, consequently, are less likely to choose low-calorie options. This result disappears when consumers deliberate longer before choosing. These results are important for consumer welfare as well-intentioned restaurateurs (policy makers) may be tempted to institute (mandate) the calorie organization of menus, inadvertently resulting in consumers choosing higher-calorie meals.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/213/1810291","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['consumer welfare', 'calorie information', 'low-calorie options']","The article discusses consumer welfare and the impact of calorie information on food choices, which touches on ethical considerations in marketing.

Nonconforming behaviors, as costly and visible signals, can act as a particular form of conspicuous consumption and lead to positive inferences of status and competence in the eyes of others. A series of studies demonstrates that people confer higher status and competence to nonconforming rather than conforming individuals. These positive inferences derived from signals of nonconformity are mediated by perceived autonomy and moderated by individual differences in need for uniqueness in the observers. An investigation of boundary conditions demonstrates that the positive inferences disappear when the observer is unfamiliar with the environment, when the nonconforming behavior is depicted as unintentional, and in the absence of expected norms and shared standards of formal conduct.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/1/35/1810298","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['nonconformity', 'status', 'competence']","The article explores nonconforming behaviors and their impact on perceptions of status and competence, which touches on themes of individuality and social norms.

However, yielding to impulses may not always be maladaptive. This research suggests that when people are depleted, they feel more vulnerable when encountering potential danger and are therefore more likely to engage in self-protection. Across five studies, depleted (vs. nondepleted) participants reported being less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as having unprotected sex (study 1) and more likely to engage in risk-reduction behaviors such as getting tested for kidney diseases and chlamydia (studies 2 and 3). Depleted individuals also preferred products that emphasize safety (studies 4 and 5). Perceived vulnerability is shown to mediate the effect of depletion on self-protective behavior (studies 1 and 2).

This interaction holds in both individualistic (i.e., the United States) and collectivistic (i.e., China) nations and seems driven by a belief system. For interdependents, the prospect of helping needy in-group (relative to out-group) members heightens the belief that helping others contributes to their own personal happiness, which in turn increases their propensity to act benevolently.

Accordingly, the consumer identity literature emphasizes the importance of a clear fit between brands and target identities, suggesting that identity marketing that explicitly links brands to consumer identity should be most effective. In contrast, five studies demonstrate that explicit identity-marketing messages can backfire. Messages that explicitly connect a particular brand to consumer identity increase the salience of external determinants of behavior, reducing consumers' perceptions of agency in identity expression. Hence, compared to messages that merely reference consumer identity, messages that explicitly define identity expression reduce purchase likelihood, despite more clearly conveying identity relevance. These findings highlight the need to consider consumers' need for agency in addition to their drive for self-definition and expression through consumption, offering a foundation to examine both the risks and the rewards of identity marketing.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/294/2907550","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['identity', 'agency', 'consumer', 'expression', 'marketing']","The article discusses the implications of identity marketing on consumer agency, highlighting the importance of self-definition and expression.

Specifically, five experiments document a category size bias in which consumers perceive an outcome as more likely to occur when it is categorized with many rather than few alternative possibilities, even when the grouping criterion is irrelevant and the objective probability of each outcome is identical. For example, participants in one study irrationally predicted being more likely to win a lottery if their ticket color matched many (vs. few) of the other gamblers' tickets\u2014and wagered nearly 25% more as a result.

Prior research on kindchenschema (baby schema) has found that exposure to cute babies or baby animals leads to more careful behavior (see the study by Sherman, Haidt, and Coan), suggesting restraint. The present research uncovers the opposite: consumers become more indulgent in their behavior after exposure to whimsically cute products. Drawing from research on cognitive priming, kindchenschema, anthropomorphization, indulgence, and regulatory focus, this research posits that exposure to whimsically cute products primes mental representations of fun, increasing consumers' focus on approaching self-rewards and making consumers more likely to choose indulgent options. These effects do not emerge for kindchenschema cute stimuli, since they prime mental representations of vulnerability and caretaking. Four empirical studies provide evidence for the proposed effects and their underlying process.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/326/2907555","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to cute products and indulgent consumption without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

Lay intuition, common marketing practice, and extant literature all suggest that more visual impressions help consumers distinguish products. This research shows that the opposite can occur. Rather than highlighting differences, seeing more pictures of products being compared can obfuscate perceptions, reduce distinctiveness and attractiveness of products, and increase choice uncertainty. Six experiments demonstrate that this \u201cproduct-agnosia\u201d effect is driven by shifts in the perceptual focus level of visual information processing. More visual impressions increased component-oriented and decreased gestalt-oriented perceptual focus, which undermined the distinctiveness of products distinguished on a gestalt level (e.g., by style). The effect reversed for products distinguished on a component level (e.g., by technical features). Overall, the efficacy of \u201cshowing more\u201d depended on matching consumers' visual-processing style and the level (gestalt vs. component) at which products are differentiated.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/342/2907558","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer choice and visual processing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The current research reports seven studies showing that in joint decisions, homogeneous high self-control pairs make less indulgent choices than both homogeneous low self-control and mixed pairs. However, there is no difference in the self-regulatory patterns of the latter two dyad types: having one high self-control partner in a dyad does not lead to more restraint than having none. The authors argue that this pattern exists because higher self-control individuals tend to prioritize prorelationship behaviors over their personal preference for restraint. Therefore, they assent to the lower self-control partner's more indulgent preferences. Consistent with this explanation, results suggest that interventions that change individuals' prorelationship motivation can alter this pattern. Given the range of decisions consumers may make in couples or pairs, this research has implications for consumers, marketers, and public-policy makers.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/361/2907560","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-control', 'joint decisions', 'prorelationship']","The article discusses decision-making in dyads, focusing on self-control and prorelationship behaviors, which touch on social dynamics but do not strongly emphasize social justice or equity themes.

This research introduces a critical theoretical moderator of power's effects by promoting the idea that power is accompanied by both an experience (how it feels to have or lack power) and expectations (schemas and scripts as to how those with or without power behave). In some cases, the psychological experience of power predisposes people to behave one way, whereas attention to the expectations of power suggests behaving in another way. As a consequence, power's effects for consumer behavior can hinge on consumers' focus. Specifically, a focus on the experience or expectations of power critically moderates how power affects both information processing and status seeking. However, as the experience of power incites a desire to act, and the powerful are expected to act, power produces more action regardless of focus. These findings provide a new lens on power and have important implications for consumer behavior.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/381/2907562","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['power', 'consumer behavior', 'expectations', 'experience']","The article discusses the concept of power and its implications for consumer behavior, which touches on themes of social dynamics and expectations.

The goals that they have when they engage in such imagery (e.g., a goal to construct a story of the experience vs. a goal to acquire information) can influence how the mental images they generate affect judgments. When pictures from very different perspectives are provided, those trying to imagine themselves in the scene in order to create a story of the experience have to shift visual perspectives in order to imagine the entire experience. This shift in visual perspective can increase processing difficulty and decrease evaluations of the product or service being described.

Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/451/2907567","articles","JCR","Marketing","9","['systemic restricted choice', 'minority consumers', 'self-concept', 'discrimination', 'self-esteem']","The article focuses on the systemic barriers faced by racial and ethnic minority consumers, emphasizing themes of discrimination and self-concept, which align strongly with social justice and equity.

Autonomy seems appropriate, and hence increases perceptions of coolness, when a behavior diverges from a norm considered unnecessary or illegitimate, when the autonomy is bounded (i.e., deviations are small or occasional rather than large or perpetual), and when the consumer views social norms as being overly repressive. A final experiment further supports the connection between autonomy and coolness and illustrates that coolness is distinct from liking by showing that whether a consumer has a goal to express autonomy moderates preference for cool brands.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/2/543/2907572","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['autonomy', 'social norms', 'coolness']","The article explores the concept of autonomy in relation to consumer perceptions, touching on social norms and their repressive nature.

However, at a micro-social level, individuals negotiate boundaries between classifications in order to cope with symbolic pollution. Consumers define their domestic classifications through a juxtaposition of micro-practices, which does not necessarily create a hierarchically ordered system but which enables these consumers to avoid anomalies and transgressions. Furthermore, respondents are willing to break tidiness rules on specific occasions because the danger-beliefs associated with transgression are context-dependent.

When the purpose of saving is no longer to accumulate money but to spend it on a status-related product, the basic effect is reversed, and those who feel powerless save more. Further, if money can no longer aid in maintaining one's current state because power is already secure or because power is maintained by accumulating an alternative resource (i.e., knowledge), the effect of feeling powerful on saving disappears.

In four studies, this effect is demonstrated in the domains of eating, spending, and studying, and alternative processes are ruled out. Furthermore, it is shown that perceptions of goal progress drive impulsive (vs. nonimpulsive) people's greater likelihood of engaging in behavior inconsistent with their regulatory goal.

Accordingly, we find that preschoolers (3\u20135.5 years old) rated crackers as less tasty and consumed fewer of them when the crackers were presented as instrumental to achieving a health goal (studies 1\u20132). In addition, preschoolers consumed fewer carrots and crackers when these were presented as instrumental to knowing how to read (study 3) and to count (studies 4\u20135).

Supporting the role of pain of payment in this process, we show that the bottom dollar effect increases as effort required to earn budgetary resources increases, decreases in the presence of windfall gains, and decreases when there is less time between budget exhaustion and replenishment.

Although moral identity tends to have a positive effect on prosocial behavior, moral identity does not unconditionally enhance charitable giving. Four studies demonstrate that moral identity decreases donations when recipients are responsible for their plight. Mediation analysis reveals that empathy and justice underlie these effects such that moral identity increases donations for recipients with low plight responsibility through increased empathy, but moral identity decreases donations to recipients with high plight responsibility due to perceptions of justice. Importantly, donations to recipients who are responsible for their plight can be enhanced when donors' immorality is made salient, evoking empathy for recipients, particularly among donors with high moral identity.

The current research asked whether its effectiveness is driven by its weakening of the desire for money. Six experiments demonstrated that feeling nostalgic decreased people's desire for money. Using multiple operationalizations of desire for money, nostalgia (vs. neutral) condition participants were willing to pay more for products (experiment 1), parted with more money but not more time (experiment 2), valued money less (experiments 3 and 4), were willing to put less effort into obtaining money (experiment 5), and drew smaller coins (experiment 6). Process evidence indicated that nostalgia's weakening of the desire for money was due to its capacity to foster social connectedness (experiments 5 and 6). Implications for price sensitivity, willingness to pay, consumer spending, and donation behavior are discussed.

Such high-effort products reassure individuals that desired outcomes are possible while also enabling them to feel as if they have driven their own outcomes. We also identify important boundary conditions, finding that both the nature of individuals' thoughts about control and their perceived rate of progress toward goals are important factors in the desire to exert increased effort.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/3/730/2907536","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['control', 'effort', 'goals']","The article discusses consumer behavior related to personal control and effort but lacks a focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Seven studies provide evidence of a rapid wear-off bias in judgments of pharmacological products: consumers infer that duration of product efficacy is dependent on concurrent task difficulty, such that relatively more difficult tasks lead to faster product wear-off. This bias appears to be grounded in consumers' incorrect application of a mental model about substance wear-off based on their experiences with, and beliefs about, various physical and biological phenomena. Results indicate that the rapid wear-off bias affects consumption frequency and may thus contribute to overdosing of widely available pharmacological products. Further, manufacturers' intake instructions in an interval format (e.g., \u201cTake one pill every 2\u20134 hours\u201d) are shown to signal that efficacy is task dependent and reinforce the bias.

The current research shows that, while consumers' intuitions are in line with this prediction, their actual emotional experiences are surprisingly insensitive to the distancing information. For instance, readers of a sad story overestimated how much their emotional reaction would be reduced by knowing that it described a fictional event. Similarly, game participants overestimated how much their excitement about winning a prize would be dampened by knowing that the prize would only be available later. We propose that actual readers and prize winners were too absorbed by the hedonic experience to incorporate the distancing information, resulting in surprisingly strong affective reactions to fictional stories and delayed prizes.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/3/794/2907540","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer emotional reactions to fictional narratives and delayed rewards without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In particular, consumers are less likely to purchase a green product when they perceive that the company intentionally made the product better for the environment compared to when the same environmental benefit occurred as an unintended side effect. This result is explained by consumers' lay theories about resource allocation: intended (vs. unintended) green enhancements lead consumers to assume that the company diverted resources away from product quality, which in turn drives a reduction in purchase interest.

Building on the sociology of governmentality, we introduce four processes of consumer responsibilization that, together, comprise the P.A.C.T. routine (personalization, authorization, capabilization, and transformation).

Experiment 1 establishes this association via an Implicit Association Test. On the basis of this association, experiments 2 and 3 show that BW (vs. color) imagery promotes high-level (vs. low-level) construal, leading to sorting objects on the basis of high-level (vs. low-level) features, segmenting behaviors into broader (vs. narrower) units, and interpreting actions as ends (vs. means). Extending this effect into consumer decision making, experiments 4 and 5 further show that consumers presented with BW (vs. color) product pictures weight primary and essential (vs. secondary and superficial) product features more and prefer an option that excels on those features.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/4/1015/2907547","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the cognitive effects of color imagery in marketing without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In subsequent unrelated judgments, guilt increased reliance on feasibility over desirability attributes and emphasized secondary rather than primary features. Shame led to the opposite pattern. Guilt's tendency to draw behavior-specific appraisals activates local appraisal tendencies and endows lower construal levels, whereas shame's tendency to implicate the entire self activates global appraisal tendencies and endows consumers with higher construal levels. As a boundary condition to the core effect, the results showed that the differences between guilt and shame only held when the emotions arose from actions rather than from inaction situations.

Researchers have shown that consumers prefer moderately incongruent products, while being adverse to extremely incongruent products. Evidence from three studies suggests that this phenomenon is highly influenced by a consumer's state of arousal. Specifically, low arousal decreases preference for moderate incongruity while increasing preference for extreme incongruity, whereas high arousal decreases preference for any form of incongruity. Underlying these effects are discrete emotional states brought on by a physiological response to incongruity. Varying arousal subsequently varies the severity of the emotion, be it negative (anxiety) or positive (curiosity), which in turn varies evaluations for the product. This suggests that creating excitement around a product launch may be good for incremental innovation, but it may not be a good idea for something truly innovative.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/4/1108/2907557","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product evaluation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Consumers' preferences for product bundles are more pronounced in a joint evaluation mode, where the bundle is directly contrasted to its single counterpart (i.e., the bundle without its add-on), than in a separate evaluation mode, where the bundle is evaluated in isolation. An attentional explanation is suggested: consumers pay more attention to the unique features of a product bundle (i.e., the add-on) and, therefore, prefer the bundle more strongly in joint rather than in separate evaluation. This account bears relevance for Weaver, Garcia, and Schwarz's presenter's paradox, according to which presenters (i.e., people deciding what to offer to others) prefer bundle options, whereas evaluators (i.e., people deciding what to get for themselves) prefer single options. In the original research, presenters and evaluators provided judgments in joint and separate evaluation, respectively. Disentangling role (presenter vs. evaluator) and evaluation mode, our results show that, independent of role, people prefer bundle over single options in joint evaluations and are largely indifferent in separate evaluations. Thus, a substantial part of the original findings is attributable to evaluation mode.

The current research, however, demonstrates that when consumers use visualization to evaluate new products, the value of concrete versus abstract visualization is dependent on the temporal perspective taken by the consumer. Specifically, concrete information is beneficial when product visualization is retrospective in nature (i.e., focused on the past), whereas abstract information is found to be more helpful when product visualization is anticipatory in nature (i.e., geared toward the future). This occurs because the match between visualization aids and consumers' temporal construal facilitates the extent of imagery processing realized, which, in turn, enhances new product evaluation. When the new product is very difficult to visualize, this pattern of effects is attenuated. Further, the effect is reversed when the product is highly familiar (i.e., not a new product), as preexisting memories are shown to hinder imagery processing.

However, in the presence of salient alternatives, individuals infer that they have developed new tastes, and thus a longer nonconsumption period results in a weaker desire for the unconsumed good. Five studies support this model across nonconsumption of various goods: food from home when attending college (study 1); chametz food during the Passover holiday (study 2); social media (i.e., abstaining from Facebook; study 3); and cultural foods (i.e., forgoing Japanese food, study 4; and Thai food, study 5).

Building on this work, the current research shows that consumers track not just individual events but also \u201ccategories\u201d of events. Consequently, a person who visits a modern art gallery, a classic art gallery, the opera, and a symphony concert could either construe these as four distinct experiences or as two categories of experiences (art galleries and musical performances). Consumers seem to naturally consider experiential categories. For positive experiences, consumers are reluctant to choose in a way that eliminates categories, but the opposite is true for negative experiences. People may do this because eliminating categories leads to a greater subjective feeling of making progress in a hedonic experience.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/4/965/2907577","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and maximizing enjoyment without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In other product categories, high-priced brands are consistently of high quality, but quality of low-priced brands varies widely. Three experiments demonstrate that such heteroscedasticity leads to more extreme price-based quality predictions. This finding suggests that quality inferences do not only stem from what consumers have learned about the average level of quality at different price points through exemplar memory or rule abstraction. Instead, quality predictions are also based on learning about the covariation between price and quality. That is, consumers inappropriately conflate the conditional mean of quality with the predictability of quality. We discuss implications for theories of quantitative cue learning and selective information processing, for pricing strategies and luxury branding, and for our understanding of the emergence and persistence of erroneous beliefs and stereotypes beyond the consumer realm.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/4/978/2907578","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article develops a preliminary theory of marketplace sentiments. Defined as collectively shared emotional dispositions, sentiments can be grouped into three function-based categories: contempt for villains, concern for victims, and celebration of heroes. Marketplace actors such as activists, brands, and consumers have a variety of motives and methods for producing and reproducing sentiments. Activists plant, amplify, and hyper-perform sentiments to recruit consumers and discipline institutions. Brands carefully select, calibrate, and broadcast sentiments to entertain consumers and promote products. Consumers learn, experience, and communicate sentiments to commune and individuate in society. The emergent theory of marketplace sentiments (1) advances a sociocultural perspective on consumer emotion, (2) elevates the theoretical significance of emotional observations in cultural studies, (3) offers a sentiment-based understanding of the power of ideology, (4) indicates how activist sentiments can paradoxically benefit from brand co-optation, and (5) calls for human input in big data sentiment analysis. More broadly, the article proposes that cultures are systems of discourses, sentiments, and practices wherein discourses legitimize sentiments and practices, sentiments energize discourses and practices, and practices materialize discourses and sentiments.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/4/995/2907579","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['activists', 'sentiments', 'consumer culture', 'ideology', 'emotional']","The article discusses the role of marketplace sentiments, including the influence of activists and the emotional dimensions of consumer culture, which aligns with moderate woke themes related to social dynamics and cultural critique.

Six studies, which use social media and online reviews as stimuli, show that humorous complaints benefit people who want to warn, entertain, and make a favorable impression on others. Further, in contrast to the belief that humor is beneficial but consistent with the benign violation theory, humor makes complaints seem more positive (by making an expression of dissatisfaction seem okay), but makes praise seem more negative (by making an expression of satisfaction seem wrong in some way). Finally, a benign violation approach perspective also reveals that complaining humorously has costs.

Although such within-domain compensation can serve as a psychological salve to repair the self, the current research suggests that sometimes this form of compensation can have ill effects. Specifically, engaging in within-domain compensation can trigger ruminative thinking about the threat. As a consequence, performance in subsequent tasks that require self-regulation is undermined. In support of this hypothesis, multiple experiments demonstrate that within-domain compensation impairs subsequent self-regulation on behaviors ranging from resisting tempting but unhealthy food to performing cognitively taxing tasks. Evidence that within-domain compensation fosters ruminative thought, as well as documentation of boundary conditions, is provided.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/5/1186/2962091","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-regulation', 'psychological threat', 'compensation']","The article focuses primarily on psychological mechanisms related to consumer behavior rather than social justice or equity themes.

We distinguish two common strategies: efficiency planning yields savings by stretching the resource, whereas priority planning does so by sacrificing less important goals. Using a variety of methods to explore both financial and time planning, we investigate how the two types of planning differ, how they vary with constraint, and how they interrelate. Relative to efficiency planning, priority planning is perceived as yielding larger one-time savings, but it feels more costly because it requires trade-offs within-resource (e.g., money for money) as opposed to cross-resource (e.g., time for money). As constraint increases and greater resource savings are required, prioritization becomes more likely. However, the shift to prioritization is often insufficient, and consumers tend to react to insufficient prioritization dysfunctionally, making a bad situation worse. Budgeting helps consumers behave more adaptively. Budgeters respond to constraint with more priority planning than nonbudgeters, and they report fewer dysfunctional behaviors, like overspending and impulsive shopping.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/5/1204/2962092","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['constraint', 'efficiency', 'prioritization']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior related to resource management and planning strategies, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Although goal monitoring is known to be a critical step in self-control for successful goal pursuit, little research investigates whether consumers accurately monitor goal progress. Seven experiments demonstrate that consumers tend to show a progress bias in goal monitoring, perceiving that goal-consistent behaviors (e.g., saving $45) help progress more than goal-inconsistent behaviors of the equivalent size (e.g., spending $45) hurt it. Expectations of goal attainment moderate the progress bias; reducing the expectation that the goal will be reached reduces the tendency to perceive goal-consistent behaviors to have a larger impact on goal progress than equivalent goal-inconsistent behaviors.

Specifically, compared to an interdependent self-construal, an independent self-construal increases the relative preference for affectively superior options as opposed to cognitively superior options (experiments 1A and 1B) and strengthens the effects of incidental mood on evaluations (experiment 2). Further, valuations of the decision outcome increase when independent (interdependent) consumers adopt a feeling-based (reason-based) decision strategy (experiment 3). Finally, these effects are moderated by decision focus (whether the decision is made for oneself or for others; experiment 4) and need for justification during decision making (experiment 5).

Attribution for Dispersion in Online Word of MouthGet access","The widespread availability of online word of mouth (WOM) enables modern consumers to assess not only the opinions of others about products and services, but also the extent to which those opinions are consistent or dispersive. Despite longstanding calls for greater understanding of mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its association with risk.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/41/6/1509/2379584","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['opinions', 'diversity', 'consumer']","The article discusses consumer opinions and the diversity of those opinions in the context of online word of mouth, but it does not emphasize social justice or critical theory.

Many firms have high and low leverage at different times, but few keep debt-to-assets ratios consistently above 0.500. Capital structure stability is the exception, not the rule, occurs primarily at low leverage, and is virtually always temporary, with many firms abandoning low leverage during the post-war boom.

While banks honored credit lines drawn by firms during the 2007 to 2009 crisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit, large support from the government and government-sponsored agencies. At the onset of the crisis, aggregate deposit inflows into banks weakened and their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened. These patterns were pronounced at banks with greater undrawn commitments.

Firms\u2019 CP issuance is driven by a desire to minimize transaction costs associated with raising capital for new investment. We show that firms with high rollover risk are less likely to enter the CP market, borrow less CP, and borrow more from bank credit lines.

We uncover a size factor in the component of bank returns that is orthogonal to the standard risk factors, including small minus big, which has the right covariance with bank returns to explain the average risk-adjusted returns. This factor measures size-dependent exposure to bank-specific tail risk.

Our model shows that, when a bank faces strong loan demand but limited deposit market power, this tax asymmetry creates an incentive to sell loans despite less-efficient screening and monitoring of sold loans. Moreover, loan-selling increases as a bank's corporate income tax rate and capital requirement rise. Our empirical tests show that U.S. commercial banks sell more of their mortgages when they operate in states that impose higher corporate income taxes. A policy implication is that tax-induced loan-selling will rise if banks\u2019 required equity capital increases.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12157","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate taxes and securitization without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

With recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command high-risk premia in asset markets.

These models predict that the term structures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespecified interval) are also upward sloping. However, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. This discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios.

The model considers several dimensions of illiquidity. First, following a liquidity shock, the controlling blockholder is forced to sell, possibly to a less efficient acquirer. Second, this sale may occur at a fire sale price. Third, absent a liquidity shock, a trade occurs only if a potential buyer arrives. Using a structural estimation approach and U.S. data on trades of controlling blocks of public corporations, we estimate the value of control, blockholders' marketability discount, and dispersed shareholders' illiquidity-spillover discount.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12207","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the valuation of illiquidity in controlling stakes, without any mention of socially progressive themes, DEI, or ethical considerations."],["2015","70","4","ITAY GOLDSTEIN,\u00a0\n                     ITAY GOLDSTEINSearch for more papers by this authorLIYAN YANG,\u00a0\n                     LIYAN YANG\n                     Itay Goldstein is with Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and Liyan Yang is with Joseph L.

We identify a source for strategic complementarities in trading and information acquisition: aggressive trading on information about one fundamental reduces uncertainty in trading on information about the other fundamental, encouraging more trading and information acquisition on that fundamental. This tends to amplify the effect of exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to complementarities, greater diversity of information in the economy improves price informativeness.

In a setting where the government is the only issuer of such riskless paper, it trades off the monetary premium associated with short-term debt against the refinancing risk implied by the need to roll over its debt more often. We extend the model to allow private financial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of short-term money-like claims. We argue that, if there are negative externalities associated with private money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short maturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector's use of short-term debt.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12253","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of government debt maturity and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques.

We find that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse selection and of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are positively impacted.

Recall is higher for investors with greater incentives to monitor, for firms with poor performance or weak governance, and for proposals where returns to governance are likely higher.

Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12286","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial concepts and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a model of informed trading with disclosure and test its predictions using the May 2004 SEC regulation requiring more frequent disclosure. Stocks with higher fund ownership, especially those held by more informed funds or subject to greater information asymmetry, experience larger increases in liquidity after the regulation change. More informed funds, especially those holding stocks with greater information asymmetry, experience greater performance deterioration after the regulation change. Overall, mandatory disclosure improves stock liquidity but imposes costs on informed investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12245","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio disclosure and its impact on stock liquidity and performance, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The likelihood of receiving a successful takeover bid is sharply higher when target CEOs are close to age 65.

To enhance the efficiency of government intervention, many researchers and policy makers call for governments to make use of information contained in stock market prices. However, price informativeness is endogenous to government policy. We analyze government policy in light of this endogeneity. In some cases, it is optimal for a government to commit to limit its reliance on market prices to avoid harming the aggregation of information into market prices.

A prominent theoretical literature argues that the threat of block sale (\u201cexit\u201d) can be an effective governance mechanism. Many blockholders are money managers. We show that, when money managers compete for investor capital, the threat of exit loses credibility, weakening its governance role.

The insurance industry provides a laboratory to explore these interactions: life insurers have greater flexibility than property and casualty insurers to hold speculative-grade assets at historical cost, and the degree to which life insurers recognize market values differs across U.S. states. During the financial crisis, insurers facing a lesser degree of market value recognition are less likely to sell downgraded asset-backed securities.

We report that funds under pressure engage more in SBOs. Pressured buyers pay higher multiples, use less leverage, and syndicate less suggesting that their motive is to spend equity. Pressured sellers exit at lower multiples and have shorter holding periods. When pressured counterparties meet, deal multiples depend on differential bargaining power.

We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997\u20132006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X14002098","research article","JFE","Finance","2","['defaults', 'incentives', 'lenders']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling and lender behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13002055","research article","JFE","Finance","2","['trust', 'investors', 'corporate earnings']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between trust and investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements, lacking a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

The empirical validation uses a data set of 624 global services sourcing initiatives obtained from the Offshoring Research Network, complemented with multiple external sources of cross-country data on cultural differences, languages, geographic distance and education levels.

States imposed more punitive terms on banks when political and legal institutions were more favorable and MNBs were unable to form a coalition.

As such, our study contributes new insights for understanding the nature and effects of distance, across different dimensions of distance and internationalization decisions. Moreover, internationalization theories have come to emphasize different theoretical rationales for explaining the influential role of distance on different decisions. By integrating these rationales together with the notion that distance-reducing commonalities and distance-augmenting differences have distinct implications for internationalization decisions, we introduce the notion that it is not only the addition of distance considerations that matters but also the directionality of such changes.

This implies that the imitation of others can initially serve as a presumably convenient low-risk shortcut to a planned or experience-driven internationalization process. Furthermore, our results confirm that this imitation process is channeled through formal network relations and that central network positions that are associated with superior information access, enhanced legitimacy, and status may promote deviating behavior.

The analysis, based on 5604 subsidiary observations of 423 MNEs from 1990 to 2012, confirms the positive synergic effect of aligning subsidiary strategy and human capital and shows the moderating effects of foreign exchange rate change and MNE international experience.

The observed changes in perceptions are also associated with changes in perceptions of risk and preferences for entry modes in a hypothetical business scenario.

Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness induced by a movie) find it more difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e.g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a meta-analysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50% more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.13.0026","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['consumer response', 'media context', 'emotions']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and advertising effectiveness without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical concerns.

Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding.

The authors present the first systematic set of studies exploring whether and how stated production mode (handmade vs. machine-made) affects product attractiveness. Four studies provide evidence for the existence of a positive handmade effect on product attractiveness. This effect is, to an important extent, driven by perceptions that handmade products symbolically \u201ccontain love.\u201d The authors validate this love account by controlling for alternative value drivers of handmade production (effort, product quality, uniqueness, authenticity, and pride). The handmade effect is moderated by two factors that affect the value of love. Specifically, consumers indicate stronger purchase intentions for handmade than machine-made products when buying gifts for their loved ones but not for more distant gift recipients, and they pay more for handmade gifts when purchased to convey love than simply to acquire the best-performing product.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.14.0018","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['handmade', 'love', 'authenticity']","The article discusses the emotional and symbolic value of handmade products, which touches on themes of authenticity and consumer connection.

The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues.

In response to these calls, the authors employ model specifications with varying identifying assumptions (i.e., rich data models, unobserved effects models, instrumental variable models, and panel internal instruments models) and use data from up to 155 publicly traded firms over a 12-year period (2000\u20132011) to find that firms can indeed expect to benefit financially from having a CMO at the strategy table. Specifically, their findings suggest that the performance (measured in terms of Tobin's q) of the sample firms that employ a CMO is, on average, approximately 15% greater than that of the sample firms that do not employ a CMO. This result is robust to the type of model specification used.

The 1,841 meta-analytic effect sizes show that a considerable body of marketing knowledge has been developed, as expressed by a meta-meta-analytic correlation of .24. This medium-sized effect is as strong or stronger than effects that have been found in compilations of meta-analyses in other, more basic fields of inquiry (e.g., psychology), which shows that marketing is a successful academic discipline. The effect sizes vary across subject areas, with pricing showing the strongest effects, followed by consumer behavior; methods and new product development show the weakest effects. This finding reveals different degrees of knowledge production and varying benchmarks to assess the contribution of future research outcomes in these subject areas. Marketing knowledge follows a discontinuous model of progress: knowledge has increased over time, but at a decreasing rate; the marketing field, which is currently characterized by fragmentation and specialization, has reached a stage of maturity.

First, analyzing a household panel data set, the authors demonstrate the real-world consequences of brand humanization on consumers' price sensitivity. Second, building on the theoretical premise that fairness judgments depend on consumer focus on the self versus others, they find that brand humanization enhances perceived unfairness of price increases for agency-oriented consumers, who tend to maximize their own self-interests. However, for communion-oriented consumers, who generally consider the needs of others, brand humanization increases perceived fairness of both price increases and decreases. Furthermore, because consumers' focus on the self versus others also depends on relationship goals, the nature of consumer\u2013brand relationships interacts with agency\u2013communion orientation to influence the effect of brand humanization on perceived price fairness. For example, exchange relationship norms reduce the power of brand anthropomorphization to enhance perceived fairness of price changes for communion-oriented consumers. In contrast, the communal nature of these relationships makes both agency- and communion-oriented consumers infer greater positive intent from a humanized (vs. nonhumanized) brand, thus leading to a more positive effect of brand humanization on price fairness for price decreases.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.13.0410","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['fairness', 'self', 'others', 'humanization', 'consumer']","The article discusses themes of perceived fairness in pricing, particularly how consumer orientation towards self versus others influences fairness judgments.

The former is linked to stimulus ideas, and the latter may be viewed as a first step toward problem decomposition. The authors propose that the effects of both stimulus ideas and problem decomposition are moderated by consumers' domain-specific knowledge. In particular, concrete cues such as stimulus ideas are more beneficial to low-knowledge consumers, and high-knowledge consumers are better served with abstract cues such as the ones offered by problem decomposition. The authors' hypotheses are supported by an extensive empirical investigation involving more than 6,000 participants. The findings suggest that online idea generation platforms should use problem decomposition more explicitly and that firms should not immediately show other participants' ideas to high-knowledge consumers when they access the platform.

The burden of making regular interest payments to debt holders pressures managers to generate adequate cash flows. The authors theorize that this may lead marketers to adopt short-term actions such as cutting advertising and research-and-development spending, which can hurt customer satisfaction by lowering perceived quality and perceived value. Furthermore, higher leverage reduces financial flexibility by constraining marketers from exploiting growth opportunities resulting from higher customer satisfaction.

Boosting ad spending before a recall announcement softens the stock price loss when the recall involves a newly introduced product with a minor hazard but sharpens the loss when the recalled product is an established model with a major hazard. Cutting prerecall advertising worsens the stock price loss when the recall involves a new product, regardless of the hazard. This research also reveals that in product-harm crisis management, profit maximization and shareholder value maximization can conflict with each other, underscoring the importance of developing an integrated crisis management strategy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.14.0273","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['crisis management', 'profit maximization', 'shareholder value']","The article discusses the conflict between profit maximization and shareholder value in the context of crisis management, suggesting a moderate awareness of ethical considerations.

However, some events contribute to incremental relationship development, as predicted by life cycle theories, whereas others spark \u201cturning points\u201d with dramatic impacts on the relationship. Such transformational relationship events are encounters between exchange partners that significantly disconfirm relational expectations (positively or negatively); they result in dramatic, discontinuous change to the relationship's trajectory and often reformulate the relationship itself. With a three-study, multimethod design, the authors (1) establish a foundation for differentiating dramatic and incremental exchange events on the basis of relational versus product expectations and disconfirmations, thus revealing that strong relationships benefit product disconfirmations but harm relational disconfirmations, and (2) conceptualize, define, and differentiate transformational relationship events from other types of disconfirming events and then link them to exchange performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.15.0105","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['exchange', 'relationships', 'transformational']","The article focuses primarily on the mechanics of business relationships and exchange events without significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Across six studies, the authors first outline an inference-based theory as to why the novelty-enhancing effect of kinetic property manifests: kinetic property generates impressions of how visually lively an ad is, which leads to inferences of product atypicality and, consequently, higher novelty judgments. Second, they demonstrate boundary conditions by showing that (1) the positive effect for kinetic property is evident with incremental (and not radical) innovations, (2) the effect dissipates when figure-ground contrast in the ad makes kinetic property less discriminable, (3) contextual adaptation to kinetic property can mitigate this effect, and (4) kinetic property enhances novelty judgments primarily when product category characteristics such as perceived market dynamism match with kinetic property\u2013based executions.

When buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are uncertain about seller costs, buyers\u2019 fairness perceptions and, thus, their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior. Consequently, buyers\u2019 fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies.

However, a crucial challenge is to retain the customers acquired with these free trials.

This article conceptualizes how marketing communication and usage behavior drive customers\u2019 retention decisions and develops hypotheses about the impact of free-trial acquisition on this process. To test the hypotheses, the authors model a customer's retention and usage decisions, distinguishing usage of a flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service.

The authors develop a mathematical model of redemption choice that unites three explanations for why customers seem to be motivated to stockpile on their own, even though the retailer does not reward them for doing so. These motivations are economic (the value of forgone points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological (customers value points differently than cash). The authors capture the psychological motivation by allowing customers to book cash and point transactions in separate mental accounts. They estimate the model on data from an international retailer using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and accurately forecast redemptions during an 11-month out-of-sample period.

The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers\u2019 self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers\u2019 private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathic managers\u2019 self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions.

Even when they do include this metric, increases in product return behavior are usually considered merely an economic cost that must be managed by decreasing the marketing resource allocations toward the customers making the returns. However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm\u2013customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months.

Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage.

The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness.

Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003\u20132005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.13.0260","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of media coverage and its effects on market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Specifically, the authors predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories.

These problems occur across service industries, ranging from severe Internet outages to major delays for airlines or trains. The literature has not yet addressed the following key question: How do service crises affect perceived service quality (PSQ) over time? To answer this question, the authors introduce a Double-Asymmetric Structural Vector Autoregressive model. It captures not only the short- and long-term effects of objective service performance on PSQ but also the differential effects of service crises versus service restoration. The authors analyze a unique data set from a major European railway company, spanning seven years of monthly observations. During this period, severe winter weather caused dramatic service crises. The authors find that performance losses loom larger than gains in the short run and also have permanent negative effects on PSQ in the long run. Consequently, a crisis followed by a restoration will result in a net negative long-term effect on PSQ.

In addition, sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors. Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors. Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be most affected by a ban.

Yet focal (own) location targeting may cannibalize profits on inframarginal sales. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of competitive locational targeting, the practice of promoting to consumers near a competitor's location. The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal, and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to generate incremental sales without cannibalizing profits.

However, there are few suitable approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model to quantify under- and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes within-person differences between answers obtained under direct questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408 respondents from a commercial web panel.

They show that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium. Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease consumer welfare or channel profits.

Such efforts can be guided by insight into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on customers\u2019 past purchase activity\u2014namely, the recency and frequency of past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver a customer's requested level of service.

A laboratory experiment tests this prediction and provides data for model calibration. Consistent with the idea of small victories, when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest). The calibrated model is consistent with the directional predictions of each theory. However, when participants are given choice over orderings, they choose the ascending ordering least often.

In this problem, one of the two available technologies can be installed on each edge and all customers of the network need to be served by at least the lower level (secondary) technology. The decision maker is confronted with uncertainty regarding the set of primary customers, i.e., the set of nodes that need to be served by the higher level (primary) technology. A set of discrete scenarios associated with the possible realizations of primary customers is available. The network is built in two stages. In the first stage the network topology must be determined. One may decide to install the primary technology on some of the edges in the first stage, or one can wait to see which scenario will be realized, in which case, edges with the installed secondary technology may be upgraded, if necessary to primary technology, but at higher recovery cost. The overall goal then is to build a \u201crecoverable robust\u201d spanning tree in the first stage that serves all customers by at least the lower level technology, and that minimizes the first-stage installation cost plus the worst-case cost needed to upgrade the edges of the selected tree, so that the primary customers of each scenario can be served using the primary technology.

Compared to other data protection mechanisms, auditing has the features of flexibility and maximum information. Auditing is typically accomplished by examining responses to past queries to determine whether a new query can be answered. It has been recognized that query denials release information and can cause data disclosure. This paper proposes an auditing mechanism that is free of query denial threat and applicable to mixed types of aggregate queries, including sum, max, min, deviation, etc. The core ideas are (i) deriving the complete information leakage from each query denial and (ii) carrying the complete leaked information derived from past answered and denied queries to audit each new query. The information leakage deriving problem can be formulated as a set of parametric optimization programs, and the whole auditing process can be modeled as a series of convex optimization problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0607","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical database auditing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are central to 'woke' themes."],["2015","27","1","Chun-An ChouChun-An Choucachou@binghamton.eduDepartment of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University, SUNY, Vestal, New York 13902Search for more papers by this author, Zhe LiangZhe Liangiseliangzhe@hotmail.comSchool of Economics and Management, Tongji University, Shanghai 20092, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author, Wanpracha Art ChaovalitwongseWanpracha Art Chaovalitwongseartchao@uw.eduDepartments of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195Search for more papers by this author, Tanya Y.

Because it is commonly impossible to determine familial relationships from field observations alone, the reconstruction of sibling relationships often depends on informative genetic markers coupled with accurate sibling reconstruction algorithms. Most studies in the literature reconstruct sibling relationships using methods that are based on either statistical analyses (i.e., likelihood estimation) or combinatorial concepts (i.e., Mendelian inheritance laws) of genetic data. We present a novel computational framework that integrates both combinatorial concepts and statistical analyses into one sibling reconstruction optimization model. To solve this integrated model, we propose a column-generation approach with a branch-and-price method. Under the assumption of parsimonious reconstruction, the master problem is to find the minimum set of sibling groups to cover the tested population. Pricing subproblems, which include both statistical similarity and combinatorial concepts of genetic data, are iteratively solved to generate high-quality sibling group candidates. Tested on real biological data sets, our approach efficiently provides reconstruction results that are more accurate than those provided by other state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0608","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for reconstructing sibling relationships in biological research without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2015","27","1","Masoud YaghiniMasoud Yaghiniyaghini@iust.ac.irDepartment of Rail Transportation Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, 16846-13114Search for more papers by this author, Mohammad KarimiMohammad Karimimohammad_karimi@rail.iust.ac.irDepartment of Rail Transportation Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, 16846-13114Search for more papers by this author, Mohadeseh RahbarMohadeseh Rahbarm_rahbar@rail.iust.ac.irDepartment of Rail Transportation Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, 16846-13114Search for more papers by this author, Mohammad Hassan SharifitabarMohammad Hassan Sharifitabarsharifitabar@rail.iust.ac.irDepartment of Rail Transportation Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, 16846-13114Search for more papers by this author","A Cutting-Plane Neighborhood Structure for Fixed-Charge Capacitated Multicommodity Network Design Problem","In this paper, a cutting-plane neighborhood structure is proposed for the fixed-charge capacitated multicommodity network design (CMND) problem.

Then a linear programming (LP) model is generated on the basis of the modified incumbent solution by relaxing binary variables and adding new constraints. The generated LP solution is improved using different cutting-plane inequalities. Subsequently, a new sub-mixed integer programming (MIP) model is created by fixing a number of variables in the generated LP solution. Then the local branching algorithm is used to solve the sub-MIP model and its solution is considered as a neighboring solution. A tabu search algorithm is used to evaluate the proposed neighborhood structure. To tune the parameters of the tabu search algorithm, we have used the design of experiments method. Standard problems with different sizes are employed to evaluate the proposed tabu search algorithm.

The algorithm seeks to obtain an improved continuous relaxation of the mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MILP/MINLP) model reformulation of the GDP while limiting the growth in the problem size. There are three main stages that form the basis of the algorithm. The first one is a presolve, consequence of the logic nature of GDP, which allows us to reduce the problem size, find good relaxation bounds, and identify properties that help us determine where to apply a basic step. The second stage is the iterative application of basic steps, selecting where to apply them and monitoring the improvement of the formulation. Finally, we use a hybrid reformulation of GDP that seeks to exploit both of the advantages attributed to the two common GDP-to-MILP/MINLP transformations, the Big-M, and the Hull reformulation. We illustrate the application of this algorithm with several examples. The results show the improvement in the problem formulations by generating models with improved relaxed solutions and relatively small growth of continuous variables and constraints. The algorithm generally leads to reduction in the solution times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0610","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithmic approach to optimize mathematical models without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Our new semidefinite programming relaxation of the min-cut problem is obtained by strengthening the known semidefinite programming relaxation for the quadratic assignment problem (or for the graph partition problem) by fixing two vertices in the graph; one on each side of the cut. Fixing results in several smaller subproblems that need to be solved to obtain the new bound. To efficiently solve these subproblems we exploit symmetry in the data; that is, both symmetry in the min-cut problem and symmetry in the graphs. To obtain upper bounds for the bandwidth of graphs with symmetry, we develop a heuristic approach based on the well-known reverse Cuthill\u2013McKee algorithm, and that improves significantly its performance on the tested graphs.

Such systems are widely used in transportation, utilities, healthcare, and manufacturing. Devices in the network are subject to traditional failures that can lead to a larger system failure if not repaired. However, the devices are also subject to security breaches that can also lead to catastrophic system failure. These security breaches could result from either cyber attacks (such as viruses, hackers, or terrorists) or physical tampering. We formulate a stochastic model of the system to examine the repair policies for both real and suspected failures. We develop a linear programming-based model for optimizing repair priorities. We show that, given the state of the system, the optimal repair policy follows a unique threshold indicator (either work on the real failures or the suspected ones). We examine the behavior of the optimal policy under different failure rates and threat levels. Finally, we examine the robustness of our model to violations in the underlying assumptions and find the model remains useful over a range of operating assumptions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0613","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of security and system reliability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Unlike the normal distribution, mixtures of normals can capture the kurtosis (fat tails) and nonzero skewness often necessary for accurately modeling a variety of real-world variables. An efficient analytical Monte Carlo method is proposed for considering multivariate mixtures of normal distributions having arbitrary covariance matrices. The method consists of a linear transformation of a multivariate normal having a computed covariance matrix into the desired multivariate mixture of normal distributions. The computed covariance matrix is derived analytically. Among the properties of the multivariate mixture of normals that we demonstrate is that any linear combination of mixtures of normal distributions is also a mixture of normal distributions. Methods of fitting mixtures of normal distributions are briefly discussed. A motivating example carried throughout this paper is the use of multivariate mixtures of normals for modeling daily changes in market variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0616","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical modeling without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

As the cost of a regenerator is high, we wish to deploy as few regenerators as possible in the network, while ensuring all nodes can communicate with each other. In this paper we introduce the generalized regenerator location problem (GRLP) in which we are given a set S of nodes that corresponds to candidate locations for regenerators, and a set T of nodes that must communicate with each other. If S = T = N, we obtain the regenerator location problem (RLP), which we have studied previously and shown to be NP-complete. Our solution procedure to the RLP is based on its equivalence to the maximum leaf spanning tree problem (MLSTP). Unfortunately, this equivalence does not apply to the GRLP, nor do the procedures developed previously for the RLP. To solve the GRLP, we propose reduction procedures, two construction heuristics, and a local search procedure that we collectively refer to as a heuristic framework. We also establish a correspondence between the (node-weighted) directed Steiner forest problem and the GRLP. Using this fact, we provide several ways to derive natural and extended integer programming (IP) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) models for the GRLP and compare the strength of these models. Using the strongest model derived on the natural node selection variables we develop a branch-and-cut approach to solve the problem to optimality. The results indicate that the exact approach can easily solve instances with up to 200 nodes to optimality, whereas the heuristic framework is a high-quality approach for solving large-scale instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0621","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical problem related to optical networks and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We characterize these two requirements as chance constraints, which are typically used for bounding the risk of undesirable random outcomes. Given independently distributed edge weights, we reformulate BCSBSTP as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, approximated by two mixed-integer linear programs based on special ordered set of type one (SOS1) and special ordered set of type two (SOS2) variables. By relaxing the probabilistic guarantee on the minimum edge weight in BCSBSTP, we also consider a stochastic bottleneck spanning tree problem (SBSTP), of which optimal tree solutions are approximated via a bisection algorithm in pseudopolynomial time.

In the second variant, we jointly determine the set of offered products and their corresponding prices. In both variants, the price of each product has to be chosen within given upper and lower bounds specific to the product, each customer chooses among the offered products according to the nested logit model, and the objective is to maximize the expected revenue from each customer. We give approximation methods for both variants. For any \u03c1 > 0, our approximation methods obtain a solution with an expected revenue deviating from the optimal expected revenue by no more than a factor of 1 + \u03c1. To obtain such a solution, our approximation methods solve a linear program whose size grows at rate 1/\u03c1. In addition to our approximation methods, we develop a linear program that we can use to obtain an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue.

Optimization algorithms for such problems need to evaluate the expected future costs of current decisions, often referred to as the recourse function. In practice, this calculation is computationally difficult as it requires the evaluation of a multidimensional integral whose integrand is an optimization problem. In turn, the recourse function has to be estimated using techniques such as scenario trees or Monte Carlo methods, both of which require numerous functional evaluations to produce accurate results for large-scale problems with multiple periods and high-dimensional uncertainty. In this work, we introduce an importance sampling framework for stochastic programming that can produce accurate estimates of the recourse function using a small number of samples. Our framework combines Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with kernel density estimation algorithms to build a nonparametric importance sampling distribution, which can then be used to produce a lower-variance estimate of the recourse function. We demonstrate the increased accuracy and efficiency of our approach using variants of well-known multistage stochastic programming problems. Our numerical results show that our framework produces more accurate estimates of the optimal value of stochastic programming models, especially for problems with moderate variance, multimodal, or rare-event distributions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0630","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic programming and optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, if the table contains text, minimizing the height of the table for a given maximum width is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem because of the need to find the right choice of height/width configuration for each cell in the table. We investigate the modelling decisions involved in formulating this problem for use with standard combinatorial optimization techniques that are guaranteed to find the minimal-height table. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. We provide a detailed empirical evaluation of the resulting models using mixed integer programming and constraint programming with lazy clause generation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0637","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to table layout in word processing and online applications, with no mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2015","27","3","Debabrata DeyDebabrata Deyddey@uw.eduFoster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195Search for more papers by this author, Atanu LahiriAtanu Lahiriatanu.lahiri@utdallas.eduJindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080Search for more papers by this author, Guoying ZhangGuoying Zhanggrace.zhang@mwsu.eduDillard College of Business, Midwestern State University, Wichita Falls, Texas 76308Search for more papers by this author","Optimal Policies for Security Patch Management","Effective patch management is critical to ensure the security of information systems that modern organizations count on today. Facing numerous patch releases from vendors, an information technology (IT) manager must weigh the costs of frequent patching against the security risks that can arise from delays in patch application. To this end, we develop a rigorous quantitative framework to analyze and compare several patching policies that are of practical interest. Our analyses of pure policies\u2014policies that rely on a single metric such as elapsed time or patch severity level\u2014show that certain policies are never optimal and no single policy may fit all information systems uniformly well. Depending on the context parameters, particularly the setup and business disruption costs for patching, either a time-based approach or an approach based on the cumulative severity level may be effective. To develop a more complete guideline for policy selection, we decipher hybrid policies that combine multiple metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to verify the robustness of our analytical results. Overall, our paper establishes a comprehensive framework for analyzing various patching policies and furnishes useful insights for IT managers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0638","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of security patch management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Energy arbitrage, the process of buying, storing, and selling electricity to exploit variations in electricity spot prices, is becoming an important way of paying for expensive investments into grid-level storage. Independent system operators such as the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) require that battery storage operators place bids into an hour-ahead market (although settlements may occur in increments as small as five minutes, which is considered near \u201creal-time\u201d). The operator has to place these bids without knowing the energy level in the battery at the beginning of the hour and simultaneously accounting for the value of leftover energy at the end of the hour. The problem is formulated as a dynamic program. We describe and employ a convergent approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that exploits monotonicity of the value function to find a revenue-generating bidding policy; using optimal benchmarks, we empirically show the computational benefits of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a distribution-free variant of the ADP algorithm that does not require any knowledge of the distribution of the price process (and makes no assumptions regarding a specific real-time price model). We demonstrate that a policy trained on historical real-time price data from the NYISO using this distribution-free approach is indeed effective.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0640","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of electricity market bidding and battery storage without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Applying our algorithm to several numerical examples, we generate new insights regarding the control and optimization of these systems. We consider a continuous time model, seeking base-stock levels for components that minimize the sum of holding costs and product-specific backorder costs. Our initial focus is on first-come, first-served (FCFS) allocation of components to products; for this setting our algorithm quickly computes solutions for which the asymptotic optimality gap with the optimal FCFS base-stock policy is less than 1%. We then turn to two related questions: How do common heuristics used in practice compare to our performance, and how costly is the FCFS assumption? For the first question, we investigate the effectiveness of ignoring simultaneous stock-outs (ISS), a heuristic that has been used by companies such as IBM and Dell. Our experiments indicate that ISS performance, when compared to the optimal FCFS base-stock policy, improves as the average newsvendor (NV) fractiles increase but suffers under lead-time demand correlations. For the second question, we develop an efficiently computable upper bound on the benefit of optimal allocation over FCFS. We find that for many large ATO systems, FCFS performs surprisingly well and that its performance improves with decreasing NV fractile asymmetry among products and, again, with increasing average NV fractiles. We also investigate simple no-holdback allocation policies and find that they tend to outperform the best FCFS policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0641","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory control and optimization in assemble-to-order systems without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We assume that the two systems are designed to operate independently, but want to help each other respond to unexpected overloads. The proposed overload control automatically activates sharing (sending some customers from one system to the other) once a ratio of the queue lengths in the two systems crosses an activation threshold (with ratio and activation threshold parameters for each direction). In this paper, we are primarily concerned with ensuring that the system recovers rapidly after the overload is over, either because (i) the two systems return to normal loading or (ii) the direction of the overload suddenly shifts in the opposite direction. To achieve rapid recovery, we introduce lower thresholds for the queue ratios, below which one-way sharing is released. As a basis for studying the complex dynamics, we develop a new six-dimensional fluid approximation for a system with time-varying arrival rates, extending a previous fluid approximation involving a stochastic averaging principle. We conduct simulations to confirm that the new algorithm is effective for predicting the system performance and choosing effective control parameters. The simulation and the algorithm show that the system can experience an inefficient nearly periodic behavior, corresponding to an oscillating equilibrium (congestion collapse) if the sharing is strongly inefficient and the control parameters are set inappropriately.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0642","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of overload control in service systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The existing context-free mapping approach between tags and concepts fails to address the problems of social synonymy and social polysemy when ontologies are induced from folksonomies. The novel contributions of this paper are threefold. First, grounded in the cognitively motivated category utility measure, a novel basic-level concept mining algorithm is developed to construct semantically rich concept vectors to alleviate the problem of social synonymy. Second, contextual aspects of ontology learning are exploited via probabilistic topic modeling to address the problem of social polysemy. Third, a novel context-sensitive domain ontology learning algorithm that combines link- and content-based semantic analysis is developed to identify both taxonomic and associative relations among concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful research that exploits a cognitively motivated method to learn context-sensitive domain ontologies from folksonomies. By using the Open Directory Project ontology as a benchmark, we examined the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms based on social annotations crawled from three different folksonomy sites. Our experimental results show that the proposed ontology learning system significantly outperforms the best baseline system by 13.83% in terms of taxonomic F-measure. The practical implication of our research is that high-quality ontologies are constructed with minimal human intervention to facilitate concept-driven retrieval of linked data and the knowledge-based interoperability among enterprises.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0644","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of ontology learning and semantic analysis without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We first apply the proposed method to a queueing problem and then study a more practical application based on an advance multipriority patient scheduling problem. We investigate the quality and practical implications of the resulting appointment scheduling policies using simulation, and compare their performance to that of four other policies. Patient scheduling policies obtained by the new method not only depend on the number of appointments already booked on each day but also on the overall system workload. In particular, these policies provide lower discounted cost values and shorter average wait times for higher priority patients than policies directly obtained using linear programming and an affine value function approximation in the predecision state variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0645","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for dynamic programming and patient scheduling without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Well-known pricing and promotion strategies for differentiated products do not translate well to such products where price is closely tied to the cost of the products. Consequently, firms with multiple stores of commodity products are faced with the problem of product assortment that incorporates varying geographic and demographic conditions of locations they serve. The paper presents a model for assortment planning and optimization for multiple stores of a company. The novelty of our approach is twofold: first, it deploys data mining techniques to identify sales pattern information across multiple stores through existing sales data across segments and across stores; second, it identifies the optimal product assortment for each store and permits analyses of assortment efficiency evaluation among all existing stores. Our model first finds frequent itemsets based on association rule analysis and prunes them using a novel conflict resolution method. It then incorporates the identified product combinations into the development of the optimization formulation. Our methodology offers solutions that have important implications on product assortment, including complements versus substitutes and product bundling, and sheds lights on product planning and assortment strategies in general.

Hence, reducing these roundoff errors or eliminating them altogether is imperative to guarantee the correctness of the solutions provided by optimization solvers. To achieve this goal without having to use rational arithmetic, we introduce two roundoff-error-free factorizations that require storing the same number of individual elements and performing a similar number of operations as the traditional LU and Cholesky factorizations.

This study examines the value of upstream planning within hospital-wide resource allocation decisions based on machine learning (ML) and mixed-integer programming (MIP), focusing on prediction of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and the use of these predictions for allocating scarce hospital resources. DRGs are a payment scheme employed at patients\u2019 discharge, where the DRG and length of stay determine the revenue that the hospital obtains. We show that early and accurate DRG classification using ML methods, incorporated into an MIP-based resource allocation model, can increase the hospital\u2019s contribution margin, the number of admitted patients, and the utilization of resources such as operating rooms and beds. We test these methods on hospital data containing more than 16,000 inpatient records and demonstrate improved DRG classification accuracy as compared to the hospital\u2019s current approach. The largest improvements were observed at and before admission, when information such as procedures and diagnoses is typically incomplete, but performance was improved even after a substantial portion of the patient\u2019s length of stay, and under multiple scenarios making different assumptions about the available information. Using the improved DRG predictions within our resource allocation model improves contribution margin by 2.9% and the utilization of scarce resources such as operating rooms and beds from 66.3% to 67.3% and from 70.7% to 71.7%, respectively. This enables 9.0% more nonurgent elective patients to be admitted as compared to the baseline.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0655","","JOC","Information Systems","2","['resource allocation', 'healthcare', 'machine learning']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and efficiency in healthcare using machine learning, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our approach relies on the identification of compatible variables that ensure a nondegenerate iteration if pivoted into the basis. The problem of finding a strict improvement in the objective function is proved to be equivalent to two smaller problems, respectively, focusing on compatible and incompatible variables. We then show that the improved primal simplex (IPS) is a particular implementation of this generic theoretical framework. The resulting new description of IPS naturally emphasizes what should be considered as necessary adaptations of the framework versus specific implementation choices. This provides original insight into IPS that allows for the identification of weaknesses and potential alternative choices that would extend the efficiency of the method to a wider set of problems. We perform experimental tests on an extended collection of data sets including instances of Mittelmann\u2019s benchmark for linear programming. The results confirm the excellent potential of IPS and highlight some of its limits while showing a path toward an improved implementation of the generic algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0656","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical algorithmic framework without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

We discuss properties of the model and an implementation of the progressive hedging algorithm to find near-optimal surgery schedules. We conduct numerical experiments using data from a large hospital to identify managerial insights related to surgery planning and the avoidance of surgery cancellations. We compare the progressive hedging algorithm to an easy-to-implement heuristic for practical problem instances to estimate the value of the stochastic solution.

We are primarily motivated by accelerated tumor repopulation toward the end of radiation treatment, which is believed to play a role in treatment failure for some tumor sites. A dynamic programming framework is developed to determine an optimal fractionation scheme based on a model of cell kill from radiation and tumor growth in between treatment days. We find that faster tumor growth suggests shorter overall treatment duration. In addition, the presence of accelerated repopulation suggests larger dose fractions later in the treatment to compensate for the increased tumor proliferation. We prove that the optimal dose fractions are increasing over time.

To address this question, we examine the theoretical underpinnings of collaboration structures in multi-partner R&D projects\u2014i.e., the scale and the scope of partnering efforts. Partnering scale captures the extent of resource interdependencies between a firm and its partners; partnering scope captures both the breadth and depth of the interdependencies between a firm and its partners. Using primary data from 147 multi-partner R&D projects, we develop and test hypotheses that examine the impact of partnering scale and scope decisions on partnering performance. Results indicate that partnering scale has a curvilinear relationship with partnering performance. That is, intermediate levels of partnering scale are associated with higher partnering performance, compared to low or high levels of partnering scale. However, we also find that the nature of this relationship is moderated by the sub-dimensions of partnering scope. Specifically, increase in partnering breadth appears to magnify the negative effect of partnering scale on performance. In contrast, increase in partnering depth appears to overcome this negative effect, allowing firms to operate at higher levels of partnering scale. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to designing collaboration structures for multi-partner R&D projects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.008","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['collaboration', 'partners', 'performance']","The article focuses on technical aspects of collaboration in R&D projects without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We articulate the behavioral and mechanistic effects of team autonomy by integrating operations management and behavioral literatures. Further, we view team autonomy as a bipolar factor and argue that both the behavioral and mechanistic effects of team autonomy on operational outcomes are non-linear. Drawing on information processing theory, we propose that the benefits of team autonomy depend on the degree of technological turbulence. A study of 212 new product development projects supports these propositions. Specifically, the relationship between team autonomy and operational outcomes is \u2229-shaped in technologically turbulent environments and U-shaped in technologically stable environments.

However, the literature still lacks a clear conceptualization of a network-level understanding of supply disruptions. Not having a network level understanding of supply disruptions prevents firms from fully mitigating the negative effects of a supply disruption. Graph theory helps to conceptualize a supply network and differentiate between disruptions at the node/arc level vs. network level. The structure of a supply network consists of a collection of nodes (facilities) and the connecting arcs (transportation). From this perspective, small events that disrupt a node or arc in the network can have major consequences for the network. A failure in a node or arc can potentially stop the flow of material across network. This study conceptualizes supply network disruption and resilience by examining the structural relationships among entities in the network. We compare four fundamental supply network structures to help understand supply network disruption and resilience. The analysis shows that node/arc-level disruptions do not necessarily lead to network-level disruptions, and demonstrates the importance of differentiating a node/arc disruption vs. a network disruption. The results also indicate that network structure significantly determines the likelihood of disruption. In general, different structural relationships among network entities have different levels of resilience. More specifically, resilience improves when the structural relationships in a network follow the power-law. This paper not only offers a new perspective of supply network disruption, but also suggests a useful analytical approach to assessing supply network structures for resilience.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply network disruptions and resilience without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because of its association with customer effectiveness, some researchers have considered agility to be fundamentally different from lean, which has been linked to cost efficiency (Goldsby et al., 2006). Therefore, the relationship between agility and cost efficiency is not clear due to limited empirical scrutiny from researchers. Since elimination of waste is the cornerstone of lean, unraveling the relationship between agility and efficiency can also offer a better perspective on relationship between the fundamental paradigms of agility and lean. The manuscript makes a key contribution to the agility literature by examining the association between supply chain agility (FSCA), cost efficiency and customer effectiveness across various environmental situations. We use archival data to examine the moderating effects of environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity. It has been argued that firms should embrace agile strategies when operating in highly uncertain environments, and embrace lean strategies when operating in more stable environments (Lee, 2002; Sebastiao and Golicic, 2008). We empirically question this premise to determine whether supply chain agility can also lead to superior performance for firms operating in stable environments. The study results also provide a better understanding of how FSCA contributes to firm financial performance. We evaluate the impact of FSCA on the firm's Return on Assets using archival data from the Compustat database.

In doing so, we operationalize firm resilience to understand how supply chain disruption orientated firms can develop resilience to supply chain disruptions. We find that supply chain disruption orientation alone is not enough for a firm to develop resilience. Supply chain disruption oriented firms require the ability to reconfigure resources or have a risk management resource infrastructure to develop resilience. The way in which supply chain disruption oriented firms develop resilience through resource reconfiguration or risk management infrastructure depends on the context of the disruption as high impact or low impact. In a high impact disruption context, resource reconfiguration fully mediates the relationship between supply chain disruption orientation and firm resilience. In a low impact disruption context, supply chain disruption orientation and risk management infrastructure have a synergistic effect on developing firm resilience.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.002","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['resilience', 'supply chain', 'risk management']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain resilience and risk management without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Drawing upon information processing theory and quality management concepts, we examine HIT infrastructure simultaneously with two distinct means of processing information: (1) operational use of error data for detecting and reducing hospital errors, and (2) strategic use of objective data for organizational planning. We use time-sequenced data to examine HIT infrastructure (secondary data in 2008), information processing mechanisms (primary survey data from 258 hospitals in 2009), and two measures of hospital performance: (1) care quality, and (2) patient satisfaction (secondary data in 2010). Using hierarchical regression analysis we find that whether and how investments in HIT infrastructure are complemented by information processing mechanisms depends upon the performance measure under consideration and the form of information processing employed. Specifically, operational error processing complements HIT infrastructure in its association with higher care quality but not with patient satisfaction. In comparison, higher levels of strategic information processing complement HIT infrastructure in its association with higher patient satisfaction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.003","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['patient safety', 'medical errors', 'care quality']","The article discusses healthcare information technologies with a focus on patient safety and care quality, which indicates a concern for ethical outcomes in healthcare.

While some studies have concluded that collaboration leads to beneficial effects, others have questioned the positive effects of collaboration on relationship performance. Drawing on contingency theory and transaction cost economics (TCE), we seek to better understand the linkage among collaboration, trust and agility performance in a buyer\u2013supplier relationship. Further, we study the contingent influence of requirements certainty and supplier asset specificity, two key TCE constructs in buyer\u2013supplier relationships, on the collaboration\u2013agility performance relationship. We show that while trust mediates the impact of collaboration on agility performance, the indirect effect of collaboration on agility performance via trust is significant only beyond a threshold level of collaboration. The theoretical implication of this result is that the performance relationship is non-linear, a result that has not been recognized in current literature. The practical implication is that organizations need to establish a certain level of collaboration before its positive impact can be realized. In addition, we show that the impact of collaboration on agility performance in buyer\u2013supplier sourcing relationships can be positive, negative or neutral depending on the levels of trust, supplier asset specificity and requirements certainty, emphasizing the need to develop contingency theories.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.11.004","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['collaboration', 'trust', 'performance']","The article discusses collaboration and trust in buyer-supplier relationships, which touches on relational dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

One of the most salient risks for buyer firms in service triads is service failure due to the service provider. Indeed such service failures may be more costly for firms due to the greater relational and operational costs that may arise from the presence of the third-party provider. Yet, neither the services literature nor extant operations literature on service triads has paid much attention to the financial consequences to the buyer firm \u2013 i.e., service risks \u2013 of such service failures in triads. To fill this gap, we investigate the financial penalty of service failures due to the service provider using the event study methodology and a sample of 146 customer information security breaches as our empirical context. Analysis of the abnormal returns reveals that service failures due to the front-end service provider lead to greater shareholder losses than such failures due to the buyer firm. This provides important new insight into the financial risks arising from outsourcing front-end services. Further, we investigate the ability of the buyer firm's employee and financial resources to temper these shareholder losses. We find that buyer firm employee productivity can moderate the greater financial penalty associated with such triadic service failures but that buyer firm leverage tends to not have such a mitigating effect. This provides new guidance for theory and practice regarding how buyer firms can position themselves to buffer the financial risks arising from service failures due to front-end service providers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['service failures', 'information security', 'financial risks']","The article primarily focuses on the financial implications of service failures and does not emphasize social justice or ethical considerations.

This creates a triadic setting in which an outsourcing provider serves end customers on behalf of its clients. While outsourcing presents an opportunity to serve customers, service providers differ in their motivation and ability to fulfill customer needs. Prior research suggests that firms with a strong customer focus have an intrinsic motivation to address customer needs. We suggest that in an outsourcing context, this intrinsic motivation does not suffice. Using a Motivation\u2013Opportunity\u2013Ability framework, we posit that the effect of a provider's customer focus will be moderated by a set of relational, firm, and customer characteristics that affect its ability to serve end customers. We test our conceptualization among 171 outsourcing clients from the Netherlands and then validate these results among 135 Indian outsourcing providers. The findings reveal that customer-focused providers achieve higher levels of customer need fulfillment but this effect is contingent on their ability to serve end customers. In particular, customer-focused providers more effectively fulfill customer needs when clients and providers share close relational ties, when clients also have a high level of customer focus, and when end customer needs exhibit a low degree of turbulence. In addition, we find that, in turbulent markets, equipment-related services offer greater opportunity for effective customer need fulfillment than other outsourced services.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['customer focus', 'customer needs', 'outsourcing']","The article primarily discusses outsourcing and customer service without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In this triad, franchisees use their affiliation with the franchisor's brand to attract customers to their local outlets. In exchange for the right of assuming the identity of the brand, the franchisee pays the franchisor royalties and retains residual profits. Applying Agency Theory, this paper examines the inherent conflict of interests between a principal (i.e., franchisor) that controls and manages brand equity as a shared resource and an agent (i.e., franchisee) that retains pricing right and profits from the identity of the brand by interacting directly with customers. We empirically isolate the effect of triad structure on outlet performance by matching two unique datasets. One set of data captures operational performance in the form of aggregated online review scores and the other financial performance including average daily hotel rate and revenue per available room. We find that franchisees charge higher prices than their corporate counterparts even when controlling for operational performance. Even though franchisees charge higher prices they maintain similar financial performance in terms of revenue per available room. These results suggest that the triad structure plays a significant role in franchisees\u2019 ability to free-ride on shared brand equity and have important managerial implications for effective outsourcing, contract design and performance evaluation for a wide range of service industries.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.10.005","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on operational and financial performance within franchise triads without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Critics say that even if ERP systems may be beneficial for organizations operating in stable conditions, they are surely detrimental to organizations that face dynamic market requirements. This is because ERP systems are said to impose such procedures and constraints on organizations that make business processes inflexible to change. In contrast, proponents argue that the information-processing capabilities of ERP systems are crucial for organizations that face dynamic market requirements and also that the criticized procedures and constraints actually support process reengineering. These two contradictory arguments are often found in practitioner literature, but both of them can also be supported by management theory. The central tenets of the Organic Theory of organization design imply that ERP systems should be detrimental when market requirements change frequently, whereas the principles of Rigid Flexibility Theory suggest that they should be advantageous. In this study, we use cross-sectional data from 151 manufacturing plants to determine which argument is more applicable in the context of manufacturing planning and control.

At this point, a sufficient body of empirical SCM research has been put forward to allow for quantitative assessment of the field. Therefore, we examine three key elements of study design to assess what has happened, what is currently happening, and where we should be heading as a field. To do so, following a pattern of reviews in similar disciplines, we begin with an examination of effect sizes of the relationships under investigation. Results show that effect sizes in SCM research have marginally increased over time and that sub-domains within SCM that receive the most scholarly attention also have higher effect sizes. We also conduct a post hoc analysis of statistical power and empirically examine a range of factors and study contexts that could influence power. Findings suggest that average statistical power in SCM research exceeds the statistical power of most related disciplines and is particularly high in several unique contexts. Lastly, we find that measurement reliability and the use of control variables have increased over time, possibly suggesting the field has matured, instilling a degree of confidence in its research. Overall, our results show that SCM research is becoming more empirically rigorous, but we also uncover key areas that warrant improvement. We describe implications of our review for the design of future SCM empirical studies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.001","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management research and statistical analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2015","36","1","Jesse Bockstedt,\u00a0\n                     Jesse Bockstedt\n                     \n                        bockstedt@arizona.edu\n                     \n                     Eller College of Management, University of Arizona, United StatesSearch for more papers by this authorCheryl Druehl,\u00a0\n                     Cheryl Druehl\n                     \n                        cdruehl@gmu.edu\n                     \n                     School of Business, George Mason University, United StatesSearch for more papers by this authorAnant Mishra,\u00a0\n                     Anant Mishra\n                     \n                        amishra6@gmu.edu\n                     \n                     School of Business, George Mason University, United StatesSearch for more papers by this author","Problem-solving effort and success in innovation contests: The role of national wealth and national culture","Innovation contests allow firms to harness specialized skills and services from globally dispersed participants for solutions to business problems. Such contests provide a rich setting for operations management (OM) scholars to explore problem solving in global labor markets as firms continue to unbundle their innovation value chains. In this study, we examine the implications of specific types of diversity in innovation contests on problem-solving effort and success. First, we conceptualize diversity among contestants in terms of national wealth (measured as gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) adjusted for purchasing power parity) and national culture (measured using the culture dimensions of performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance) and examine how such factors influence problem-solving effort. Next, we examine how differences between contestants and contest holders in terms of the above factors influence contest outcomes. Using data from a popular online innovation contest platform and country-level archival data, we find that contestants from countries with lower levels of GDPP are more likely to exert greater problem-solving effort compared to other contestants. With regard to national culture, we find that performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance have positive and negative effects, respectively, each of which weakens with increasing levels of GDPP. Finally, our analysis provides evidence of homophily effects indicating that contestants who share greater similarities with the contest holder in terms of national wealth and national culture are more likely to be successful in a contest. We discuss the implications of the study's findings for contest holders and platform owners who organize innovation contests, and for emerging research on innovation contests.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.002","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['diversity', 'national culture', 'national wealth']","The article discusses the implications of diversity in terms of national wealth and culture on problem-solving efforts in innovation contests, indicating a moderate focus on social factors.

However, coordination is difficult because healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i.e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations context \u2013 use of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i.e. electronic health records systems) by physicians and hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employment \u2013 influence information exchange and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to information exchange relationship, and information exchange relationship to provider\u2013patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the USA, we find that increased information exchange relationship drives provider\u2013patient communication, and increased social interaction ties drives information exchange relationship. Social interaction ties fully mediates the relationship between ITDR and information exchange relationship. Physician employment amplifies the link between ITDR and social interaction ties, but does not have an effect on the link between ITDR and information exchange.

This is a relevant question, because firms seek stability in their operations, and therefore managers need to know how the structure of their supply chains affects the occurrence of disruptions. The present study addresses this issue with a specific focus on upstream supply chain (supply-side) disruptions. Drawing on the literature on supply chain complexity, we devise and test a model that predicts the frequency of supply chain disruptions based on a multi-dimensional conceptualization of upstream supply chain complexity. Not only do the empirical findings suggest that all of the three investigated complexity drivers \u2013 horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity \u2013 increase the frequency of disruptions, but also that they interact and amplify each other's effects in a synergistic fashion.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2014.12.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, when the cost-driven practices of many suppliers in these chains come to light there is often considerable debate over the ethics of these practices. This research uses the well-known Hunt\u2013Vitell framework as the theoretical foundation for a structural equation model of the deontological and teleological evaluations used by consumers when making ethical judgments of a firm's controversial cost-driven global sourcing practices. Data from a large-scale U.S. consumer survey show the importance of deontological and teleological evaluations in forming consumers\u2019 ethical judgments of global sourcing practices, and establish a strong relationship between ethical judgment and the intention of consumers to alter consumption of a firm's products. Extensions to the framework and demographic analyses for age, gender, and income provide insights as to how perceptions of these practices affect consumer evaluations of a company involved in global sourcing and how consumers actualize their resultant intentions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.01.001","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['ethical judgments', 'global sourcing', 'cost-driven practices', 'consumer intentions', 'deontological']","The article discusses ethical judgments related to global sourcing practices, highlighting consumer concerns about ethics and the implications of cost-driven practices.

This research examines the operating performance effects of early versus late adoption of Six Sigma process improvement. Using theories of organizational learning and knowledge transfer, we develop hypotheses describing the advantages of late adoption, and factors that affect a firm's ability to benefit from Six Sigma either as an early or late adopter. We test our hypotheses using an event study methodology. The empirical results show that, on average, late adopters in our sample enjoy significantly greater performance gains than early adopters. However, the analysis also shows that the advantages of late adopters tend to be moderated by certain environmental and structural characteristics of a firm. Specifically, late adoption has been favorable when firms operate in low-velocity industries, when they primarily sell in business-to-business markets, when they have good financial performance prior to adoption, and when they are large. Conversely, when adopters operate in conditions that have the opposite characteristics, then early adoption appears to have produced better results. Understanding the effects of these factors can enhance managers\u2019 abilities to determine appropriate adoption timing to increase performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.01.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Six Sigma adoption and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a field experiment on new product forecasts in the music industry, our analysis reveals that when forecasters are concerned with predictive accuracy and only managerial judgments are employed, providing both types of decision support data is beneficial. However, if judgmental forecasts are combined with a statistical forecast, restricting the decision support provided to human judges to contextual anchors is beneficial. We identify two novel interactions demonstrating that the exploitation of nonlinearities is easiest for human judgment if contextual data are present but historical data are absent. Thus, if the role of human judgment is to detect these nonlinearities (and the linearities are taken care of by some statistical model with which judgments are combined), then a restriction of the decision support provided makes sense.

Some view improving safety as separate and distinct from increasing operational effectiveness; they are contradictory requirements. Others emphasize that safety and effectiveness are complementary, and combine to enhance competitiveness. Recent research proposes that this confusion can be explained by examining the operational and safety routines used in production. Specifically, when an organization chooses to manage safety and operations in a coordinated fashion using a joint management system, safety and operational effectiveness are complementary. Yet, the contradiction between safety and operations can occur when the functions are managed as separate and unequal silos. This research tests this supposition using the theory of relational coordination. The results, based on a combination of survey and archival safety data from 198 manufacturing firms, show that safety and operational outcomes are indirectly related via routines and that plants that manage safety and operations using a joint management system make these priorities complementary and do not create trade-offs between safety and operational performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.002","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['safety', 'operational effectiveness', 'relational coordination']","The article discusses safety and operational effectiveness in production systems, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects and management practices rather than social justice or equity themes.

Anecdotal evidence further suggests that this decline in profitability arises from a decline in operational performance. However, the results of our study, which empirically examines the bullwhip effect across supply chain partners through an analysis of 383 actual customer base-supplier dyads, challenge this commonly held position by suggesting that while traditional bullwhip often yields reduced ROA, it ultimately has no relationship with the firm's operating margin. Additionally, our results also call into question whether or not production coordination between customers and suppliers can minimize the need for inventory and capacity buffers, which are the two commonly utilized methods for battling the bullwhip effect. Thus the relationship between bullwhip and firm performance is far more nuanced and complicated than previously believed. We also show how the managerial bullwhip levers of coordinating production across supply chain partners, or deploying inventory and capacity buffer control mechanisms, can help maximize a firm's performance along different dimensions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of supply chain performance and the bullwhip effect, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In doing so, we identify two related but distinct problem-solving orientations among senior executives. The first orientation uses short-term remedies to control and contain the impact of a problem, which we label as symptomatic problem solving (SPS). The other orientation addresses a problem situation with the objective of developing new understanding and skills, and we label it as generative problem solving (GPS). We test our theoretical framework using two waves of survey data from a sample of metal casting manufacturers (metal foundries) in the United States. Our analysis shows that GPS positively affects both internal and external knowledge stocks, while SPS negatively influences internal knowledge stock. Knowledge stocks, in turn, facilitate incremental and radical manufacturing improvements. Our results suggest that the two executive problem-solving orientations can potentially counteract each other in enhancing and depreciating knowledge stocks, and subsequently affect a manufacturer's ability to attain improvements both in the short and long terms","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of executive problem solving and knowledge accumulation in manufacturing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring very low on the 'woke' scale."],["2015","36","1","Yongrui Duan,\u00a0\n                     Yongrui Duan\n                     School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, ChinaSearch for more papers by this authorYuliang Yao,\u00a0\n                     Yuliang Yao\n                     \n                        yuy3@lehigh.edu\n                     \n                     College of Business and Economics, Lehigh University, United StatesSearch for more papers by this authorJiazhen Huo,\u00a0\n                     Jiazhen Huo\n                     School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author","Bullwhip effect under substitute products","Using a large-scale, product-level dataset collected from a supply chain dyad, we examine the effect of own and substitute products on a focal product's bullwhip effect and estimate the existence and magnitude of the bullwhip effect at the product level. We find that, under substitute products, the bullwhip effect is not only affected by a product's own factors but also by those of its substitute products. An increase in the number of own price changes is associated with a decrease in the bullwhip effect in terms of the direct effect but with an increase in the bullwhip effect in terms of the total effect, and increases in the number of price changes of substitute products and own stockouts are associated with increases in the bullwhip effect. The potential effects for own price changes, price changes of substitute products and own stockouts are as much as 59.51%, 95.06% and 66.11%.

Successful projects, such as information systems projects, enable organizations to develop a superior supply network and enhance the capability of operations management. A few studies have investigated the effects of control on project performance; however, complexity risk has not been integrated into the relationship between control and performance. Limited evidence has been provided concerning whether modes of control differ in their effectiveness in the presence of a single risk factor. Based on quantitative data obtained from 128 information systems projects, behavior, outcome, clan, and self-control are empirically determined to be positively associated with the system performance of projects. However, complexity risk generates a mixed moderating effect on the relationship between control and performance. In the presence of a high complexity risk, the effects of behavior and self-control on performance are low, whereas the effectiveness of outcome and clan control increases. This finding implies that complexity risk is a double-edged sword with regard to control. Each control mode exhibits different characteristics and effectiveness under high complexity risk. Therefore, appropriate control modes should be carefully selected, and highly effective control modes, such as outcome and clan control, should be prioritized in managing complex system projects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project control and performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We do not find evidence that the use of management-initiated internal audits and financial rewards tied to lean implementation are strongly associated with more extensive lean implementation. We also present evidence of a positive relation between lean implementation and improvements in operational performance in the factories.

The second segment shows strong preferences for new products\u2014with an accompanying aversion to remanufactured products\u2014and realtively low sensitivity to price discounts. The pricing analysis examines several scenarios involving a new product manufacturer, ranging from a simple monopolist scenario to a more complex scenario involving competition with third-party remanufacturers. In contrast to the usual finding that new product prices should decrease when competitive remanufactured products enter the market, the introduction of market segments reveals a robust finding across all scenarios: when remanufactured products enter the market, the optimal price of the new product should increase.

Whereas previous studies have focused on the benefits or risks of embedded relationships that accrue to buying firms, this study simultaneously investigates the effects of a supplier's and a customer's embeddedness, arising from resource dependency, on a focal firm's financial performance in triadic supply chain relationships. Using 1,144 unique focal firm-years for U.S. firms from Compustat, we find that a supplier's and a customer's dependency both increase the focal firm's performance in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS) by increasing asset turnover (ATO). As levels of supplier and customer dependency on the focal firm increase, however, the economic benefits of customer dependency diminish beyond a certain point, while those of supplier dependency continue to increase above that threshold. Thus, our findings show the paradoxically differing risks of the supplier's versus the customer's dependency, while establishing the unequivocal economic benefits of supplier and customer relations for focal firms in the middle of concentrated triadic relationships.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['dependency', 'supply chain', 'financial performance']","The article primarily focuses on the economic aspects of supply chain relationships without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

ISO management standards reduce performance variability among suppliers and promote global trade. However, ISO standards also promote a certain degree of commonality or isomorphism between firms. If the very notion of \u2018standards\u2019 encourages a certain level of commonality between firms, then how can firms achieve a competitive advantage from implementing ISO standards? This research argues that the timing of when a firm implements an ISO standard relative to their rivals has strategic benefits. Drawing on the competitive dynamics literature we argue that firms can achieve an early mover advantage when implementing ISO 14001. However, an early mover advantage depends on the level of a firm's absorptive capacity (prior experience with ISO 9001) and the competitive intensity of their industry. This study uses longitudinal data from firms that implemented ISO 14001 at varying points in time to examine the benefits of an early mover advantage. More broadly, this research sheds light on when firms benefit the most from implementing new management standards. The results provide insights into implementing other emerging management standards.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.03.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['standards', 'competitive advantage', 'ISO 14001']","The article primarily focuses on the strategic benefits of ISO management standards and competitive dynamics, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We collate quarterly data on 3857 publicly traded firms in 19 industries from the years 1991 to 2013 (representing 99,559 firm-quarter observations). Using panel data analysis, we find that narrow product offerings, low geographical diversification, low levels of excess capacity, and low inventory slack are each positively associated with firm performance. More importantly though, we find that operational scope is associated with improved performance in unpredictable environments, whereas operational slack is associated with improved performance in unstable environments. These findings contribute to the research on operations strategy by identifying the industry-specific environmental conditions under which operational slack and operational scope are associated with firm performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.04.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational performance metrics and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The aspects of team leader experience we examine include team leader social capital (a part of the social system) and team leader experience leading projects of the same type (a part of the technical system).\n            \n            We examine four different, yet related, dimensions of a team leader's social capital, which we motivate based on the social networks literature. One dimension, team leader familiarity, suggests that social capital is created when team leaders have experience working with current team members on prior improvement projects, and that such social capital increases the likelihood of improvement project success. We develop three additional dimensions, using social network analysis (SNA), to capture the idea that the improvement team leader's social capital extends beyond the current team to include everyone the leader has previously worked with on improvement projects. Contrasting our SNA-based dimensions with team leader familiarity enables us to better understand the impact of a team leader's social capital both inside and beyond the team. We also examine the effect of a team leader's experience leading prior projects of the same type, and consider the extent to which organizational experience may moderate the impact of both team leader social capital and same-type project experience.\n            \n            Based on analysis of archival data of six sigma projects spanning six years from a Fortune 500 consumer products manufacturer, we find that two of our SNA-based dimensions of team leader social capital, as well as experience leading projects of the same type, increase the likelihood of project success. In addition, we show that organizational experience moderates the relationship between team leader same-type project experience and project success. However, this is not the case for the relationship between the dimensions of team leader social capital and project success. These results provide insights regarding how dimensions of team leader experience and organizational experience collectively impact the operational performance of improvement teams.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.05.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['social capital', 'team leader', 'improvement projects']","The article discusses social capital and its impact on project success, which touches on collaborative and inclusive practices within teams.

Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms\u2019 motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability-oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States.

Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network.

When a firm chooses to develop more innovative products and processes, product reliability outcomes become more uncertain. These uncertainties in turn may lead to unexpected warranty claims costs, as well as other costs that can erode the advantages of an innovation leadership position. This study empirically tests these propositions using publically reported warranty and financial data from 2003 to 2013, representing 482 unique firms. Consistent with prior studies, our estimation of the direct effects of firm innovativeness on financial performance shows an inverted\u2013u\u2013shaped relationship. Importantly, we find that more innovative firms also experience more unexpected product failure costs, and, consistent with organizational information processing theory, the negative impacts of these costs on financial performance extend well beyond the direct costs associated with remediating warranty claims. Further, we find that this relationship is robust to differing levels of industry innovativeness. Hence, our study suggests that product failure risks associated with firm innovativeness are significant, and act to at least partially offset the financial benefits of innovation leadership. In addition, standard accounting for product warranty claims may substantially understate the true costs associated with product failures, which appear to generate significant SG&A, fixed asset, and inventory costs above and beyond direct warranty processing costs. Our study also demonstrates a novel usage of warranty claims data. We discuss the implications of these findings for both managers and researchers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the relationship between firm innovativeness, product reliability, and financial performance without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders\u2019 expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.06.002","","JOM","Operations Management","7","['sustainability', 'accountability', 'stakeholders', 'inclusivity', 'diverse']","The article emphasizes sustainability and stakeholder accountability, indicating a focus on ethical practices and inclusivity in supply chain management.

In this study we seek to reconcile inconsistencies between extant theory and empirical findings regarding the relationship between service quality and profitability in the airline industry. More specifically, we draw on theories from strategic management, operations strategy, and economics to explain why the relationship between measures of service quality and profitability will be moderated by an airline's competitive strategy. We test our hypotheses by fitting mixed-effects models to longitudinal data obtained from several governmental databases in the context of the U.S. domestic airline industry. We find that airline strategy moderates the relationship between some service failures and profitability. Specifically, we find that mishandled baggage and customer complaints more negatively affect the profitability of focused than non-focused airlines. We also find the relationship between arrival delays on profitability is universally negative for focused airlines, but displays an inverted U-shaped relationship for non-focused airlines. Our findings provide significant contributions to the existing body of knowledge in service quality and operations strategy.

These fulfillment terms are instrumental for highly optimized retail supply chains employing automation and techniques such as pack-by-store. When fulfilling a purchase order, a supplier may commit a fulfillment error, i.e., the supplier may fail to adhere to the terms specified by the retailer. The retailer may then penalize the supplier for the fulfillment error via a chargeback deduction, which reduces the supplier's revenue. We present a study of the fulfillment errors and chargebacks that occur in practice using data collected from a major retailer's distribution center. While fulfillment errors involving incorrect product quantities and delivery times have received the most attention in the literature, we find that the majority of fulfillment errors in the context we study involve documentation, bar coding, and retail ticketing. We refer to these as correctable fulfillment errors, since they are amended at the retailer's distribution center through rework. We develop a model of inventory management with correctable fulfillment errors and use the retailer's data to assess the cost of these correctable fulfillment errors to the retailer's inventory system. Our research provides guidance to managers in identifying products and suppliers that impose large fulfillment error costs as well as in setting appropriate chargebacks for fulfillment errors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.007","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fulfillment errors and inventory management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, these flexibilities are costly to develop and a correct valuation of these capabilities is necessary to ensure that they are only deployed when the expected benefits exceed the cost. Using a set of behavioral decision-making experiments for inventory of substitutable products, we investigate how decision-makers perform when estimating the value of operational flexibility of product substitution. We found that subjects consistently overestimated the monetary value of product substitution. Furthermore, the overestimation became more acute as demand correlation increased. This behavior is not explained by risk aversion or random errors. Instead, it appears to be driven by fundamental and systematic behavioral biases when estimating the conjunctive probability of substitution.

Increasingly, brand-owning firms have been employing CMs to produce products for which performance ambiguity is high. Doing so poses challenges for the management of CM performance. As expected, we find that quality performance ambiguity has a significant negative relationship with CM conformance quality performance, as reported by the buyers (the brand-owning firms). Drawing from and expanding the quality management (QM) literature, we assess the effectiveness of key constructs, derived primarily from the \u201csupplier QM\u201d meta-construct, at mitigating the detrimental effect of ambiguity. Two constructs consistently moderate the ambiguity-CM quality performance link. Heavily emphasizing quality at the time of CM selection moderates this relationship in the expected direction (i.e., it mitigates the challenges created by ambiguity). Surprisingly, we find that using one CM amplifies the negative relationship between ambiguity and conformance quality performance. One possible explanation is that employing only one CM aggravates existing opportunism concerns with regard to conformance quality performance under high levels of ambiguity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.08.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of quality management and performance ambiguity in contract manufacturing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Customers often respond by seeking larger safety stocks (hoarding) and by ordering more than they need to meet demand (phantom ordering). Such actions cause still longer delivery times, creating positive feedbacks that intensify scarcity and destabilize supply chains. Hoarding and phantom ordering can be rational when customers compete for limited supply in the presence of uncertainty or capacity constraints. But they may also be behavioral and emotional responses to scarcity. To address this question we extend Croson et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2014) experimental study with the Beer Distribution Game. Hoarding and phantom ordering are never rational in the experiment because there is no horizontal competition, randomness, or capacity constraint; further, customer demand is constant and participants have common knowledge of that fact. Nevertheless 22% of participants place orders more than 25 times greater than the known, constant demand. We generalize the ordering heuristic used in prior research to include the possibility of endogenous hoarding and phantom ordering. Estimation results strongly support the hypothesis, with hoarding and phantom ordering particularly strong for the outliers who placed extremely large orders. We discuss psychiatric and neuroanatomical evidence showing that environmental stressors can trigger the impulse to hoard, overwhelming rational decision-making. We speculate that stressors such as large orders, backlogs or late deliveries trigger hoarding and phantom ordering for some participants even though these behaviors are irrational. We discuss implications for supply chain design and behavioral operations research.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.002","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['behavioral', 'scarcity', 'supply chains']","The article discusses behavioral responses to scarcity in supply chains, which touches on the psychological aspects of decision-making.

In their most basic form, stock-flow systems consist of resources that accumulate and flows that change their level. Managing stock-flow systems is an indispensable part of operations management, including supply chain, inventory, and capacity planning. Previous studies have shown that most people, even experts and well-educated individuals, make persistent errors when inferring the behavior of accumulation (i.e., stock) over time. However, little is known about what individual characteristics make a decision maker better or worse at understanding stock-flows.

Subjects participated in a network game in which they had to choose between private and public transportations. If a player chose public transportation, then she shared the travel cost equally with other players making the same choice, whereas if she chose private transportation, then her travel cost was fixed. Travel costs on the private route were manipulated across the two experimental conditions. In one condition, these costs were homogeneous among players; in the other condition, they were heterogeneous among players and only privately known. We found that half (none) of the player groups in the homogeneous (heterogeneous) condition converged toward the efficient equilibrium. Examination of the system dynamics shows that convergence toward efficiency was facilitated by: (1) the existence of an intermediate equilibrium choice; and (2) strategic teaching by which a farsighted player chooses strategies with poor short-term payoff in order to shift group decisions to the efficient equilibrium and thereby increase her own long-term benefit.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.07.004","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['cost-sharing', 'public transportation', 'efficiency']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of cost-sharing and system dynamics without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Together, these feedbacks can explain as much as 20% of variability in overall project costs. Comparison of model predictions with a separate set of 15 projects shows good predictive power for cost and schedule outcomes and their uncertainty.

However, empirical assessments of the effectiveness of fear appeals have yielded mixed results, leading IS security scholars and practitioners to question the validity of the conventional fear appeal framework and the manner in which fear appeal behavioral modeling theories, such as protection motivation theory (PMT), have been applied to the study of information security phenomena.  We contend that the conventional fear appeal rhetorical framework is inadequate when used in the context of information security threat warnings and that its primary behavioral modeling theory, PMT, has been misspecified in the extant information security research.  Based on these arguments, we propose an enhanced fear appeal rhetorical framework that leverages sanctioning rhetoric as a secondary vector of threats to the human asset, thereby adding the dimension of personal-relevance threat, which is critically absent from previous fear appeal frameworks and PMT-grounded security studies.  Following a hypothetical scenario research approach involving the employees of a Finnish city government, we validate the efficacy of the enhanced fear appeal framework and determine that informal sanction rhetoric effectively enhances conventional fear appeals, thus providing a significant positive influence on compliance intentions.\n\n12/31/14","https://misq.umn.edu/an-enhanced-fear-appeal-rhetorical-framework-leveraging-threats-to-the-human-asset-through-sanctioning-rhetoric.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['fear appeals', 'information security', 'compliance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of information security and the effectiveness of fear appeals in motivating compliance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced.  In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education.  This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries.  The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society.  But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources.  Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated.  Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined.  The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources\u2014knowledge, technology, and institutions\u2014through which value-creating user-centric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved.  The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement.  The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage.  Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations:  obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.\n\n12/15/14","https://misq.umn.edu/bridging-the-service-divide-through-digitally-enabled-service-innovations-evidence-from-indian-healthcare-service-providers.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","7","['service divide', 'digital capabilities', 'disadvantaged segments', 'healthcare', 'sustainable']","The article addresses the 'service divide' and focuses on enhancing digital capabilities for disadvantaged segments in society, particularly in healthcare, which aligns with themes of social equity and access.

The cocreation of service within these service systems takes place in the context of a paradoxical tension between the logic of generative and democratic innovations and the logic of infrastructural control.  Boundary resources play a critical role in managing the tension as a firm that owns the infrastructure can secure its control over the service system while independent firms can participate in the service system.  In this study, we explore the evolution of boundary resources.  Drawing on Pickering\u2019s (1993) and Barrett et al.\u2019s (2012) conceptualizations of tuning, the paper seeks to forward our understanding of how heterogeneous actors engage in the tuning of boundary resources within Apple\u2019s iOS service system.

Although information technology (IT) has been generally viewed as an effective information processing tool that enables firms to better cope with uncertainty, thus holding the potential to mitigate firm performance volatility, evidence to support this view is lacking in the literature.  We theorize that enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, a major type of enterprise IT applications, can help reduce firm risk and, in particular, we argue that, to uncover the risk reduction effect of ERP systems, a research focus on the post-implementation stage is needed.  Based on a sample of 2,127 firm-year observations, we found that ERP systems in the post-implementation stage were associated with reduced firm risk, and that the risk reduction effect was stronger for ERP systems with a greater scope of functional and operational modules, especially functional modules.  We further found that, on average, the risk reduction effect of ERP systems became greater when firms\u2019 operating environments feature higher uncertainty, while the risk reduction associated with fully deploying ERP system modules seem to level off as environmental uncertainty increases.

Routine activity theory is synthesized with survival modeling, specifically a Weibull hazard model, and users\u2019 system access behavior is investigated using seven months of field data from the institution.

Such a broadened conceptualization of service innovation emphasizes (1) innovation as a collaborative process occurring in an actor-to-actor (A2A) network, (2) service as the application of specialized competences for the benefit of another actor or the self and as the basis of all exchange, (3) the generativity unleashed by increasing resource liquefaction and resource density, and (4) resource integration as the fundamental way to innovate.  Building on these core themes, we offer a tripartite framework of service innovation:  (1) service ecosystems, as emergent A2A structures actors create and recreate through their effectual actions and which offer an organizing logic for the actors to exchange service and cocreate value; (2) service platforms, which enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of service exchange by liquefying resources and increasing resource density (facilitating easy access to appropriate resource bundles) and thereby serve as the venue for innovation; and (3) value cocreation, which views value as cocreated by the service offer(er) and the service beneficiary (e.g., customer) through resource integration and indicate the need for mechanisms to support the underlying roles and processes.

While much is known about different social, cognitive, and technical factors that influence initial adoption and use, less is known about the role of emotional factors in users\u2019 behaviors.  Through an in-depth field study conducted in two North American universities, we examine the role of emotions in how specific IT use patterns emerge.  We find that there are five different characteristics of an IT stimulus event (cues) that, when interacting in a reinforcing manner, elicit a single class of emotions (uniform affective responses) and, when interacting in an oppositional manner, elicit mixed emotions (ambivalent affective responses).  While users respond to uniform emotions with clear adaptation strategies, they deal with ambivalent emotions by combining different adaptation behaviors, a vacillating strategy between emphasizing positive and negative aspects of the stimulus.  Surprisingly, these ambivalent emotions and vacillating strategies can lead to active and positive user engagement, exhibited in task and tool adaptation behaviors and improvisational use patterns that, despite their nonconformity to terms of use, can have positive organizational implications.\n\n\n03/03/15","https://misq.umn.edu/coping-with-information-technology-mixed-emotions-vacillation-and-nonconforming-use-patterns.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['emotions', 'nonconforming', 'engagement']","The article discusses emotional factors and user engagement with IT systems, which hints at a consideration of user experience beyond traditional metrics.

This paper consists of two studies focusing on different aspects:  a quasi-field experiment conducted with employees in three hospitals affected by a severe snowstorm (labeled a federal disaster) (N = 103), where we compare the perceptual factors in the context of the disaster experience (with versus without recall), and a comparative study between a first sample group (with disaster experience) and a second, contrast sample group (with no disaster experience) of hospital employees (N= 179) from two similar hospitals.  The results show that the disaster experience changes the relationships among the perceptual factors that affect perceived usefulness.

Yet, in spite of this valuable work, it is still unclear through what mechanisms IT governance affects organizational performance.  We make a detailed argument for the mediation of strategic alignment in this process.  Strategic alignment remains a top priority for business and IT executives, but theory-based empirical research on the relative importance of the factors affecting strategic alignment is still lagging.  By consolidating strategic alignment and IT governance models, this research proposes a nomological model showing how organizational value is created through IT governance mechanisms.  Our research model draws upon the resource-based view of the firm and provides guidance on how strategic alignment can mediate the effectiveness of IT governance on organizational performance.  As such, it contributes to the knowledge bases of both alignment and IT governance literatures.  Using dyadic data collected from 131 Taiwanese companies (cross-validated with archival data from 72 firms), we uncover a positive, significant, and impactful linkage between IT governance mechanisms and strategic alignment and, further, between strategic alignment and organizational performance.  We also show that the effect of IT governance mechanisms on organizational performance is fully mediated by strategic alignment.

Although training programs and sanctions have been suggested as a means of reducing these violations, evidence shows the problem persists.  It is thus imperative to identify additional ways to reduce access-policy violations, especially for systems providing broad access to data.  We use accountability theory to develop four user-interface (UI) design artifacts that raise users\u2019 accountability perceptions within systems and in turn decrease access-policy violations.  To test our model, we uniquely applied the scenario-based factorial survey method to various graphical manipulations of a records system containing sensitive information at a large organization with over 300 end users who use the system daily.  We show that the UI design artifacts corresponding to four submanipulations of accountability can raise accountability and reduce access policy violation intentions.  Our findings have several theoretical and practical implications for increasing accountability using UI design.  Moreover, we are the first to extend the scenario-based factorial survey method to test design artifacts.  This method provides the ability to use more design manipulations and to test with fewer users than is required in traditional experimentation and research on human\u2013computer interaction.

Enacting such epistemic scripts squeezes IS theory to the middle range, where abstract reference theory concepts are directly instantiated or slightly modified to the IS context, whereas IT remains exogenous to theory by being treated as an independent variable, mediator, or moderator.  In this design, IT is often operationalized using proxies that detect the presence of IT or its variation in use or cost.  Our analysis of 143 articles published in MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the past 15 years demonstrates that over 70 percent of published theory conforms to this mode of producing IS knowledge.  This state of play has resulted in two negative consequences:  the field (1) agonizes over the dearth of original and bold theorizing over IT and (2) satisfices when integrating theory with empirics by creating incommensurate mid-range models that are difficult to consolidate.  We propose that one way to overcome these challenges is to critically examine and debate the negative impacts of the field\u2019s dominant epistemic scripts and relax them by permitting IS scholarship that more fluidly accommodates alternative forms of knowledge production.  This will push IS inquiry to the \u201cedges\u201d and emphasize, on the one hand, inductive, rich inquiries using innovative and extensive data sets and, on the other hand, novel, genuine, high-level theorizing around germane conceptual relationships between IT, information and its (semiotic) representations, and social behaviors.  We offer several exemplars of such inquiries and their results.  To promote this push, we invite alternative institutionalized forms of publishing and reviewing.  We conclude by inviting individual scholars to be more open to practices that permit richer theorizing.  These recommendations will broaden the field\u2019s knowledge ecology and permit the creation of good IS knowledge over just getting \u201chits.\u201d  We surmise that, if such changes are carried out, the field can look confidently toward its future as one of the epicenters of organizational inquiry that deal with the central forces shaping human enterprise in the 21st century.\n\n03/03/15","https://misq.umn.edu/new-state-of-play-in-information-systems-research-the-push-to-the-edges.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","6","['critical examination', 'social behaviors', 'knowledge production', 'theorizing']","The article emphasizes the need for a critical examination of existing epistemic scripts and advocates for alternative forms of knowledge production, reflecting themes of inclusivity and social impact in the field of Information Systems.

We submit that the IS strategy of a firm is likely to explain the decision rationale it applies to IS portfolio prioritization and maintain that it is critical to ensure this decision rationale is in congruence with the firm\u2019s IS strategy.  By extending prior theoretical work on IS strategy types, we develop theoretical profiles of the decision rationale applied to IS portfolio prioritization using three attributes:  communicability of decision rationale, consistency in applying decision rationale, and risk appropriateness of decision rationale.  Since the decision rationale applied for IS portfolio prioritization is often tacit, unknown even to the decision makers themselves, we employ the decision tree induction methodology to discover this tacit decision rationale.

Understanding employee outcomes is critical because of their ramifications for long-term ES success.  This paper examines the impacts of four traditional support structures (namely, training, online support, help desk support, and change management support), and peer advice ties on four key employee outcomes (namely, system satisfaction, job stress, job satisfaction, and job performance).  This paper also seeks to show that it is peer advice ties that best fill the complex informational needs of employees after an ES implementation by providing the right information at the right time and in the right context.  The proposed model was tested in a field study conducted in one business unit of a large telecommunications company and gathered data from 120 supplier liaisons over the course of a year.  Both traditional support structures and peer advice ties were found to influence the various outcomes, even after controlling for pre-implementation levels of the dependent variables.

However, with the barriers to user innovation and attrition of existing innovators, it could be challenging for firms to attract and sustain users\u2019 MDS innovation.  With the possible benefits from user innovation, and considering the challenges faced, firms need to understand how to influence potential user innovators to take part and to encourage extant user innovators to innovate again.  However, there is a lack of comprehensive research and understanding of what drives users\u2019 intentions to innovate services and the differences in the antecedents of such intention between potential and actual user innovators.  Further, although prior studies have suggested that toolkits can support user innovation, little research has theorized and empirically tested their influence.

We tested the model through survey data from potential and actual MDS user innovators on Google Android and iOS platforms.

Hence we extend previous IS research on ICT4D by adopting a critical research perspective on the macro sociopolitical context within which most ICT4D projects take place.  We illustrate this with an ethnographic study of a project that was intended to improve the education and social welfare of the aboriginal people in Taiwan.

However, our research uncovered a different story altogether\u2014a story of the aboriginal people themselves feeling marginalized and without much of a voice.

This paper analyzes knowledge production in design-science research to explain how an endogenous form of pluralism characterizes such studies, making  it problematic to associate any design-science study with a single view of knowledge production.  Instead, a design-science research study exhibits up to four different modes of reasoning, called genres of inquiry.  These genres are derived from two dualities that contrast differing knowledge goals and differing knowledge scope in the knowledge production process.  The first duality arises from the sometimes seemingly contradictory knowledge goals of science versus design.  The second duality reflects the contradiction between the scope of the knowledge produced, which may be idiographic or nomothetic.  The evolutionary and iterative nature of a design-science study compels different knowledge goals and scope at different moments throughout a project.

Institutional theorists have called for more attention to cognitive processes and structures in order to understand institutional mechanisms.  Our objective was to unpack the cognitive structure of an organizing vision to understand its role in the diffusion of IT innovations.  We focus on the know-why component of organizing visions and on social media as an IT innovation.  In a two-stage study, Stage I leveraged schema theory, the \u201corders of worth\u201d framework\u2019s six justificatory principles, and relational class analysis to discover the hierarchical structure of the social media organizing vision.  This resulted in a view of the organizing vision as comprised of four schemas, which we conceptualized as visions-in-use, and ten nested business use cases, each comprised of different combinations of the six principles.  Based on this understanding, Stage II explored how community appropriations of visions-in-use and business use cases from the repertoire provided by an organizing vision shape four facets of an organizing vision\u2014coherence, continuity, clarity, and diversity\u2014and how these facets influence diffusion of the IT innovation.

While ratings have become ubiquitous and influential on the Internet, surprisingly little empirical research has investigated how these online assessments reflect the opinion of the population at large, especially in the domain of professional services where quality is often opaque to consumers.  Building on the word-of-mouth literature, we examine the relationship between online ratings and population perceptions of physician quality.   Our study builds on prior work by leveraging a unique dataset which includes direct measures of both the offline population\u2019s perception of physician quality and consumer-generated online reviews.  As a result, we are able to examine how online ratings reflect patients\u2019 opinions about physician quality.   In sharp contrast to the widely voiced concerns by medical practitioners, we find that physicians who are rated lower in quality by the patient population are less likely to be rated online.   Although ratings provided online are positively correlated with patient population opinions, the online ratings tend to be exaggerated at the upper end of the quality spectrum.  This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of the relationship between online ratings and the underlying consumer-perceived quality, and extends prior research on online word-of-mouth to the domain of professional services.\n\n3/16/15","https://misq.umn.edu/vocal-minority-and-silent-majority-how-do-online-ratings-reflect-population-perceptions-of-quality.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['ratings', 'population perceptions', 'quality']","The article discusses online ratings and their reflection of population perceptions, but it does not emphasize social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Merely deploying emergency notification systems on college campuses, however, does not guarantee that these systems will be effective; student compliance plays a very important role in establishing such effectiveness.  Immediate compliance with alerts, as opposed to delayed compliance or noncompliance, is a key factor in improving student safety on campuses.

Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (mis)fit between a firm\u2019s plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance in deregulated markets.  We position our theory development and empirical tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S. electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development of wholesale energy markets.  We draw on the transaction cost economics, coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market sourcing intensity (MSI)\u2014or, how much it buys relative to how much it makes\u2014 and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating internal production.

Software process diversity is conceptualized as the response of a project team to such contingencies as requirements volatility, design and technological novelty, customer involvement, and the level of organizational process compliance enforced on the project.  Moreover, we conceptualize that the degree of fit (or match) between a project\u2019s software process diversity and the level of process compliance enforced on the project impacts overall project performance.  This conceptualization was empirically tested by utilizing data collected from 410 large commercial software projects of a multinational firm.  The results show that higher levels of requirements volatility, design and technological novelty, and customer involvement increased software process diversity within a project.  However, software process diversity decreased relative to increases in the level of process compliance enforced on the project.  A higher degree of fit between the process diversity and process compliance of a project, rather than the effects of those variables independently, was found to be significantly associated with a higher level of project performance, as measured in terms of project productivity and software quality.  These results indicate that increasing software process diversity in response to project-level contingencies improves project performance only when there is a concomitant increase in organizational process compliance efforts.

Consequently, a key focus of ISec research has been discovering ways to motivate individuals to engage in more secure behaviors.  Over time, the protection motivation theory (PMT) has become a leading theoretical foundation used in ISec research to help motivate individuals to change their security-related behaviors to protect themselves and their organizations.  Our careful review of the foundation for PMT identified four opportunities for improving ISec PMT research.  First, extant ISec studies do not use the full nomology of PMT constructs.  Second, only one study uses fear-appeal manipulations, even though these are a core element of PMT.  Third, virtually no ISec study models or measures fear.  Fourth, whereas these studies have made excellent progress in predicting security intentions, none of them have addressed actual security behaviors.\n\nThis article describes the theoretical foundation of these four opportunities for improvement.  We tested the nomology of PMT, including manipulated fear appeals, in two different ISec contexts that model the modern theoretical treatment of PMT more closely than do extant ISec studies.

In this paper we explore this welfare issue by examining the ability of individuals to optimally allocate consumption over time in a stylized cellular-phone usage task for which there exists a known optimal dynamic utilization policy. Actual call behavior over time is modeled using a dynamic choice model that allows decision makers to both discount the future (be myopic) and be subject to random errors when making call decisions. Our analysis provides a \u201chalf empty, half full\u201d view of intuitive optimality. Participants rapidly learn to exhibit farsightedness, yet learning is incomplete with some level of allocation errors persisting even after repeated experience. We also find evidence for an asymmetric effect in which participants who are exogenously switched from a low (high) to high (low) allowance plan make more (fewer) errors in the new plan. The effect persists even when participants make their own plan choices.

Empirical and behavioral research on insurance is at odds with whether diminishing returns (curvature of the utility function), or loss aversion and nonlinear probability weighting lead to observed consumer behavior. This lack of consensus is primarily due to the inability of standard choice data to separate different risk preferences, and the consequent need to rely on strong parametric assumptions. We design two conjoint studies (consistent with simultaneous and sequential decision making) with choices about washing machines and extended warranties, where subjects are given failure probabilities and repair costs. Using stated choice data from the surveys, we can nonparametrically identify product and risk preferences. We find that loss aversion is significantly more important than curvature and probability weights in explaining extended warranty choices. Importantly, failure to decompose risk-averse behavior into that arising from curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting leads to lower washer prices and profits. These findings are robust to alternate reference point assumptions. We rationalize the premia paid for warranties by exploring retailer incentives to price discriminate, and test the theory on complementary goods pricing. Finally, based on counterfactual analysis, forcing separate retailers to sell washers and extended warranties is not necessarily welfare enhancing as cited in the media and previous literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0879","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical and behavioral research related to consumer behavior and risk preferences in the context of extended warranties, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An indirect network effect, or positive feedback loop, arises in this context due to spatially-dependent complementarities in the availability of ethanol fuel and the installed base of ethanol-compatible vehicles. Marketers and social planners are interested in whether these effects exist, and if so, how policy might accelerate adoption of the ethanol fuel standard within a targeted population. To measure these feedback effects, I develop an econometric framework that considers the simultaneous determination of ethanol-compatible vehicle demand and ethanol fuel supply in local markets. The demand-side model considers the automobile purchase decisions of consumers and fleet operators; the supply-side model considers the ethanol market entry decisions of competing fuel retailers. The framework extends extant market entry models by endogenizing the market size shifting fuel retailer profits. I estimate the model using zip code panel data from four states over a nine-year period. The model estimates provide evidence of a network effect. Under typical market conditions, entry of an additional ethanol fuel retailer leads to a 6% increase in the probability of ethanol-compatible vehicle purchase. The entry model estimates imply that the first entrant requires a local installed base of approximately 300 ethanol-compatible vehicles to be profitable. As an application, I demonstrate that subsidizing fuel retailers to offer ethanol in selective geographic markets can be an effective policy to indirectly increase ethanol-compatible vehicle sales.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0881","","MKS","Marketing","3","['ethanol', 'policy', 'adoption', 'market']","The article discusses the adoption of alternative fuels and the role of policy in promoting ethanol-compatible vehicles, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Two studies address this question. The first study manipulates the level of blur of the exposure and the presence or absence of color in the ad image, during exposures that lasted 100 milliseconds (msec). It reveals a buffer effect of color: color contributes little to gist perception when sufficient visual detail is available and ads are typical, but color enables consumers to continue to perceive the gist of ads accurately when the exposure is blurred. The second study finds that color inversion of the entire ad deteriorates gist perception, but that color inversion of the background scene does not affect gist perception when the exposure is blurred. This provides evidence that the color composition of the central object in the ad scene plays a key role in protecting the gist perception of advertising under adverse exposure conditions. The underlying mechanism is likely to be cognitive rather than sensory.

Researchers have typically used daily data from search engines containing measures such as average bid, average ad position, total impressions, clicks, and cost for each keyword in the advertiser\u2019s campaign. A variety of random utility models have been estimated using such data and the results have helped researchers explore the factors that drive consumer click and conversion propensities. However, virtually every analysis of this kind has ignored the intraday variation in ad position. We show that estimating random utility models on aggregated (daily) data without accounting for this variation will lead to systematically biased estimates. Specifically, the impact of ad position on click-through rate (CTR) is attenuated and the predicted CTR is higher than the actual CTR. We analytically demonstrate the existence of the bias and show the effect of the bias on the equilibrium of the SSA auction. Using a large data set from a major search engine, we measure the magnitude of bias and quantify the losses suffered by the search engine and an advertiser using aggregate data. The search engine revenue loss can be as high as 11% due to aggregation bias. We also present a few data summarization techniques that can be used by search engines to reduce or eliminate the bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0884","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior in sponsored search advertising without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To help brand managers make informed decisions, it is essential that marketing mix models appropriately measure their effects. Random Utility Models that have been applied to this problem might not be adequate because they do not allow the effects of marketing instruments of one brand to spillover to preference for competing alternatives. Additionally, they have the Invariant Proportion of Substitution (IPS) property, which in some situations imposes counter-intuitive restrictions on individual choice behavior. Recognizing that effects of marketing instruments can spill across brands in a category, we propose an alternative choice model that relaxes the IPS property: the cross attributes flexible substitution logit model. We apply the model in two very different empirical settings, i.e., consumer choices of brands of refrigerated yogurt, and prescription-writing choices of physicians in the hyperlipidemia category. In both settings the proposed model provides consistent evidence that certain marketing instruments produce sales gains primarily from growing the category pie, while others produce gains from stealing share. By contrast, the random coefficient logit and generalized nested logit models both predict that gains from all marketing instruments would have similar sources.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0886","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing models and decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper explores the relationship between the number of views and how persuasive the ad is at convincing consumers to purchase or to adopt a favorable attitude towards the product. The analysis combines data on the total views of 400 video ads, and crowd-sourced measurement of advertising persuasiveness among 24,000 survey responses. Persuasiveness is measured by randomly exposing half of these consumers to a video ad and half to a similar placebo video ad, and then surveying their attitudes towards the focal product. Relative ad persuasiveness is on average 10% lower for every one million views that the video ad achieves. The exceptions to this pattern were ads that generated views and large numbers of comments, and video ads that attracted comments that mentioned the product by name. Evidence suggests that such ads remained effective because they attracted views due to humor rather than because they were outrageous.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0874","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of video advertising and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Top executives invoke these customer-centric beliefs when initiating corporate reorganizations. However, a lack of empirical evidence linking these customer-centric structures to better long-term financial performance raises doubts if corporate structure can truly foster customer centricity and better position a firm to satisfy customers and hence exhibit superior performance. The current research addresses this question by using longitudinal data (1998\u20132010) that links Fortune 500 firms\u2019 corporate-level structure to performance. Utilizing a dueling mediator model with allowance for endogeneity in a firm\u2019s organizational structure choice, the study reveals that a corporate-level customer-centric structure translates to greater customer satisfaction, but simultaneously adds coordinating costs. Further explaining customer-centric structure\u2019s record of mixed success, the benefits of increased customer satisfaction diminish (1) as competitors have already adopted customer-centric structures, (2) in fragmented markets where competitors leave few unique customer needs unaddressed, and (3) in less profitable industries.

Strategic Dynamic Pricing for New Products","Current complex dynamic markets are characterized by numerous brands, each with multiple products and price points, and differentiated on a variety of product attributes plus a large number of new product introductions. This study seeks to analyze dynamic pricing paths in a highly complex branded market, consisting of 663 products under 79 brand names of digital cameras. The authors develop a method to classify dynamic pricing strategies and analyze the choice and correlates of observed pricing paths in the introduction and early growth phase of this market. The authors find that, despite numerous recommendations in the literature for skimming or penetration pricing, market pricing dominates in practice. In particular, the authors find five patterns: skimming (20% frequency), penetration (20% frequency), and three variants of market-pricing patterns (60% frequency), where new products are launched at market prices. Skimming pricing launches the new product 16% above the market price and subsequently increases the price relative to the market price. Penetration pricing launches the new product 18% below the market price and subsequently lowers the price relative to the market price. Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their portfolios. The specific pricing paths correlate with market, firm, and brand characteristics such as competitive intensity, market pioneering, brand reputation, and experience effects.

We propose a dynamic model to help blood bank marketing managers understand how blood donations can be managed via online POE media. We analytically characterize the optimal forward-looking paid media strategies, taking into account the asymmetric costs related to shortage and excess of blood, as well as the possibility of a cost-free target donation zone.

We demonstrate that pay-per-use yields higher profits in a monopoly provided the associated psychological cost is low. In a duopoly, one firm uses selling and the other uses pay-per-use. Here, in contrast to the monopoly, selling yields higher profits than pay-per-use. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, the profits of both duopolists can increase as the psychological cost associated with pay-per-use increases. Next, we show that uncertainty in consumer use frequency does not affect pay-per-use in a monopoly, but lowers profits from selling. In a duopoly, both the seller and the pay-per-use provider obtain lower profits when use frequency is uncertain. We also analyze how pricing mechanism performance is affected if the firms cannot commit to prices, if the pay-per-use provider offers a two-part tariff, and if consumers are risk-averse.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0894","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing mechanisms for information goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, who is most influential varies across stages. Physicians with high centrality in the discussion and referral network and with high prescription volume are influential in trial but not repeat. In contrast, immediate colleagues, few of whom are nominated as a discussion or referral partner, are influential in both trial and repeat. Third, who is most influenceable also varies across stages. For trial, it is physicians who do not consider themselves to be opinion leaders, whereas for repeat, it is those located towards the middle of the status distribution as measured by network centrality.

We find a significant increase in customer expenditures attributable to customers joining the firm\u2019s community. While self-selection is a concern with field data, we rule out multiple alternative explanations. Social dollars persist over the time period observed and arose primarily in the online channel. To assess the source of the social dollar, we hypothesize and test whether it is moderated by participation behaviors conceptually linked to common attributes of customer communities. Our results reveal that posters (versus lurkers) of community content and those with more (versus fewer) social ties in the community generated more (fewer) social dollars. We found a null effect for our measure of the informational advantage expected to accrue to products that differentially benefit from content posted by like-minded community members. This overall pattern of results suggests a stronger social than informational source of economic benefits for firm operators of customer communities.

We show that a regression discontinuity (RD) approach is feasible to measure causal effects in this important context. We apply the approach to a large and unique data set of daily observations containing information on a focal advertiser as well as its major competitors. Our RD estimates demonstrate that there are significant selection biases in the more naive estimates. While a mean comparison of outcomes across positions would indicate very large position effects, we find that our RD estimates of these effects are much smaller, and exist only in some of the positions. We further investigate moderators of these effects. Position effects are stronger when the advertiser is smaller, and when the consumer has low prior experience with the keyword for the advertiser. They are weaker when the keyword phrase has specific brand or product information, when the ad copy is more specific as in exact matching options, and on weekends compared to weekdays.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0893","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of search engine advertising and econometric methods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Low transaction costs make accessing content easier for consumers. Digital technology enables firms to create nondurable \u201crental\u201d versions of their content and to restrict content to the purchasing consumer, effectively shutting down resale markets. To empirically analyze the interaction of purchase and rental markets, I design a preference measurement tool to recover consumers\u2019 intertemporal preferences through current-period choices alone. I then use these preferences to solve for a dynamic equilibrium between consumers and the firm. In the context of the online home video market, I find that when the firm is able to commit to holding prices fixed forever, providing content through the purchase market alone is sufficient. However, when the firm is unable to commit, it should serve both purchase and rental markets. Canonical theory models would predict exclusive rentals, but the purchase option enables indirect price discrimination in practice. I also find that when consumers place a premium on accessing new content, they are less likely to intertemporally substitute, thereby increasing the firm\u2019s pricing power. Consistent with theory, commitment to future prices increases profits considerably. This finding supports the rigid pricing structure of such retailers as Apple, despite studios\u2019 push toward more pricing flexibility.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0896","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of content pricing and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Recently marketing scholars proposed the construction of efficient heterogeneous designs where different respondents or groups of respondents get different subdesigns, and demonstrated substantial efficiency gain when such heterogeneous designs are employed. A significant hurdle in the widespread adoption of heterogeneous designs is the high computation cost, even when the number of subdesigns contained in the heterogeneous design is restricted to be small. In this paper we propose a new approach for the construction of efficient heterogeneous choice designs. In contrast to extant approaches that are based on an exact design framework where it is computationally prohibitive to do an exhaustive search to find a globally optimal design, our proposed approach is based on the continuous design framework where well-established mathematical theories can be leveraged for quick identification of a globally optimal design. The proposed approach makes it feasible to generate a highly efficient choice design that is completely heterogeneous\u2014a unique subdesign for each individual respondent in the choice experiment. The proposed approach is the first in the marketing literature to find a completely heterogeneous choice design with assured high global design efficiency using the continuous design framework. Results from simulation and empirical studies demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach over extant approaches in constructing efficient heterogeneous choice designs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0897","","MKS","Marketing","3","['heterogeneous', 'design', 'respondents']","The article discusses the construction of heterogeneous choice designs, which implies a consideration for diverse respondent groups.

Our theoretical framework analyzes market equilibria under competition from counterfeiting as well as under monopoly branding. A key theoretical prediction is that emerging markets can be self-corrective with respect to counterfeiting issues in the following sense: First, counterfeiters can earn positive profits by pooling with authentic brands only when consumers have good faith in the market (i.e., they believe there is low probability that any product is a counterfeit). When the proportion of counterfeits in the market exceeds a cutoff value, brands invest in self-differentiation from the competitive-fringe counterfeiters. Second, to attain a separating equilibrium with counterfeiters, branded incumbents upgrade the searchable quality (e.g., appearance) of their products more and improve the experiential quality (e.g., functionality) less compared with monopoly equilibrium. However, in the pooling equilibrium with sporadic counterfeits, authentic firms instead may invest in experiential quality to attract more of the expert consumers who are well versed in quality. This prediction uncovers the nature of product differentiation in the searchable dimension and helps with analyzing real-world innovation strategies employed by authentic firms in response to entries by counterfeit entities. In addition, welfare analysis hints at a nonlinear relationship between social welfare and intellectual property enforcement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0867","","MKS","Marketing","3","['counterfeiting', 'intellectual property', 'social welfare']","The article discusses counterfeiting in emerging markets and touches on social welfare in relation to intellectual property enforcement, indicating some awareness of broader societal implications.

Frustrated with the negative country-of-origin (COO) stereotype imposed on them, many domestic brands from emerging markets follow a variety of approaches to disguise their COO and pretend to be foreign. This paper studies the strategic aspects of this phenomenon. We consider an experience good market where consumers learn about each brand\u2019s quality, using its COO as a prior. Each firm can invest in product quality or COO dissociation; the former generates better quality signals while the latter simply masks the firm\u2019s COO identity. The analysis reveals a few main insights. Sharing a reputation leads to a common good problem where firms free-ride on each other\u2019s quality investments. As a high quality firm dissociates itself from the stereotype, it ceases to contribute to the COO image but also prevents its low quality peers from free-riding on it. This incurs a negative direct effect but a positive strategic effect on the group image. Consequently, a country\u2019s COO image may actually improve when more high quality brands shun their identities and pretend to be foreign. In equilibrium, COO image improves monotonically as firms become more efficient in providing quality. However, the prevalence of COO dissociation may first increase then decrease. We discuss the implications of these results for emerging market brands as well as policy makers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2014.0895","","MKS","Marketing","3","['stereotype', 'country-of-origin', 'quality']","The article touches on the concept of stereotypes related to country-of-origin, which hints at social perceptions and branding strategies.

The explosion of social media has significantly increased the scope and impact of social learning among consumers. This paper studies observational learning in networks of friends versus strangers. A consumer decides whether to adopt a product after receiving a private signal about product quality and observing the actions of others. The preference for the product has greater heterogeneity in the stranger-network than in the friend-network. We show that when the network is small, observing friends\u2019 actions helps the consumer make more accurate inferences about quality. As the network grows, however, the stranger-network becomes more effective. Underlying these results are two competing effects of network heterogeneity on social learning. These are the individual preference effect, which allows one to make a better quality judgment when the preference element of past actions is more certain, and the social conforming effect, wherein private signals are underused in quality judgment as people follow others\u2019 actions. We find cascading is more likely to occur in the friend-network than in the stranger-network. For a high-quality firm, the stranger-network generates greater sales than the friend-network when the network size is sufficiently large or the private signal is sufficiently accurate. We also examine the existence of experts and firms using advertising to influence consumers. Finally, we show how networks that are highly homogeneous or heterogeneous could impede observational learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0902","","MKS","Marketing","3","['networks', 'social learning', 'heterogeneity']","The article discusses social learning and network effects, but it does not emphasize social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We model how advertisers compete for ad positions in sponsored listings and, conditional on the list of sponsored ads, how online consumers search for information and make purchase decisions. On the consumer side, assuming that users browse information from top to bottom and adopt a sequential search strategy, we develop a two-stage model of consumer search (whether to click and whether to stop the search) that extends the standard sequential search framework in economics literature. On the advertiser side, it is very difficult to fully specify the optimal strategies of advertisers because the equilibrium outcome depends on variables that researchers do not observe. As we have an incomplete model of advertiser competition, we propose using the necessary condition that, at equilibrium, no advertiser will find another available ad position more valuable than the one it has chosen. Using a data set obtained from a search engine, we find that consumers can be classified into two segments that exhibit distinct search behaviors. For advertisers, the value of search advertising comes primarily from terminal clicks, which represent the last link (including organic results) clicked by an online user. We also demonstrate that the value of ad positions depends not only on the identities and positions of the advertisers in sponsored listings but also the composition of online consumers who exhibit distinct search behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0903","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and advertising strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We show that current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on expected cash flow from the next period but not on expected cash flows from more distant future periods. Therefore, market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value. Market stability increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk, whereas market turbulence increases the impact of R&D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.

The tendency of firms to avoid productivity-enhancing technologies and remain small to avoid transparency has been dubbed the \u201cPeter Pan Syndrome.\u201d We examine whether firms make the trade-off between productivity and transparency by examining IT adoption in the Indian retail sector. We find that computer technology adoption is lower when firms are motivated to avoid transparency. Specifically, technology adoption is lower when there is greater corruption, but higher when there is better enforcement and auditing. So, firms have a higher productivity gain threshold to adopt computers in corrupt business environments that suffer from patchy and variable enforcement of the tax laws. Not accounting for this motivation to hide from the formal sector underestimates productivity gains from computer adoption. Thus, in addition to their direct effects on the economy, enforcement, auditing, and corruption can have indirect effects through their negative impact on adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies that also increase operational transparency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0921","","MKS","Marketing","4","['transparency', 'corruption', 'productivity']","The article discusses the trade-off between productivity and transparency in the context of emerging markets, highlighting issues of corruption and regulatory compliance.

The majority of the value comes from reviews on restaurant quality, and contextual comments are more valuable than numerical ratings in reviews.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0926","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic aspects of online reviews without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We use data from two large-scale field experiments and two lab experiments to show that, although personalization can substantially enhance banner effectiveness, its impact hinges on its interplay with timing and placement factors. First, personalization increases click-through especially at an early information state of the purchase decision process. Here, banners with a high degree of content personalization (DCP) are most effective when a consumer has just visited the advertiser\u2019s online store, but quickly lose effectiveness as time passes since that last visit. We call this phenomenon overpersonalization. Medium DCP banners, on the other hand, are initially less effective, but more persistent, so that they outperform high DCP banners over time. Second, personalization increases click-through irrespective of whether banners appear on motive congruent or incongruent display websites. In terms of view-through, however, personalization increases ad effectiveness only on motive congruent websites, but decreases it on incongruent websites. We demonstrate in the lab how perceptions of ad informativeness and intrusiveness drive these results depending on consumers\u2019 experiential or goal-directed Web browsing modes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0930","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of personalized online advertising effectiveness without addressing any social justice themes, ethical considerations, or issues of diversity and inclusion.

We present a model of consumer choice that examines trade-offs between substitutable products (theatrical and video forms), the possibility of purchasing both alternatives, a congestion externality affecting consumption at theaters with heterogeneous consumer groups, and a decay in the quality of the content over time. Our model permits a normative study of the impact of shorter release windows (zero\u2013three months) for which there is a scarcity of relevant data. We characterize the market conditions under which a studio makes video release time and price selections indicative of direct-to-video, day-and-date, and delayed video release tactics. During seasons of peak congestion, we establish that day-and-date strategies are optimal for high-quality films with high content durability (i.e., films whose content tends to lead consumers to purchase both alternatives) whereas prices are set to perfectly segment the consumer market for films with low content durability. We find that lower congestion effects provide studios with incentives to delay release and price the video to induce multiple purchasing behavior for films with higher content durability. However, an increase in congestion effects can, in certain cases, actually lead to higher studio profitability. We also show that, at the lower range of quality, an increase in movie quality should often be accompanied by a later video release time. Surprisingly, however, we observe the opposite result at the upper range of movie quality: an increase in quality can justify an earlier release of the video.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0936","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of film distribution strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a model in which consumers are heterogeneous in self-regulating consumption by balancing short-run needs (e.g., hydration and mood) with long-term goals (e.g., health). The model has two novel features: (1) utility depends on the match between occasion-specific needs and product attributes, and (2) dynamics of consumption and stockpiling are at the level of product attributes. We estimate the model using unique intraday beverage consumption, activity, and psychological needs data. We find that only a third of individuals do not self-regulate. Of the two-thirds who self-regulate, over 40% self-regulate adaptively based on past choice, whereas 25% self-regulate both adaptively and anticipating future needs. Our attribute\u2013need match model enables us to assess unmet demand for new products with attributes that match co-occurring occasion-specific needs. Specifically, we find that a product satisfying a combination of \u201chealth-hydrating\u201d needs expands overall beverage consumption by as much as 5%. Our framework of modeling heterogeneity in self-regulation by balancing short-run needs with long-term goals is more broadly applicable in contexts where situational needs vary, and long-term effects are gradual and hard to discern (e.g., nutrition, smoking, and preventive health care).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0939","","MKS","Marketing","2","['health', 'needs', 'self-regulating']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and product attributes without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We propose an empirical model in which consumers make dynamic purchase decisions under consumption uncertainty, accounting for the constraints imposed by the instantaneous quota. Applying the model to an online DVD rental data set, we find that (1) consumers incur a large disutility (\u223c$8) from stockout (i.e., unmet consumption needs); (2) such a disutility drives consumers' overpurchase of the service quota as a way to avoid potential stockout situations; and (3) the dynamics of overpurchase are driven by the interplay between trends in consumption needs and the magnitude of consumers' plan-switching costs. We run counterfactual exercises to better understand how the instantaneous quota and stockout risk affect consumers' consumption rates, purchase decisions, and firm profitability. We find that the instantaneous quota induces a greater stockout compared with a monthly quota. We further demonstrate that the company should recognize the drivers of the dynamics in overpurchase to balance short- and long-term profitability\u2014for example, by offering targeted discounts to customers with excess overpurchase.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0942","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price discrimination and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Flexibility refers to the ability of a utility function to impose minimal prior restrictions on demand elasticities. Global regularity refers to the ability of a utility function to satisfy regularity properties required by economic theory in the entire feasible space of variables. The tractable utility functions used so far are either inflexible, which could yield inaccurate estimates of underlying elasticities, or do not satisfy global regularity, which can result in invalid expressions of likelihood and invalid policy simulations. I tackle this problem by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for global regularity of Basic Translog utility. Using simulated and scanner data, I show that the proposed demand system yields better model fit, more accurately captures underlying elasticities, and yields substantially different results in counterfactuals compared to alternatives used in prior literature. Specifically, unlike the alternatives used so far, the proposed demand system allows for complementarities between goods, and more accurately captures the extent of their inferiority, the extent of their substitutability, and asymmetries in cross price effects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0908","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of utility-maximization and demand estimation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

At the time of launch, we assume that the monopolist has incomplete information about the true demand curve. Despite the lack of objective information the firm must set a retail price to maximize total profits. To model this environment, we develop a novel two-period non-Bayesian framework where the monopolist sets the price in each period based only on a nonparametric set of all feasible demand curves. Optimal prices are dynamic as prices in any period allow the firm to learn about demand and improve future pricing decisions. Our main results show that the direction of dynamic introductory prices (versus static prices) depends on the type of heterogeneity in the market. We find that (1) when consumers have homogeneous preferences, introductory dynamic price is higher than the static price; (2) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has no ex ante information, the introductory dynamic price is the same as the static price; and (3) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has ex ante information, the introductory dynamic price is lower than the static price.

Thus, in contrast to the current literature, our analysis shows that both budget-constrained and unconstrained advertisers could bid more than their own valuation.

Specifically, we seek insight on which socioeconomic class is more likely to adopt, and why. We model adoption as a two-stage process of modern retail choice followed by category expenditures within a shopping trip. We find a nonmonotonic (V-shaped) relationship between socioeconomic class and preferences for modern retail; specifically, modern retail spending and relative preference are greater among the upper and lower middle classes, relative to the middle middle class. Upper middle class preference of modern retail is driven by credit card acceptance, shorter store distance (relative to other segments), and higher vehicle ownership; whereas lower prices and low travel costs drive the preferences of the lower middle class. Modern retail is preferred more for branded and less for perishable categories. Interestingly, the lower middle class share of modern grocery retail\u2019s revenues is largest, and this share is projected to grow as prices fall and store density increases.

Consumers choose which firm to patronize and how much personal information to provide it with. We show that firms maximize profits by focusing on a single revenue source and competing at the extensive rather than the intensive margin, outperforming competitors by attracting a larger customer base. We also show that competition drives the provision of services with a low level of consumer information disclosure (high level of privacy), but higher competition intensity in the marketplace need not improve privacy when consumers exhibit low willingness to pay. Our findings are relevant to the business models of Internet firms and contribute to inform the regulatory debate on consumer privacy.

We model this as a decision between whether control rights over a noncontractible decision variable (the choice of some marketing activity) are better held by suppliers (the marketplace mode) or by the intermediary (the reseller mode). Whether the marketplace or the reseller mode is preferred depends on whether independent suppliers or the intermediary have more important information relevant to the optimal tailoring of marketing activities for each specific product. We show that this trade-off is shifted toward the reseller mode when marketing activities create spillovers across products and when network effects lead to unfavorable expectations about supplier participation. If the reseller has a variable cost advantage (respectively, disadvantage) relative to the marketplace, then the trade-off is shifted toward the marketplace for long-tail (respectively, short-tail) products. We thus provide a theory of which products an intermediary should offer in each mode. We also provide some empirical evidence that supports our main results.

Furthermore, innovations in EPU earn a significant negative risk premium in the Fama\u2013French 25 size\u2013momentum portfolios. Among the Fama\u2013French 25 portfolios formed on size and momentum returns, the portfolio with the greatest EPU beta underperforms the portfolio with the lowest EPU beta by 5.53% per annum, controlling for exposure to the Carhart four factors as well as implied and realized volatility.

The firm\u2019s objective is to maximize its long-term average revenue given a steady arrival of strategic customers. In particular, customers arrive over time, are strategic in timing their purchases, and are heterogeneous along two dimensions: their valuation for the firm\u2019s product and their willingness to wait before purchasing or leaving. The customers' patience and valuation may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. For this general formulation, we prove that the firm may restrict attention to cyclic pricing policies, which have length, at most, twice the maximum willingness to wait of the customer population. To efficiently compute optimal policies, we develop a dynamic programming approach that uses a novel state space that is general, capable of handling arbitrary problem primitives, and that generalizes to finite horizon problems with nonstationary parameters. We analyze the class of monotone pricing policies and establish their suboptimality in general. Optimal policies are, in a typical scenario, characterized by nested sales, where the firm offers partial discounts throughout each cycle, offers a significant discount halfway through the cycle, and holds its largest discount at the end of the cycle. We further establish a form of equivalence between the problem of pricing for a stream of heterogeneous strategic customers and pricing for a pool of heterogeneous customers who may stockpile units of the product.

Vice-virtue bundles are item aggregates with varying proportions of both vice and virtue, holding overall quantity constant. Four studies compare choice and perceptions of differently composed vice-virtue bundles relative to one another and to pure vice and pure virtue options. Although multiple consumer segments can be identified, results suggest that people overall tend to prefer vice-virtue bundles with small  (14)(14) to medium  (12)(12) proportions of vice rather than large  (34)(34) proportions of vice. Moreover, people generally rate vice-virtue bundles with small vice proportions as healthier but similarly tasty as bundles with larger vice proportions. For most individuals, choice patterns are different from those predicted by variety-seeking accounts alone. Instead, these findings provide evidence of asymmetric effectiveness of small vice and virtue proportions at addressing taste and health goals, respectively.

ICUs currently lack systematic admission criteria, largely because the impact of ICU admission on patient outcomes has not been well quantified. This makes evaluating the performance of candidate admission strategies difficult. Using a large patient-level data set of more than 190,000 hospitalizations across 15 hospitals, we first quantify the cost of denied ICU admission for a number of patient outcomes. We use hospital operational factors as instrumental variables to handle the endogeneity of the admission decisions and identify important specification issues that are required for this approach to be valid. Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance. By simulating a hospital with 21 ICU beds, we find that we could save about $1.9 million per year by using an optimal policy based on observables designed to reduce readmissions and hospital length of stay. We also discuss the role of unobserved patient factors, which physicians may discretionarily account for when making admission decisions, and show that including these unobservables could result in a more than threefold increase in benefits compared to just optimizing the policy over the observable patient factors.

GCs have a broad oversight role within the firm, including keeping the firm in compliance with laws and regulations and dealing with potential violations with respect to financial reporting. Several high-profile U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations have resulted in lawsuits or indictments against GCs for perpetrating financial fraud and caused many to ask: where were the gatekeepers? As such, we examine the conditions under which GCs may stray from their primary role as gatekeepers. Mainly, we empirically investigate claims that compensation can impair the independence or compromise the professional judgment of a GC. We measure the level of compensation using the GC\u2019s presence or absence in the top five officers of the firm by compensation. Results are consistent with GCs straying from their role as gatekeepers, to some extent, when highly compensated in a manner similar to the CEO and CFO. In particular, firms with highly compensated GCs have lower financial reporting quality and more aggressive accounting practices, including management of the litigation reserve. However, the results also show that highly compensated GCs play an important gatekeeping role in keeping the firm in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Thus, highly compensated GCs appear to tolerate moderately aggressive behavior but constrain it such that it would not result in violation of securities laws and jeopardize their standing within the firm.

We show that if customers who value quality more possess an outside option such as a substitute product, as may be the case with replacement buyers, a seller may find it optimal to follow a low-quality product with a higher-quality one, the latter being targeted at replacement buyers. Furthermore, the ability of the seller to commit to future qualities accentuates the sequential increase in quality in the presence of such buyers.

Although adaptive models can provide superior one-step-ahead forecasts, their application to multiperiod forecasting is challenging when the underlying parameter variation process is not correctly specified. The authors propose a methodology based on the Chebyshev approximation method (CAM), which provides a parsimonious substitute for the measurement updating process in the forecasting period, to help forecasters improve multiperiod accuracy in the case of parameter variation misspecification. In two empirical applications concerning the sales growth of new brands, CAM exhibits superior forecasting performance compared to a variety of benchmarks. CAM\u2019s properties are further explored through extensive simulations, which suggest that the proposed method is more likely to increase forecast accuracy when parameter variation is more systematic but misspecified because of uncertainty regarding its exact functional form.

Although we find only limited evidence that FoFs exhibit skill when selecting hedge funds, we find strong evidence that FoFs make skillful termination decisions. After FoFs divest from a hedge fund, those hedge funds subsequently underperform and fail more often. Our evidence indicates that FoFs learn and skillfully process information about their portfolio funds after they become investors, enabling them to forecast poor future performance.

In this paper, we examine the dynamic change of the products purchased online over time in the presence of this type of uncertainty. Using individual-level transaction data, we find that consumers purchase products with a high degree of product uncertainty as their online shopping experiences help them better estimate product quality. Our results also show that the average and highest prices of market baskets decrease (around 1%) when online shopping experience increases (10%). This implies that online consumers are reluctant to buy expensive products with only digitally transferred information, whereas they tend to purchase more of the cheaper products online along with their accumulated online shopping experience. We also verify the interaction effects of product uncertainty and product price on online consumers\u2019 purchase decision. When online consumers buy products priced under $50, they readily buy products with a high degree of product uncertainty regardless of their online shopping experience. But consumers are unlikely to buy expensive products online if there is a high degree of product uncertainty, even when they have accumulated much online shopping experience. In addition, we find that online vendors can effectively overcome product-level uncertainty by taking advantage of retailer reputation in the physical world and through the use of digitized video commercials. Our study on the dynamics in the set of products purchased online expands the understanding of consumer purchase behavior under uncertainty.

We identify three effects\u2014predation, bail-out, and abetment\u2014that can change firms\u2019 behavior from their actions in the absence of financial distress. The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier\u2019s incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor\u2019s predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy. Together these effects stress that a firm\u2019s bankruptcy potential can hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers. They also provide guidelines for firms\u2019 operational decisions in such situations, a rationale for observed firm actions surrounding bankruptcies, and motivation for policies supporting reorganization and relaxing broad enforcement of nondiscriminatory pricing regulations.

We use difference-in-differences models with staggered adoption dates to estimate the treatment effect of IT monitoring on theft and productivity. We find significant treatment effects in reduced theft and improved productivity that appear to be primarily driven by changed worker behavior rather than worker turnover. We examine four mechanisms that may drive this productivity result: economic and cognitive multitasking, fairness-based motivation, and perceived increases of general oversight. The observed productivity results represent substantial financial benefits to both firms and the legitimate tip-based earnings of workers.

Disease Group Lobbying and Federal Funding for Biomedical Research","Private interest groups lobby politicians to influence public policy. However, little is known about how lobbying influences the policy decisions made by federal agencies. We study this through examining lobbying by advocacy groups associated with rare diseases for funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world\u2019s largest funder of biomedical research. Disease group lobbying for NIH funding has been controversial, with critics alleging that it distorts public funding toward research on diseases backed by powerful groups. Our data reveal that lobbying is associated with higher political support, in the form of congressional \u201csoft earmarks\u201d for the diseases. Lobbying increases with disease burden and is more likely to be associated with changes in NIH funding for diseases with higher scientific opportunity, suggesting that it may have a useful informational role. Only special grant mechanisms that steer funding toward particular diseases, which comprise less than a third of the NIH\u2019s grants, are related to earmarks. Thus, our results suggest that lobbying by private groups influences federal funding for biomedical research. However, the channels of political influence are subtle, affect a small portion of funding, and may not necessarily have a distortive effect on public science.

Using three years of network data for students at an Indian college, we evaluate the effect of peers on network growth. We find strong evidence that interacting with random, but well-connected, roommates causes significant growth of a focal student\u2019s network. Further, we find that this growth also implies an increase in how close an actor moves to a network\u2019s center and whether that actor is likely to serve as a network bridge.

We hypothesize that performance information and details of the production process affect entitlements, which in turn influence bargaining behavior. We find that, without performance information, subjective entitlements are mostly mutually consistent, and bargaining mainly ends with an equal split. In stark contrast, negotiators derive strong, mutually inconsistent, subjective entitlements when there is performance information. These subjective entitlements affect opening proposals, concessions, and bargaining duration and lead to asymmetric agreements. Moreover, given performance information, endogenous variations in entitlements influence bargaining, suggesting an independent role of subjective entitlements. Production uncertainties influence bargaining, especially when performance information is present, but do not substantially mitigate the effect of entitlements. Theoretical bargaining models allowing for reference points or fairness principles can partly account for the empirical results.

Increased reliance on automation has also led to requirements for standardization of content-delivery formats. This paper examines how the memorability of banner advertising changed with the introduction of new standards regularizing its format. Using data from randomized field tests, we find evidence that for most ads, ad effectiveness falls as the use of standard formats rises. The decline is smaller when a standardized ad appears to be more original (such as ads created by an ad agency). Therefore, a likely explanation is that increased use of a standard format makes it harder for basic ads to distinguish themselves from their competition because the ad format commands less attention.

When I examine the channels through which companies benefit from CSR, I find that labor productivity and sales growth increase after the vote. Finally, I document that close call CSR proposals differ from non-close proposals along several dimensions.

To incorporate brand-SKU hierarchy effects, we use Bayesian hierarchical clustering inherent in a nested Dirichlet process to simultaneously partition brands, and SKUs conditional on brands, into groups of \u201csimilarity clusters.\u201d We examine cluster memberships and postprocess the Markov chain Monte Carlo output to infer cluster properties by accounting for parameter uncertainty. Our proposed approach lends to a spatial competition interpretation in latent attribute space and helps uncover the extent to which competition across SKUs in the latent attribute space is local or global. In a related vein, we discuss the implications of well-defined groups of similar SKUs as subcategory or submarket boundaries in latent attribute space. We empirically test our model using aggregate beer category sales data from a midsize U.S. retail chain. We find that branding hierarchy effects dominate those from product similarity. We find that the model partitions the 15 brands in the data into 4 brand clusters and the 96 SKUs into 25 SKU clusters conditional on brand cluster membership. In estimating a set of models of spatial interproduct competition, we find that SKU competition is more local than global in that only subsets of products compete within groups of comparable products. Finally, we discuss the substantive implications of our results.

We present model-free evidence that whereas high average quality helps in retaining customers, high variability leads to higher termination rates. Apart from these main effects, we use model-free evidence to document the presence of (a) an interaction effect between average service quality and its variability on termination rates, (b) customer learning about service quality over time, and (c) a slower rate of learning among households that experience high variability. We postulate a mechanism involving risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect, and test this against several alternative explanations. We show that it is important to consider variability in quality while inferring the impact of improvements to average quality\u2014ignoring the interaction effect between average quality and variability leads to an 18%\u201364% (5%\u201331%) overestimation (underestimation) of quality improvement elasticities among high-variability (low-variability) households.

We gathered unique and proprietary data from 33 VCs and 308 ventures that sought Series A funding from those VCs. We show that VC assessment of ventures predicts VC investment, and venture technical competence predicts subsequent venture failure. This means that VCs that overassess ventures are more likely to invest in firms that are more likely to fail. We then show that higher VC technical competence leads to lower errors in assessment, but that greater similarity between the VC and venture in technical competence leads to higher assessments, ceteris paribus.

Should it patent at all? Many companies engaged in an innovation race seek a patenting strategy that balances protection of their intellectual property against the knowledge spillovers resulting from disclosure requirements. Not much is known about factors that determine the patenting strategy best able to resolve this trade-off. Although scholars in various management, economics, and engineering disciplines have researched patents and patenting regimes, little work has addressed the normative issues that pertain to forming an appropriate firm-level patenting strategy. We develop an inventory of real-life patenting strategies and integrate them into a coherent framework. Our simulation model characterizes the optimal patenting choices for different environmental and firm-level contingencies while capturing the dynamics between competing firms. We identify the firm\u2019s research and development strategy as the most salient determinant of its optimal patenting strategy. Our research contributes to establishing a contingency theory of patenting strategies.

The value of downstream sales information to the upstream firm stems from improving upstream order fulfillment forecast accuracy. Such an improvement can lead to lower safety stock and better service. Based on the data collected from a consumer packaged goods company, we empirically show that, if the company includes the downstream sales data to forecast orders, the improvement in the mean squared forecast error ranges from 7.1% to 81.1% across all studied products. Theoretical models in the literature, however, suggest that the value of information sharing should be zero for over half of our studied products. To reconcile the gap between the literature and the empirical observations, we develop a new theoretical model. Whereas the literature assumes that the decision maker strictly adheres to a given inventory policy, our model allows him to deviate, accounting for private information held by the decision maker, yet unobservable to the econometrician. This turns out to reconcile our empirical findings with the literature. These \u201cdecision deviations\u201d lead to information losses in the order process, resulting in a strictly positive value of downstream information sharing. Furthermore, we empirically quantify and show the significance of the value of operations knowledge\u2014the value of knowing the downstream replenishment policy.

Evidence from Pay for CEO Credentials","Market-based theories predict that differences in CEO skills lead to potentially large differences in pay, but it is challenging to quantify the CEO skill premium in pay. In a first step toward overcoming this empirical challenge, we code detailed biographical information for a large sample of CEOs for a panel of S&P 1500 firms between 1993 and 2005 to identify specific reputational, career, and educational credentials that are indicative of skills. Newly appointed CEOs earn up to a 5% or $280,000 total pay premium per credential decile, which is concentrated among CEOs with better reputational and career credentials, those with the very best credentials, and those who run large firms. Consistent with the unique economic mechanism of market-based theories, CEO credentials have a positive impact on firm performance. The performance differential for newly appointed CEOs is up to 0.5% per credential decile and is also concentrated among CEOs with better reputational and career credentials and those at large firms. Credentials are positively correlated with unobserved CEO heterogeneity in pay and performance, which further validates our hypothesis that boards use them as publicly observable signals of otherwise hard-to-gauge CEO skills. In all, our results offer direct evidence in support of market-based explanations of the overall rise in CEO pay.

Theoretical analyses predict that consumer actions to avoid advertising impose externalities on other consumers. We investigate the extent of such externalities in the context of the U.S. Do Not Call (DNC) registry by exploiting the exogenous timing of the enforcement of the registry.

An increase in the first wave of registrations by 1% was associated with a 3.1% increase in subsequent registrations.

My objective is twofold. First, I study fixed proportions technology under demand uncertainty in comparison with the flexible and dedicated technologies. I show that fixed proportions technology has a cost-pooling value over dedicated technology, which is larger than the capacity-pooling value of flexible technology over dedicated technology. I identify the critical role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which decreases in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value increases in demand correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability. However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted as a response to a change in the business environment should differ depending on the contract type.

In our design, managers can assign a goal to their workers by setting a certain level of performance on the work task. We establish our theoretical conjectures by developing a model in which assigned goals act as reference points to workers\u2019 intrinsic motivation. Consistent with our model, we find that managers set goals that are challenging but attainable for a worker of average ability. Workers respond to these goals by increasing effort and performance and by decreasing on-the-job leisure activities with respect to the no-goal-setting baseline. Finally, we study the interaction between goal setting and monetary rewards and find, in line with our theoretical model, that goal setting is most effective when monetary incentives are strong. These results suggest that goal setting may produce intrinsic motivation and increase workers\u2019 performance beyond what is achieved by using solely monetary incentives.

I show that in many cases, the firm wants to expose itself to risk, and I outline general conditions that need to be satisfied for this result.

This is the case for many linear demand and constant marginal cost settings (monopolies, differentiated Bertrand firms, or differentiated Cournot firms selling substitutes) where the exogenous parameter is a demand, or a marginal cost shifter results in the monopoly (or both of the competitors if the risks are not too positively correlated) voluntarily exposing itself to risk.

Using an emergency department\u2019s (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we find that patients\u2019 average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17% decrease in average LOS and a 9% decrease in average wait time relative to the control group\u2014a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance stems from the physicians\u2019 increased ownership over patients and resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues.

We focus, in particular, on employees\u2019 blogging behavior. The model incorporates two key features that are ubiquitous in blogging forums: users face (1) a trade-off between blog posting and blog reading; and (2) a trade-off between work-related and leisure-related content. We apply the model to a unique data set comprising the complete details of the blog posting and reading behavior of employees over a 15-month period at a Fortune 1000 IT services and consulting firm. Despite getting a higher utility from work-related blogging, employees nevertheless publish a significant number of leisure posts. This is partially because the creation of leisure posts has a significant positive spillover effect on the readership of work posts. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate that leisure-related blogging has positive spillovers for work-related blogging, and hence a policy of abolishing leisure-related content creation can inadvertently have adverse consequences on work-related content creation in an enterprise setting. When organizations restrict leisure blogging, the sharing of online work-related knowledge decreases and this in turn can also reduce employee performance rating. Overall, blogging within enterprises by employees during their work day can have positive long-term benefits for organizations.

Focusing on commodity storage, we identify a deficiency of approximate linear programming (ALP), which we address by developing a novel approach to derive relaxations of approximate linear programs. We apply our approach to obtain a class of tractable ALP relaxations, also subsuming an existing method. We provide theoretical support for the use of these ALP relaxations rather than their associated approximate linear programs. Applied to existing natural gas storage instances, our ALP relaxations significantly outperform their corresponding approximate linear programs. Our best ALP relaxation is both near optimal and competitive with, albeit slower than, state-of-the-art methods for computing heuristic policies and lower bounds on the value of commodity storage, but is more directly applicable for dual (upper) bound estimation than these methods. Our approach is potentially relevant for the approximate solution of MDPs that arise in the real option management of other commodity conversion assets, as well as the valuation of real and financial options that depend on forward curve dynamics.

Two model-identification methods are examined, based on maximum-likelihood estimation and the generalized method of moments. The latter allows for an operational-statistics approach, combining model estimation and performance optimization by tailoring the estimation error to business-relevant loss functions.

This paper examines the dual incentive and sorting effects of performance pay in a simple contracting model of endogenous participation. Unless the manager is highly risk averse, sorting dampens optimal pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) because PPS beyond a nominal amount transfers unnecessary (information) rent to the manager. This helps explain why empirical estimates of PPS are much lower than predictions from models of moral hazard alone. The model also predicts that sorting under asymmetric information causes the firm to turn away more candidates than would be efficient; PPS increases in the cost of hiring the manager and in the manager's outside option, but decreases in output risk, information risk, and managerial risk aversion; and the firm becomes more selective in hiring as either the manager's outside option, the cost of hiring, risk aversion, output risk, or information risk increases.

Information asymmetry, however, also changes during the fiscal quarter. Firms disclose information periodically, and in between disclosure dates, traders can obtain private information, and adverse-selection risk increases. Such temporary increases in information asymmetry are usually considered to be diversifiable or too small to impact expected stock returns. In addition, investors may postpone trades or sell other assets in their portfolio on high information asymmetry days. We, however, find that returns increase significantly on days during the fiscal quarter when adverse-selection risk is high and liquidity low.

Evidence from Airlines' On-Time Performance","We examine if and how incumbent firms respond to entry and entry threats using nonprice modes of competition. Our analysis focuses on airline service quality. We find that incumbent on-time performance (OTP) actually worsens in response to entry, and even entry threats, by Southwest Airlines. Since Southwest is both a top-performing airline in OTP and a low-cost carrier (LCC), we conjecture that this response by incumbents may be due to a cost-cutting strategy that allows for intense postentry price competition along with preentry deterrence, or it may be due to a postentry differentiation strategy along with preentry accommodation. Further analysis of entry and entry threats by other airlines is inconclusive, providing evidence that is partially consistent with both hypotheses. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of worsening OTP can only be observed when the (potential) entrant is a LCC (Southwest, Jet Blue, and AirTran).

This similarity can result from latent homophily or social influence, as well as common exogenous factors. Latent homophily means consumers who are connected to one another are likely to have similar characteristics and product preferences. Social influence refers to the ability of one consumer to directly influence another consumer's decision based upon their communication. We present an empirical study of purchases of caller ring-back tones using data from an Asian mobile network that predicts consumers' purchase timing and choice decisions. We simultaneously measure latent homophily and social influence, while also accounting for exogenous factors.

Both firms are impatient, and they make alternating offers until an agreement is reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be high or low: the high type's demand is stochastically larger than the low type's. In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an endogenous and type-dependent reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal\u2013agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win\u2013lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.

In practice, sellers tend to offer probabilistic products only after major demand uncertainty has been resolved. By deferring product assignments, a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However, our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer. Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes higher inventory costs (as a result of larger required inventory levels), it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should order less inventory (relative to the case where probabilistic goods are not offered) if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise. Finally, we show that PS, as an inventory-management mechanism, can create a win\u2013win situation, both improving profit and increasing social welfare. This paper was accepted by J.

However, several frictions prevent traders from doing this, including lack of information about prices and difficulty trading across locations. Electronic commerce has the potential to reduce these frictions by increasing price visibility and lowering transaction costs. We analyze this by studying how the diffusion of an electronic channel affected geographic trading patterns and price dispersion in the wholesale used vehicle market from 2003 to 2008. We find that buyers used the channel to shift their demand geographically to exploit price differences, which reduced geographic price dispersion. We find that the electronic channel also influenced how sellers distributed supply, but we find little evidence that this led to reduced geographic price dispersion.

The underlying demand framework combines a general, nonparametric discrete choice model with a Bernoulli process of arrivals over time. The choice model is defined by a discrete probability mass function (pmf) on a set of possible preference rankings of alternatives, and it is compatible with any random utility model. An arriving customer is assumed to purchase the available option that ranks highest in her preference list. The problem we address is how to jointly estimate the arrival rate and the pmf of the rank-based choice model under a maximum likelihood criterion. Since the potential number of customer types is factorial, we propose a market discovery algorithm that starts with a parsimonious set of types and enlarge it by automatically generating new types that increase the likelihood value. Numerical experiments confirm the potential of our proposal. For a realistic data set in the hospitality industry, our approach improves the root mean square errors between predicted and observed purchases computed under independent demand model estimates by 67% to 93%.

In an experimental test of the theory, we systematically change the shape of revealed utility, weighting, and discounting functions by manipulating the distribution of monies, probabilities, and delays in the choices used to elicit them. The data demonstrate that there is no stable mapping between attribute values and their subjective equivalents. Expected and discounted utility theories, and also their descendants such as prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting theory, simply assert stable mappings to describe choice data and offer no account of the instability we find. We explain where the shape of the mapping comes from and, in describing the mechanism by which people choose, explain why the shape depends on the distribution of gains, losses, risks, and delays in the environment.

We adopt a bargaining framework to capture such an assortment selection process. We investigate the properties of the profit allocations that could emerge in a decentralized supply chain. In our model, the retailer engages in simultaneous bilateral negotiations with all manufacturers. Our model and analysis produce managerial insights that could not be obtained in the absence of a bargaining perspective on assortment planning. For example, we find that when a manufacturer improves its product, such improvements not only benefit the retailer but might even benefit competing manufacturers. In fact, even improvements to out-of-assortment products can increase the profits of the retailer and certain in-assortment manufacturers. Hence, our results suggest that a manufacturer can benefit from collaborating with judiciously chosen competitors.

We elicit risk vulnerability by observing each subject's portfolio choice in two different contexts that differ only by the presence or absence of an actuarially neutral background risk. Our main result is that most of the subjects are risk vulnerable: 81% chose a less risky portfolio when exposed to background risk. More precisely, 47% invested a strictly smaller amount in the risky asset, whereas 34% were indifferent.

This has prompted a search for ways to increase Internet adoption and narrow its disparity across countries\u2014the global \u201cdigital divide.\u201d Previous work has focused on demographic, economic, and infrastructure determinants of Internet access that are difficult to change in the short run. Internet content increases adoption and can be changed more quickly; however, the magnitude of its impact, and therefore its effectiveness as a policy and strategy tool, has until now been unknown. Quantifying the role of content is challenging because of feedback (network effects) between content and adoption: more content stimulates adoption, which in turn increases the incentive to create content. We develop a methodology to overcome this endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet content is also useful to effect social change across countries. Content has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation. Our results offer guidance for policymakers on country characteristics that influence adoption's responsiveness to content and for Internet firms on where to expand internationally and how to quantify content investments.

The seller has private information about the product quality, which is unknown to customers in advance and publicly revealed in spot. The question we consider is whether the seller has an incentive to signal quality in advance and, if so, how she can convey a credible signal of product quality. We characterize the seller's signaling strategy and find that rationing of capacity in the advance period is an effective tool of signaling product quality. We find that the high-quality seller can distinguish herself by allocating less capacity than the low-quality seller in the advance period. We show that this signaling mechanism exists whenever advance selling would be optimal for both the high-quality and low-quality sellers if quality were known by the consumers. Interestingly, the seller's ability to ration (rationing flexibility) sometimes disadvantages the seller; this effect is independent of product quality.

Agglomeration economies and the ban on noncompete covenants may influence spinoff entry, but spinoffs promote mobility even in the absence of those conditions.

In modern business and society, there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified, flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with results similar to those achieved by using the original databases. Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases. Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing data-masking methods.

Evidence Based on Their Trading Returns and Social Networks","We study the impact of social networks on the ability of independent directors to obtain private information from their firms' executives. We find that independent directors socially connected to their firms' senior executives earn significantly higher returns than unconnected independent directors in stock sales transactions. The network effect on independent directors' trading profitability is stronger in firms with higher information asymmetry and with more powerful executives. In addition, the trading returns of independent directors previously unconnected with firm executives increase after the arrival of a connected executive and drop after the connected executive leaves the firm. Moreover, the net stock sales by connected directors predict future negative news for up to three quarters.

In this research we study finite mixture specifications for modeling consumer heterogeneity where each regression coefficient has its own finite mixture\u2014that is, an attribute finite mixture model. An important challenge of such an approach to modeling heterogeneity lies in its estimation. A proposed Bayesian estimation approach, based on recent advances in reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, can estimate parameters for the attribute-based finite mixture model, assuming that the number of components for each finite mixture is a discrete random variable. An attribute specification has several advantages over traditional, vector-based, finite mixture specifications; specifically, the attribute mixture model offers a more appropriate aggregation of information than does the vector specification facilitating estimation. In an extensive simulation study and an empirical application, we show that the attribute model can recover complex heterogeneity structures, making it dominant over traditional (vector) finite mixture regression models and a strong contender compared to mixture-of-normals models for modeling heterogeneity.

Video sharing sites, social networks, online games, etc. all rely heavily on user-generated content and have been growing significantly in the last decade. We model a Hotelling style market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes along a circular city. In a first step, we consider two ex ante identical firms whose offerings entirely depend on user-generated content. Consumers contribute content to the firm they join and benefit from the content provided by the others, their valuation being higher the closer the content contributor is to the content consumer (i.e., there are local network effects). In such a setting, we show that ex ante identical firms can acquire differentiated market positions that spontaneously emerge from user-generated content. Moreover, such differentiation may take interesting patterns, wherein a firm simultaneously attracts multiple distinct consumer segments that are isolated from each other. Greater segregation, measured by the number of disjoint segments in each platform, reduces consumer valuation for content, but interestingly, it intensifies firm competition. We show that this insight can help us refine the set of possible equilibria. In a second step, we consider firms that explicitly differentiate their offerings by generating some content on their own. We show that user-generated content may strengthen or defeat firms' intended positioning (i.e., firms attract consumers located opposite to their chosen positions) and consumer surplus may be higher in the latter case. Finally, we allow multihoming by consumers and show that the previous equilibrium patterns remain valid, but in most equilibria, a subset of consumers (located between rival firms' core clienteles) are multihomers. More multihoming consumers imply reduced differentiation and higher degree of platform competition. We relate these findings to anecdotal evidence and explore their strategic implications for competing firms relying on user-generated content. This paper was accepted by J.

Use of all-electric drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives.

We argue that safety tipping points occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82,280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 17% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has important implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity, because it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point. In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40% of the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a hospital system, because it reduces the likelihood that a patient will experience occupancy levels beyond the tipping point. Pooling the capacity of nearby hospitals in our sample reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 34%.

Moderate turbulence reduces the value of flexibility by making supplier selection more difficult and increases the value of commitment by mitigating the status quo bias of integrated structures. Both effects improve the value of integration. Higher levels of turbulence undermine the adaptive benefits of commitment, but have a less adverse effect on flexibility, making nonintegration more attractive.

We study this question in a developing country context (Tanzania), where microenterprises are the source of employment for more than half of the labor force, and we report from a field experiment that jointly investigated the importance of a human capital intervention (business training) and a financial capital intervention (business grant). Using data from three survey rounds, a lab experiment, and administrative records of the microfinance institution, we present evidence on business performance, management practices, happiness, business knowledge, and noncognitive abilities. Our study demonstrates strong effects of the combination of the two interventions on male entrepreneurs, while the effects on female entrepreneurs are much more muted. The results suggest that long-term finance is an important constraint for microfinance entrepreneurs, but that business training is essential to transform financial capital into productive investments.

To address our research question, we use a unique data set containing actual market transaction data for approximately 7,000 pay-per-bid auctions. In contrast with the laboratory experiments of previous related studies, our research presents the unique advantage of investigating the effects of IT-enabled automated bidding agents on the occurrence of a decision bias in real market transactions. We identify normatively irrational decision scenarios and analyze consumer behavior in these situations. Our findings show that participants with a higher behavioral investment are more likely to violate the assumption of normative economic rationality because of the sunk cost effect. More importantly, we observe that the delegation of auction participation, i.e., actual bidding, to IT significantly reduces the occurrence of the sunk cost effect in subsequent decisions made by the same individual. We can attribute this reduction to the comparably lower behavioral investments incurred by auction participants who delegate their bidding to IT. In particular, by mitigating different contributors of behavioral investments, delegating to IT reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of the sunk cost effect by more than 50%.

In the model, creditors, who learn information from stock prices, will grow increasingly unsure about the bank's true fundamentals in facing noisier stock prices; thus a run on the bank is more likely because of creditors' concave payoff. Understanding this, speculators conduct short selling beforehand to amplify (il)liquidity and add noise to stock prices, triggering a bank run, and subsequently profit from the bank's failure. We show that short-selling attacks on a bank involve two runs: the aggressive run among speculators and the conservative run among creditors. These two runs interact and reinforce each other, with compound feedback loops that drastically increase the probability of the collapse of the bank. We discuss policy implications of the model.

Advertisers join these markets with a prespecified budget and participate in multiple second-price auctions over the length of a campaign. This paper studies the competitive landscape that arises in ad exchanges and the implications for publishers\u2019 decisions. The presence of budgets introduces dynamic interactions among advertisers that need to be taken into account when attempting to characterize the bidding landscape or the impact of changes in the auction design. To this end, we introduce the notion of a fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) that is behaviorally appealing and computationally tractable, and in some important cases, it yields a closed-form characterization. We establish that an FMFE approximates well the rational behavior of advertisers in these markets. We then show how this framework may be used to provide sharp prescriptions for key auction design decisions that publishers face in these markets. In particular, we show that ignoring budgets, a common practice in this literature, can result in significant profit losses for the publisher when setting the reserve price.

The seller\u2019s objective is to adjust prices in each period so as to maximize cumulative expected revenues over a given finite time horizon; in doing so, the seller needs to resolve the tension between learning the unknown demand curve and maximizing earned revenues. The main question that we investigate is the following: How large of a revenue loss is incurred if the seller uses a simple parametric model that differs significantly (i.e., is misspecified) relative to the underlying demand curve? We measure performance by analyzing the price trajectory induced by this misspecified model and quantifying the magnitude of revenue losses (as a function of the time horizon) relative to an oracle that knows the true underlying demand curve. The \u201cprice of misspecification\u201d is expected to be significant if the parametric model is overly restrictive.

Buyers generally exercise their option to bargain according to their equilibrium strategy, but their take-it-or-leave-it offers vary positively with auction prices when they should be invariant.

However, no study so far has evaluated the aggregate market impact of these effects across different brand development strategies or accounted for the strategic decision to introduce the extension. It is important to examine the above given the significant investments and the high failure rates associated with the introduction of new product extensions. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that derives revenue outcome due to an extension introduction as a function of spillover and extension effects. We empirically estimate the above effects through a Bayesian endogenous switching model that jointly models market shares of the extension and its parent brand along with the strategic decision to introduce the extension and the endogeneity in prices. By using a data set that covers 155 extensions introduced across 20 U.S. geographic markets, we obtain several new generalizable empirical insights. Our results show that spillover effects are higher for brand extensions, whereas line extensions benefit through larger extension effects. We find that vertically differentiating a line extension in terms of increased quality mitigates its negative spillover effects. The addition of a new brand name (i.e., sub-branding) lowers spillover effects for line extensions, whereas it increases the market performance for brand extensions. Our findings provide several strategic implications for manufacturers to successfully introduce and manage product extensions.

In such a setting, does the buyer benefit from engaging the services of a better-informed procurement service provider (PSP) compared to procuring directly from the suppliers? Intuition might suggest that hiring a PSP is always the right choice because the PSP\u2019s knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management. On the other hand, earlier studies prove that using a PSP purely for its superior knowledge about supply costs is always worse for a buyer than contracting with the suppliers directly. Our answer to this research question is more nuanced. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies, we find that the buyer may benefit from using a PSP. We identify, quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs of using a PSP, and describe conditions under which the benefits exceed the costs. The benefits of using a PSP are derived when one supplier is of high reliability and the other is of low reliability, from a reduction of informational costs due to implicit supplier collusion facilitated by the PSP and an improvement of supply availability. The costs of using a PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the loss of direct control over the supplier\u2019s production actions, which leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs, and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion. Comparative statics analysis indicates that using the PSP is valuable only if the buyer diversifies with some supplier-type combinations but not others, and that hiring a PSP is not a solution to the problem of an unreliable supply base.

Yet controversies exist over the influence of copyright protection on firm profitability. The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative rationale for the growing anti-protection trend and to investigate optimal copyright enforcement and quality provision in a monopoly setting. The proposed economic mechanism centers on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when consumers can get to know the firm\u2019s actions (e.g., price, quality) only after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus, thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower quality as copyright enforcement increases. Interestingly, quality unobservability can moderate this strategic effect and thus lead to an increasing incentive for copyright protection.

We then generalize the dynamic model to account for uncertainty in the outcomes of the interdiction actions.

We analyze what determines whether or not a CEO receives separation pay in excess of the amount specified in the severance contract. We find that discretionary separation pay is given to about 40% of departing CEOs and is, on average, $8 million, which amounts to close to 242% of a CEO\u2019s annual compensation. We investigate the determinants of discretionary separation pay and find, for example, that discretionary separation pay positively correlates with weak internal governance in cases of voluntary CEO turnover but not when the CEO is forced out. We also find that discretionary pay is higher when the CEO has a noncompete clause in her ex ante severance contract. Event study analysis suggests that shareholders benefit from discretionary separation pay in forced turnovers but not in voluntary ones.

Although traditional theories of global sourcing focus on lowering costs, we argue that as high-performing firms seek to develop new capabilities by tapping into foreign knowledge, they will increasingly turn to offshore integration to reap colocation benefits and overcome expropriation challenges. By contrast, offshore outsourcing will be preferred by less profitable firms seeking to tap into low-cost inputs, especially as investments in information technology lower monitoring costs. Empirical analysis of a comprehensive panel of cross-border product transfers by U.S. manufacturing multinational corporations from 1989 to 2004 reveals support for these arguments.

Sensitivity to gain-loss ratio provides an alternative account for several existing findings and implies a number of novel predictions. It implies greater sensitivity to losses and risk aversion when expected value is positive, but greater sensitivity to gains and risk seeking when expected value is negative. It also implies more extreme preferences when expected value is positive than when expected value is negative.

The observed behavior is generally consistent with moderate risk aversion and a median (mean) RRA close to one (three).

We compare the performance of this mechanism with the standard low price mechanism to determine how successful the average bid format is in preventing bidder losses as well as its impact on the price paid by the buyer. We find the average bid mechanism to be more successful than expected because, surprisingly, bidding behavior remains similar between the average bid and low price auctions.

Thus, the question arises: When a retailer bids higher to attract more customers, should the accompanying price also decrease (to strengthen the bid's effect on demand) or increase (to take advantage of higher willingness to pay)? We find that the answer depends on how fast the retailer increases its bid. In particular, as the end of the season approaches, the optimal bid exhibits smooth increases followed by big jumps.

We report on laboratory experiments that identify causal factors determining the willingness of buyers to pay voluntarily under PWYW. Furthermore, to see how competition affects the viability of PWYW, we implement markets in which a PWYW seller competes with a traditional seller. Finally, we endogenize the market structure and let sellers choose their pricing strategy. The experimental results show that outcome-based social preferences and strategic considerations to keep the seller in the market can explain why and how much buyers pay voluntarily to a PWYW seller. We find that PWYW can be viable on a monopolistic market, but it is less successful as a competitive strategy because it does not drive traditional posted-price sellers out of the market. Instead, the existence of a posted-price competitor reduces buyers' payments and prevents the PWYW seller from fully penetrating the market. When given the choice, most sellers opt for setting a posted price rather than a PWYW pricing strategy. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of PWYW as a marketing strategy.

We focus on (1) treatment of compound risks relative to simple risks and (2) the relationship between compound risk attitudes and ambiguity attitudes. We find that compound risks are valued differently than corresponding reduced simple risks. These differences measure compound risk attitudes. These attitudes display more aversion as the reduced probability of the winning event increases. Like Halevy [Halevy Y (2007) Ellsberg revisited: An experimental study. Econometrica 75:503\u2013536], we find an association between compound risk reduction and ambiguity neutrality. However, in contrast to the almost perfect identification in Halevy\u2019s data, we find a substantially weaker relation in both directions. First, a majority of our ambiguity-neutral subjects fail to reduce compound risk. Second, almost a quarter of our subjects who reduce compound risk are nonneutral to ambiguity.

We find that although brand licensing announcements lead to positive abnormal returns on average, nearly 44% of the announcements in our sample are followed by negative abnormal returns. We argue that investors react more favorably to a brand licensing announcement when they believe (i) the brand has greater ability to stimulate licensee product sales (and thus generate higher royalties for the licensor) and (ii) the licensor firm has greater ability to limit licensee opportunism (and thus limit brand dilution and its adverse effect on sales of other products marketed under the brand name). In line with our hypotheses related to a brand's ability to stimulate licensee product sales, the study's findings suggest that investors react more favorably to announcements involving brands with greater brand fit and greater brand breadth. However, investors appear to react less favorably to announcements involving brands with higher advertising investments. In line with our hypotheses related to a licensor firm's ability to limit licensee opportunism, the study's findings suggest that investors react more favorably to announcements involving larger licensors; however, investors' reactions do not appear to be influenced by licensor firms' licensing experience.

This reduction in bidders\u2019 search costs has important effects on bidders\u2019 participation patterns and sellers\u2019 revenue. The \u201cdemand expansion\u201d effect occurs when reduced search costs allow bidders to participate in more auctions. The \u201cdemand distribution\u201d effect occurs when reduced search costs allow bidders to distribute themselves more evenly across auctions.

We apply our analytical insights to 65,718 sequential auctions (comprising over 10 million vehicles) in the wholesale used vehicle market. We show that reduced search costs can increase seller revenue by smoothing the distribution of bidder participation across auctions, even if the aggregate amount of bidder participation remains constant.

Because the pairing of a star and a movie involves a bilateral matching process between the studio and the star, the star (hence the nonstar) movie samples are nonrandom and the star variable is potentially endogenous. To assess the star as well as movie characteristics effects, we utilize a switching model to account for endogenous assignment of stars and nonstars into respective movie samples. In addition to controlling for selection biases, the endogenous switching model generates managerially relevant insights into the factors that influence a star's assignment to a movie. Additionally, because the star and nonstar movie characteristics (e.g., movie budget, distribution, genre, etc.) are often systematically different, we counterfactually estimate the theater allocations and revenues that nonstars (stars) would have generated had they acted in movies endowed with the same characteristics as the star (nonstar) movies. The decomposition analysis, conducted at different quantiles of theater and revenue distributions, shows that the presence of a star has a much stronger effect on theater allocations than the movie characteristics have. However, the revenue difference is entirely contributed by the differences in the characteristics of the star and nonstar movies. Thus, the star effects on revenue come indirectly through the theater allocations as well as from the characteristics of the movies in which they participate.

A practically implementable policy for such a firm is a tailored base-surge (TBS) policy [Allon G, Van Mieghem JA (2010) Global dual sourcing: Tailored base-surge allocation to near- and offshore production. Management Sci. 56(1):110\u2013124] to manage its inventory. Under this policy, the firm procures a constant quantity from the regular supplier in every period and dynamically makes procurement decisions for the emergency supplier. Allon and Van Mieghem describe this practice as using the regular supplier to meet a base level of demand and the emergency supplier to manage demand surges, and they conjecture that this practice is most effective when the lead time difference between the two suppliers is large. We confirm these statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result: when demand is composed of a base demand random component plus a surge demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability, the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances. The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery) to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.

The analysis is based on a sample of 681 SCOME appointments that were publicly announced during the 2000\u20132011 period. We find that the stock market reaction is positive on the day of the announcement. Categorizing the SCOME appointments as new or old and insider or outsider, we find that the market reaction for newly created SCOME positions is positive. The market also reacts more positively when a SCOME is an outsider rather than an insider. The strongest positive reaction is observed when outsiders are hired for newly created SCOME positions. We find evidence of both poor stock price performance and poor operating performance in the period preceding the appointment of new SCOMEs. New SCOME appointments are not followed by an immediate improvement in stock price and operating performance. However, there is no further decline in performance, suggesting that the decline observed in the preappointment period does not continue after the new SCOME is appointed. We also find that the likelihood of a SCOME being an outsider is greater for firms that are smaller, operate in more concentrated industries, and have experienced poor prior performance.

We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: the number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments.

We consider a canonical model of dynamic advance scheduling with two patient classes: an urgent demand class, which must be served on the day of arrival, and a regular demand class, which can be served at a future date. Patients take the earliest appointments offered and do not differentiate among providers. We derive a surprising characterization of an optimal policy and an algorithm to compute the policy exactly and efficiently. These are, to our knowledge, the first analytical results for the dynamic advance assignment of patients to exam days.

Such markets typically lead to computationally hard allocation problems. Our new framework consists of compact bid languages for sealed-bid auctions and methods to compute second-price rules such as the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves or bidder-optimal, core-selecting payment rules when the optimality of the allocation problem cannot be guaranteed. To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for a specific, complex market, we introduce a compact bidding language for TV advertising markets and investigate the resulting winner-determination problem and the computation of core payments. For realistic instances of the respective winner-determination problems, very good solutions with a small integrality gap can be found quickly, although closing the integrality gap to find marginally better solutions or prove optimality can take a prohibitively large amount of time. Our subsequent adaptation of a constraint-generation technique for the computation of bidder-optimal core payments to this environment is a practically viable paradigm by which core-selecting auction designs can be applied to large markets with potentially hundreds of items. Such auction designs allow bidders to express their preferences with a low number of parameters, while at the same time providing incentives for truthful bidding. We complement our computational experiments in the context of TV advertising markets with additional results for volume discount auctions in procurement to illustrate the applicability of the approach in different types of large markets.

Our experiment broadly corroborates the price and choice predictions of the theory. However, price quality deteriorates when only a few managers attract most of the available wealth.

Knowledge about the extent and determinants of reciprocal effort choices is, however, incomplete. We investigate the role of fairness perceptions and social preferences in a field experiment in which workers were hired for a one-time job. We show that workers who perceive being underpaid at the base wage increase their performance if the hourly wage increases, whereas those who feel adequately paid or overpaid at the base wage do not change their performance. Moreover, we find that only the workers who display reciprocity in a choice experiment show reciprocal effort responses in the field. The workers who lack reciprocity in the choice experiment do not respond to the wage increase, even if they feel underpaid at the base wage. Our findings suggest that fairness perceptions and social preferences are key in workers' performance response to wage increases. In our study, the wage increase affects effort mainly through the removal of perceived unfairness, i.e., the elimination of negative reciprocity toward the firm, rather than positive reciprocity. These results are the first direct evidence of the fair-wage effort hypothesis in the field and also help interpret previous contradictory findings in the literature.

This is an important new dimension of inquiry because of the widespread prevalence of quality-differentiated markets as well as significant differences in the preference structure across these markets. In fact, this latter consideration casts doubt as to whether probabilistic selling will even emerge in quality-differentiated markets. We find that probabilistic selling emerges in quality-differentiated markets as a way to profitably dispose excess capacity; moreover, probabilistic selling remains viable even under endogenous quality choice. In addition, in markets where sellers employ \u201cstrong\u201d quality differentiation, the introduction of an intermediate probabilistic good actually causes closer quality levels in a product line and enhances consumer welfare. In contrast, in markets where sellers employ \u201cweak\u201d quality differentiation, the introduction of an intermediate probabilistic good increases quality separation and degrades consumer welfare.

We demonstrate that nonparticipating, observing consumers prefer to buy from user- rather than designer-driven firms because of an enhanced identification with the firm that has adopted this user-driven philosophy. Three experimental studies validate a newly proposed social identification account underlying this effect. Because consumers are also users, their social identities connect to the user-designers, and they feel empowerment by vicariously being involved in the design process. This formed connection leads to preference for the firm\u2019s products. Importantly, this social identification account also effectively predicts when the effect does not materialize. First, we find that if consumers feel dissimilar to participating users, the effects are attenuated. We demonstrate that this happens when the community differs from consumers along important demographics (i.e., gender) or when consumers are nonexperts in the focal domain (i.e., they feel that they do not belong to the social group of participating users). Second, the effects are attenuated if the user-driven firm is only selectively rather than fully open to participation from all users (observing consumers do not feel socially included). These findings advance the emerging theory on user involvement and offer practical implications for firms interested in pursuing a user-driven philosophy.

We develop a game theoretic model to investigate how these insights are affected when the vendor is privately informed about the reliability of a newly developed product. A novel feature of our model is the interaction between reliability signaling (private information) and the vendor\u2019s discretionary investment in spares inventory (private action), which arises naturally in the setting we consider. We find that this interaction leads to contrasting equilibrium outcomes under the two contracts: RBC induces the vendor to focus on inventory savings, leading to underinvestment in spares, whereas PBC induces the vendor to focus on reliability signaling, achieved through overinvestment in inventory. As a result, neither contract is efficient. We investigate two means to mitigate this inefficiency, but either approach has caveats: (a) making inventory verifiable removes the trade-off between reliability signaling and inventory investment, but results in diverging contract preferences between the vendor and the buyer; (b) pooling inventories across multiple buyers saves inventory costs but it also hinders reliability signaling, potentially exacerbating inefficiency.

Under bank financing, a debt-type contract emerges as optimal, which allows the entrepreneur to retain full control of the venture and thus yields strong effort incentives, as long as the entrepreneur can service the debt repayment; however, this leads to liquidation in the case of default, making the venture\u2019s success quite sensitive to exogenous, even temporary, shocks that may hinder debt repayment. Under VC financing, an equity-type contract emerges as optimal. Although it is not sensitive to exogenous shocks, this contract requires the entrepreneur to share a fraction of the rents with the financier, thus yielding lower effort incentives for the entrepreneur. There exists a threshold level of venture risk such that bank financing is optimal if and only if venture risk is below that threshold. Product market competition increases the value of stronger entrepreneurial incentives and thus increases the maximum level of risk the entrepreneur is willing to take before switching from bank financing to VC financing. This is a robust result that is shown to hold in various models of competition, including the Hotelling, Salop, Dixit\u2013Stiglitz, and Cournot-to-Bertrand switch.

A Randomized Field Experiment on Peer Influence in Online Social Networks","Demonstrating compelling causal evidence of the existence and strength of peer-to-peer influence has become the holy grail of modern research in online social networks. In these networks, it has been consistently demonstrated that user characteristics and behavior tend to cluster both in space and in time. There are multiple well-known rival mechanisms that compete to be the explanation for this observed clustering. These range from peer influence to homophily to other unobservable external stimuli. These multiple mechanisms lead to similar observational data, yet have vastly different policy implications. In this paper, we present a novel randomized experiment that tests the existence of causal peer influence in the general population\u2014one that did not involve subject recruitment for experimentation\u2014of a particular large-scale online social network. We utilize a unique social feature to exogenously induce adoption of a paid service among a group of randomly selected users, and in the process develop a clean exogenous randomization of treatment and control groups. A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference to ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival models, yield close to identical, statistically and economically significant estimates of peer influence in the general population of a freemium social network. Our estimates show that peer influence causes more than a 60% increase in odds of buying the service due to the influence coming from an adopting friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller number of friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the users with a larger number of friends. Our nonparametric resampling procedure-based estimates are helpful in situations of networked data that violate independence assumptions. We establish that peer influence is a powerful force in getting users from free to premium levels, a known challenge in freemium communities.

How much (if any) pricing discretion headquarters should grant is a topic of debate within many firms. We investigate this issue using a unique data set from an indirect lender with local pricing discretion. We estimate that the local sales force adjusted prices in a way that improved profits by approximately 11% on average. A counterfactual analysis shows that using a centralized, data-driven pricing optimization system could improve profits even further, up to 20% over those actually realized. This suggests that centralized pricing\u2014if appropriately optimized\u2014can be more effective than field price discretion.

We found that introducing a video resulted in a 14.5% increase in apparel sales and a 28.3% increase in accessories sales. The estimated increase in accessories sales was largely attributed to the spillover effect of videos.

I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony, reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500 and find support for all three.

Although the dynamic strategy is able to benefit from predictability out-of-sample, a short-term investor using a single-period market timing strategy would have realized an almost identical performance. The value of intertemporal hedge demands in strategic asset allocation appears negligible. The result is caused by the estimation error in predicting the predictors. A myopic investor only needs to predict one-period-ahead expected returns, but hedge demands also require accurate predictions of the predictor variables. To reduce the problem of errors in optimized portfolio weights, we consider Bayesian procedures.

This case is realistic because central banks are typically less than perfectly open about their intentions. Accordingly, surveys of economists reveal that they frequently disagree in their expectations. Under heterogeneity in beliefs, investors place speculative bets against each other on the evolution of the money supply, and as a result the sharing of wealth in the economy evolves stochastically. Employing a continuous-time equilibrium model, we show that these fluctuations majorly affect the prices of all assets, as well as inflation. Our model could help explain some empirical puzzles. In particular, we find that the volatility of bond yields and stock market volatility could be significantly increased by the heterogeneity in beliefs, a conclusion supported by our empirical analyses.

Local sourcing is receiving more attention, but it remains challenging to balance the offshore sourcing cost advantage against the increased inventories, because of its longer lead time, and against the cost and (volume) flexibility of each source\u2019s capacity. To guide strategic allocation in this global network decision, this paper establishes reasonably simple prescriptions that capture the key drivers. We adopt a conventional discrete-time inventory model with a linear control rule that smoothes orders and allows an exact and analytically tractable analysis of single- and dual-sourcing policies under normal demand. Distinguishing features of our model are that it captures each source\u2019s lead time, capacity cost, and flexibility to work overtime. We use Lagrange\u2019s inversion theorem to provide exact and simple square-root bound formulae for the strategic sourcing allocations and the value of dual sourcing. The formulae provide structural insight on the impact of financial, operational, and demand parameters, and a starting point for quantitative decision making. We investigate the robustness of our results by comparing the smoothing policy with existing single- and dual-sourcing models in a simulation study that relaxes model assumptions.

Evidence from a Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment","One explanation advanced for the persistent gender pay differences in labor markets is that women avoid salary negotiations. By using a natural field experiment that randomizes nearly 2,500 job seekers into jobs that vary important details of the labor contract, we are able to observe both the extent of salary negotiations and the nature of sorting. We find that when there is no explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate for a higher wage, whereas women are more likely to signal their willingness to work for a lower wage. However, when we explicitly mention the possibility that wages are negotiable, these differences disappear completely. In terms of sorting, we find that men, in contrast to women, prefer job environments where the \u201crules of wage determination\u201d are ambiguous. This leads to the gender gap being much more pronounced in jobs that leave negotiation of wage ambiguous. This paper was accepted by G\u00e9rard P.

We consider a seller who can offer a single product to consumers twice, in advance and in spot. Consumers choose whether and when to buy, but if they buy in advance, they are uncertain about their own valuations. Whether they buy in advance or in spot, consumers\u2019 valuations are realized in the spot period and they may range from fully independent to perfectly correlated, creating markets with different characteristics of aggregate demand for the seller. Facing these consumers, the seller chooses a portion of the total capacity to offer in advance and prices in both periods. We describe how the optimal strategy and benefits of advance selling depend on the interdependence of consumer valuation, as well as capacity level and other market parameters. We find that a change in valuation interdependence can lead to dramatically different policies for the seller. For example, when individual valuations are highly diverse and the consumer population is large, the seller must offer a discount during advance selling but may limit the advance sales. On the other hand, when valuations are highly correlated, the seller can charge a premium price during advance selling. For the same valuation interdependence, the qualitative nature of the optimal strategy changes with available capacity.

This paper presents empirical tests of this policy using aggregate, firm-level data. First, we extend a single-item adaptive base stock policy in previous literature to a multi-item case. Second, we transform the policy derived for the multi-item case to a regression model that relates firm-level inventory purchases to firm-level sales and changes in sales forecasts. We focus on two research questions: Can the adaptive base stock policy explain cross-sectional ordering behaviors under sales growth? To the extent that the adaptive base stock policy fails to explain ordering behaviors under sales growth, are there frictions that explain such a finding? Our empirical results demonstrate disparities in ordering behaviors between firms experiencing high and moderate sales growth. Contrary to theoretical prediction, this implies that inventory purchases are a function of not only current sales and changes in sales forecast but also past sales growth. As potential explanations for this departure from theoretical prediction, we show that both future demand dynamics and inventory holding risks depend on past sales growth. In addition, we find that firms' inventory holding risks may also be affected by purchasing constraints imposed by supply chain contracts. Our results provide managerial implications for practitioners and inform future theoretical research.

Prior research on branding and brand extension has primarily focused on how branding influences consumers\u2019 perceptions of product quality. However, consumers of conspicuous goods care not only about product quality but also about the profile of its users. For example, high-end consumers prefer an exclusive brand. On the other hand, low-end consumers may find a brand more attractive if high-end consumers use it. In this paper, we analyze how social effects and market structure can influence the branding of conspicuous goods. Consistent with intuition, our theoretical analysis shows that a monopolist would prefer not to use umbrella branding when consumers\u2019 desire for uniqueness is high. By contrast, in a competitive market, umbrella branding is more profitable than individual branding when consumers have a high level of desire for uniqueness. We also identify conditions in which it is optimal for marketers of conspicuous goods to adopt either an individual branding strategy or asymmetric branding strategies. Furthermore, competing firms may offer umbrella branding even when both firms may be better off if they could commit to using individual branding. Finally, we extend the model to consider a market where consumers\u2019 product preference is not related to social status. Again, if consumers are sufficiently snobbish, competing firms earn more profits by adopting an umbrella branding strategy instead of an individual branding strategy. This paper was accepted by J.

Information Cascades in Online Movie Ratings","Online product ratings are widely available on the Internet and are known to influence prospective buyers. An emerging literature has started to look at how ratings are generated and, in particular, how they are influenced by prior ratings. We study the social influence of prior ratings and, in particular, investigate any differential impact of prior ratings by strangers (\u201ccrowd\u201d) versus friends. We find evidence of both herding and differentiation behavior in crowd ratings wherein users\u2019 ratings are influenced positively or negatively by prior ratings depending on movie popularity. In contrast, friends\u2019 ratings always induce herding. Further, the presence of social networking reduces the likelihood of herding on prior ratings by the crowd.

In such cases, information sharing among the different units is critical, but it cannot be taken for granted. Instead, individual units need to be incentivized to not only exert effort in evaluating their projects, but also to truthfully reveal their findings. The former requires an emphasis on individual performance, whereas the latter relies on the existence of a common goal across the organization. Motivated by this commonly observed tension, we address the following question: How should a firm balance individual and shared incentives, so that vital information is both acquired, and equally importantly, disseminated to the entire organization? Our model captures two key characteristics of R&D experimentation: information is imperfect and it is also costly. Our analysis yields several important implications for the design of such incentive schemes and the management of R&D portfolios.

The effects hold for both chronic and manipulated levels of perceived self-control and are observed only for risks involving high personal agency (e.g., overeating, smoking, drinking). As an important implication of our results, we also demonstrate that those lower (higher) in self-control show relatively less (more) interest in products and lifestyle changes reducing consequences (e.g., a pill that heals liver damage from drinking) than those reducing likelihood of risks (e.g., a pill that prevents liver damage from drinking).

The Role of Preferences and Context in Shaping Different Entrepreneurial Interests","Entrepreneurial ventures rely not only on founders but also on \u201cjoiners\u201d\u2014start-up employees who are attracted to entrepreneurship, but who do not want to be founders themselves. Drawing on both preference and contextual theories of entrepreneurship, we examine how individuals\u2019 interest in being a founder, a joiner, or neither forms prior to the first career transition. We find that although individuals with founder and joiner interests share similar preferences for entrepreneurial job attributes such as autonomy and risk, their preferences for these attributes also differ in significantly meaningful ways. Contextual factors such as norms, role models, and opportunities exhibit very different relationships with founder and joiner interests. Most interestingly, our results suggest that preferences and context interrelate in unique ways to shape different entrepreneurial interests. In particular, an interest in being a founder is most strongly associated with individuals\u2019 preferences for entrepreneurial job attributes, whereas contextual factors do little to shape a founder interest in individuals who lack these preferences. An interest in being a joiner, on the other hand, is associated with both preferences and context, and this relationship is most pronounced for individuals with preferences that predispose them toward entrepreneurship. This study highlights joiners as a distinct type of entrepreneurial actor and demonstrates the importance of considering the interplay between preferences and context in the study of entrepreneurship.

Collaboration imposes constraints on the capacity of the process because multitasking resources have to be simultaneously at the right place. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable bottleneck idleness to study the maximal throughput or capacity of such networks. Collaboration and multitasking introduce synchronization requirements that may inflict unavoidable idleness of the bottleneck resources: even when the network is continuously busy (processing at capacity), bottleneck resources can never be fully utilized. The conventional approach that equates network capacity with bottleneck capacity is then incorrect because the network capacity is below that of the bottlenecks. In fact, the gap between the two can grow linearly with the number of collaborative activities. Our main result is that networks with nested collaboration architectures have no unavoidable bottleneck idleness. Then, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, the standard bottleneck procedure correctly identifies the network capacity. We also prove necessity in the sense that, for any nonnested architecture, there are values of processing times for which unavoidable idleness persists. The fundamental trade-off between collaboration and capacity does not disappear in multiserver networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. Yet, even in multiserver networks, a nested collaboration architecture still guarantees that the bottleneck capacity is achievable. Finally, simultaneous collaboration, as a process constraint, may limit the benefits of flexibility. We study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architectures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0498","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of collaboration and multitasking in operational networks without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider a model in which a retail firm announces a pair of declining prices for two selling periods, and customers with heterogeneous valuations each decide whether to buy a unit early, later or never. In this model, if the demand function is linear and its parameters are common knowledge, there never exist any markdown prices that achieve temporal discrimination for any feasible model parameters. Either all buying customers wait, or all buy early. By contrast, if the demand level is unknown, there always exists a temporally discriminating markdown pricing scheme for all feasible model parameters. We derive qualitative insights to the way demand uncertainty and Bayesian updating contribute to temporal discrimination, which broadly apply to nonlinear demand functions as well. We also show that in case of demand uncertainty, there always exists a temporally discriminating pricing scheme that yields a strictly higher profit to the retailer than the optimal static pricing scheme. Ironically, however, the retailer cannot implement the optimal scheme due to the same demand uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0499","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategy and demand uncertainty without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These warranties are priced to cover the cost of high-usage customers who have more failures and are willing to pay a risk premium for their risk aversion. That makes traditional warranties economically unattractive to low-usage customers and those who are less risk averse. These issues can be addressed by residual value warranties, which refund part of the up-front price to customers who have zero or few claims according to a predetermined refund schedule.

Specifically, we consider a firm that must choose capacities of resources that will be used to satisfy stochastic demand for multiple products, where demands follow a multivariate normal distribution. Prior to the capacity decision, the firm receives information revealing either the total volume of demand across products or the mix of demand between products. We examine two different scenarios: a dedicated resource setting with product-specific resources and a common resource scenario with one flexible resource. For both scenarios we derive the distribution of the (possibly imperfect) volume or mix demand signal, as well as the conditional distributions of demand given the particular signal. We explore the impact of either type of information on optimal capacities and profit. We find that commonality and volume information are strategic complements\u2014so that it is more valuable to obtain volume information in settings with a common resource. On the other hand, commonality and mix information are strategic substitutes. Moreover, we find that mix and volume information themselves are complements in systems with dedicated resources. Having either type of information is valuable in reducing uncertainty for each individual product demand, but having both of them together provides information on two different dimensions, allowing for a much greater reduction in demand uncertainty. In systems with a common resource, however, the two types of information are substitutes. Because volume information is well aligned with commonality (both focus on total demand), such information already provides much of the value that can be obtained\u2014having mix information adds limited additional value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0502","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand information and resource allocation without any reference to social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

In this paper, we study the impact of two major barriers to mass adoption of EVs: (i) range anxiety, the concern that the driving range of EVs may be insufficient to meet the driving needs, and (ii) resale anxiety, the concern that used values of EVs may deteriorate quickly. Using a stylized model calibrated to a data set based on the San Francisco Bay Area, we show that although both types of consumer anxieties typically harm the firm\u2019s profit, they often improve consumer surplus. In addition, we show that a business model that requires consumers to lease the EV batteries (rather than purchase them) may lead to a greater level of adoption and emission savings when the level of resale anxiety is high. Further, a business model that offers EV range improvement through enhanced charging infrastructure typically yields greater adoption and consumer surplus, but lowers the firm\u2019s profit, compared with one that offers enlarged batteries. Overall, we find that the combinations of battery owning/leasing with enhanced charging service, referred to as the (O, E) and (L, E) models in our paper, typically yield the best balance among the objectives of EV adoption, emission savings, profitability, and consumer surplus, when the degree of resale anxiety is low and high, respectively.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0504","","MSOM","Operations Management","4","['emission savings', 'consumer surplus', 'business model']","The article discusses the impact of electric vehicles on consumer behavior and emphasizes emission savings, which aligns with sustainability themes.

To do this entails the management of a distribution network with more decision options than a traditional retailer. The online retailer, not the customer, decides from where items will ship, by what shipping method, and how or whether multiple-item orders will be broken up into multiple shipments. What is the best way to fulfill each customer\u2019s order to minimize average outbound shipping cost? We partner with an online retailer to examine this question. We develop a heuristic that makes fulfillment decisions by minimizing the immediate outbound shipping cost plus an estimate of future expected outbound shipping costs. These estimates are derived from the dual values of a transportation linear program (LP). In our experiments on industry data, we capture 36% of the opportunity gap assuming clairvoyance, leading to reductions in outbound shipping costs on the order of 1%. These cost savings are achieved without any deterioration in customer service levels or any increase in holding costs. The transportation LP also serves as the basis for a metric that provides information on the quality of the inventory position. Based on initial successful piloting, our industrial partner has implemented the metric as well as a version of the heuristic that it is applying to every fulfillment decision for each of its stock keeping units in North America.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0505","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fulfillment decisions and cost minimization in online retail without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By expediting open orders, back orders can be reduced. Order expediting is costly, and we include various types of expediting costs in the model. We prove structural properties of the model and show how the optimal parameters of the expediting policy can be computed efficiently. The expediting policy is easy to implement and, for situations with variable expediting cost only, the structure of the policy is optimal. For situations with nonvariable expediting costs, the expediting policy that we consider is generally not optimal. The optimal policy can be computed by dynamic programming, but this approach is computationally feasible only for small-problem instances. We conduct numerical experiments that are based on data from the service division of a global equipment manufacturer to evaluate the performances of the expediting policy and the optimal policy. The results show that substantial cost savings can be achieved by order expediting and that the expediting policy realizes a great share of the cost-saving potential offered by order expediting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0506","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost savings without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for wokeness."],["2015","17","1","John R.

Our focus is on using information on orders in the replenishment pipeline, i.e., pipeline information, to achieve cost-efficient policies for requesting emergency shipments.

The goal is to determine how long one should wait for stock in the replenishment pipeline before requesting an emergency shipment, and the cost effects of using pipeline information in this manner. The analysis utilizes results from queuing theory and provides a decomposition technique for optimizing the policy parameters that reduces the complex multiechelon problem to more manageable single-echelon problems.

Because of the complexity of the diagnostic technology, EID programs are often highly centralized with few laboratories testing blood samples from a large network of health facilities. This leads to long diagnostic delays and consequent failure of patients to collect results in a timely manner. Several point-of-care (POC) devices that provide rapid diagnosis within the health facilities are being developed to mitigate these drawbacks of centralized EID networks. We study the decision of which facilities should receive the POC device (the placement plan) using the EID program in Mozambique as a case study. We argue that the choice of an appropriate plan is critical to maximizing the public health impact of POC devices in the presence of tight budget constraints. To formalize this argument, we develop a detailed simulation model to evaluate the impact of a placement plan. It comprises two parts: an operational model that quantifies the impact of a POC placement plan on the diagnostic delay and a behavioral part that quantifies the impact of diagnostic delay on the likelihood of result collection by infants\u2019 caregivers. We also develop an approximate version of these operational and patient behavior dynamics and embed them in an optimization model to generate candidate POC placement plans. We find that the optimization-based plan can result in up to 30% more patients collecting their results compared to rules of thumb that have practical appeal. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of POC devices is much higher than other operational improvements to the EID network such as increased laboratory capacity, reduced transportation delay, and more regularized transport.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0512","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['public health', 'resource-limited', 'diagnostic delay', 'POC devices']","The article addresses public health impacts in resource-limited settings, emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis for infants affected by HIV.

Specifically, we consider a generalized version of the well-known \u201cselling-to-the-newsvendor\u201d model in which both the upstream and the downstream firms face stochastic input costs. The firms\u2019 operations are intertwined\u2014i.e., the downstream buyer depends on the upstream supplier for delivery and the supplier depends on the buyer for purchase. We show that if left unmanaged, the stochastic costs that reverberate through the supply chain can lead to significant financial losses. The situation could deteriorate to the point of a supply disruption if at least one of the supply chain members cannot profitably make its product. To the extent that hedging can ensure continuation in supply, hedging can have value to at least some of the members of the supply chain. We identify conditions under which the risk of the supply chain breakdown will cause the supply chain members to hedge their input costs: (i) the downstream buyer\u2019s market power exceeds a critical threshold; or (ii) the upstream firm operates on a large margin, there is a high baseline demand for downstream firm\u2019s final product, and the downstream firm\u2019s market power is below a critical threshold. In absence of these conditions there are equilibria in which neither firm hedges. To sustain hedging in equilibrium, both firms must hedge and supply chain breakdown must be costly. The equilibrium hedging policy will (in general) be a partial hedging policy. There are also situations when firms hedge in equilibrium although hedging reduces their expected payoff.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0514","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and risk mitigation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The hospital administrator decides on the number of wings to form, the number of beds to allocate to each wing, and the set of care types to assign to each wing to maximize the total utility to the hospital. The administrator faces an inherent trade-off between forming large wings to pool demand and bed capacity, and forming specialized wings to focus on narrow ranges of care types. Specialized wings not only provide advantages from focused care but also allow the protection of beds for high-utility care types. We provide an optimization model for the wing formation decision and address the advantages of focus endogenously in our model. Using data from a large urban teaching hospital in the United States along with a national database, we report on a number of managerial insights. In particular, as the overall demand increases across all care types, wings are formed to reserve more beds for higher-utility types, which leads to higher overall hospital utility but also some disparity across types, such as increased hospital access for some and decreased access for others. Furthermore, overall bed occupancy decreases as the hospital is split into wings. However, if sufficient focus is attained, shorter lengths-of-stay associated with focused care may increase overall patient throughput. We also observe that when patients are willing to wait longer for admission, the hospital tends to form more wings. This implies that hospitals that garner longer waits can form more specialized wings and thereby benefit from focused care, whereas hospitals that cannot will tend to form fewer, if any, wings, choosing to pool demand and bed capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2014.0516","","MSOM","Operations Management","4","['disparity', 'access', 'utility']","The article discusses disparities in hospital access and the trade-offs in care types, indicating a moderate awareness of social equity issues in healthcare.

We propose a dynamic stochastic game-theoretic model that analyzes the optimal technology offer strategies of the asymmetric suppliers and highlights how the size of the current project, relative to the size of the future market, and supplier competition determine the effectiveness of the bundled procurement mechanism for the buyer. For the two-supplier case, we find that each supplier has a dominant technology offer strategy that is independent of the opponent\u2019s strategy. When the relative size of the project is small, suppliers only offer obsolete technologies even if their technologies are perfect substitutes. While suppliers offer better technologies as the project size increases, their responses in technology offers are not continuous with respect to the project size\u2014once the project size reaches some threshold, suppliers\u2019 optimal responses jump to their best technologies.

We find that even small model errors\u2014on the order of 1%\u20132% of the empirical futures price variance\u2014can have a disproportionate impact on storage valuation and hedging. In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches.

To address procurement cost fluctuation, the firm adopts a dual-sourcing strategy, under which it procures from a spot market with immediate delivery and through a forward-buying contract with postponed delivery. Our analysis offers the unique insight that a risk-neutral firm may earn higher expected profit under a more volatile procurement cost process. This is because the firm makes its pricing and sourcing decisions in response to the realized cost in each period. Moreover, we characterize how the firm should dynamically adjust its pricing and sourcing decisions in accordance to cost evolution. For example, if sourcing through the forward-buying contract is less expensive than sourcing directly from the spot market, the optimal safety stock is decreasing in the current spot market purchasing cost. However, the optimal order quantity through the forward-buying contract is, in general, not monotone in the current spot-purchasing cost. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that dynamic pricing and dual sourcing may be either strategic complements or substitutes in the presence of fluctuating procurement costs and uncertain demand. This is because dynamic pricing mitigates demand uncertainty risk and exploits procurement cost fluctuation, whereas dual sourcing may either intensify or dampen demand risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0519","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

When a retailer forecasts demand based on past sales observations, it requires an estimation approach that accounts for this censoring. Several authors have analyzed inventory management with demand learning in environments with censored observations, but the authors assume that inventory levels are known and hence that stockouts are observed. However, firms often do not know how many units of inventory are available to meet demand, a phenomenon known as inventory record inaccuracy. We investigate the impact of this unknown on demand estimation in an environment with censored observations. When the firm does not account for inventory uncertainty when estimating demand, we discover and characterize a systematic downward bias in demand estimation under typical assumptions on the distribution of inventory record inaccuracies. We propose and test a heuristic prescription that relies on a single error statistic and that sharply reduces this bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0520","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand estimation and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, the impact of organizational forgetting (i) differs across the types of quality improvement efforts (quality gains from process improvement initiatives depreciate, whereas those from quality assurance initiatives do not), and (ii) depends on where quality knowledge was embedded (depreciation is lower for knowledge embedded in technology than for knowledge embedded in organizational routines or organizational members).

However, the same strategy does not work well against the deceptive counterfeiter unless high quality facilitates the seizure of deceptive counterfeits significantly. Similarly, reducing price works well in combating the nondeceptive counterfeiter, but it could be ineffective against the deceptive counterfeiter. Moreover, the strategies that improve the profit of the brand-name company may benefit the counterfeiter inadvertently and even hurt consumer welfare.

While the wine is aging in the barrel, expert reviewers taste the wine and create a barrel score, indicating the potential quality of the wine and offering clues as to whether, when bottled, it will be superior wine. Based on the barrel score, the wine producer determines (1) the percentage of its wine to be sold as futures and (2) the price of the wine futures. After one more year of aging, the wine is bottled, and the reviewers provide a second review of the wine and assign a bottle score that influences the market price of the wine. Our study makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model that incorporates uncertain consumer valuations of wine futures and bottled wine and the uncertain bottle rating that is assigned to the wine at the end of the production process. Our analysis provides insights into how the barrel score, consumer preference (through a conditional-value-at-risk perspective) and the winemaker\u2019s preference influence the winemaker\u2019s allocation and pricing decisions. Our second contribution relates to the impact of consumer heterogeneity on the optimal allocation and pricing decisions. Contrary to common belief that the winemaker may be better off when consumers are more homogeneous, our results demonstrate that the winemaker can achieve a higher level of profitability when the market is filled with consumers that are heterogeneous. Third, we test our findings using data collected from Bordeaux wineries engaging in wine futures. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that (1) barrel scores play a significant role in the two decisions regarding the quantity and price of wine futures, and (2) the wine futures market provides a sizable financial benefit to the winemakers. Our analysis yields recommendations for artisanal and boutique wineries that have limited or no experience selling wine futures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0529","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational flexibility and profitability in the wine industry without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The market size in each period is random, following a stationary distribution. Consumers are loss averse with stochastic reference points that represent their beliefs about possible price and product availability. Given the distribution of reference points, they choose purchase plans to maximize their expected total utility, including gain-loss utility, before visiting the store, and follow the plans in the store. In anticipation of consumers' purchase plans, in each period, before demand uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses an initial order quantity. After the uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses a contingent price depending on the demand realization, with the option of clearing inventory by charging a sale price, and otherwise, posting a full price. Over repeated periods, the interaction of the firm\u2019s operational decisions about ordering and contingent pricing and the consumers' purchase actions results in a distribution of reference points, and, in equilibrium, this distribution is consistent with consumers' beliefs. Under this framework of endogenized reference points, we fully characterize the firm\u2019s optimal inventory and contingent pricing policies. We identify conditions under which the firm\u2019s expected price and profit are increasing in the consumer loss aversion level. We also show that the firm can prefer demand variability over no-demand uncertainty. We obtain a set of insights into how consumers' loss aversion affects the firm\u2019s optimal operational policies that are in stark contrast to those obtained in classic newsvendor models. As examples, the optimal full price increases in the initial order quantity; and the optimal full price decreases, while the optimal sales frequency increases, in the procurement cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0532","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

One motivation behind this behavior is to reduce double marginalization through coordinated pricing so that system efficiency is improved and individual members can also benefit. The objective of this paper is to understand how competition in supply chains would impact such joint selling partnerships among complementary suppliers. We first model competition at the supply level, which is generated from the existence of multiple partially substitutable brands (or suppliers) for a particular component. We then extend the analysis to a model that also involves retail competition caused by decentralization among retailers who assemble suppliers' components into final products and sell to customers. The analysis of a model with two complementary components, one of which has multiple brands, indicates that the supply-level competition discourages joint selling of complementary goods. That is, when competing brands become more alike (or substitutable), complementary suppliers act more independently in pricing and selling their items. However, retail competition leads to an opposite effect: Competition among retailers would actually encourage complementary suppliers to package their goods together and act jointly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0533","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain competition and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The renewable technology can be coupled with conventional technologies to form a capacity portfolio that is used to meet stochastic demand for energy. The technologies have different initial investments and operating costs, and the operating costs follow different stochastic processes. We show how to reduce this problem to a single-period decision problem and how to estimate the joint distribution of the stochastic factors using historical data. Importantly, we show that data granularity for renewable yield and electricity demand at a fine level, such as hourly, matters: Without energy storage, coarse data that does not reflect the intermittency of renewable generation may lead to an overinvestment in renewable capacity. We obtain solutions that are simple to compute, intuitive, and provide managers with a framework for evaluating the trade-offs of investing in renewable and conventional technologies. We illustrate our model using two case studies: one for investing in a solar rooftop system for a bank branch and another for investing in a solar thermal system for water heating in a hotel, along with a conventional natural gas heating system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0536","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['renewable energy', 'capacity investment', 'supply intermittency', 'stochastic demand', 'energy storage']","The article discusses renewable energy technology and its implications for capacity investment, which aligns with sustainability themes.

In this paper, we present a model that allows disruptions to be correlated with an uncertain joint distribution, and we apply distributionally robust optimization to minimize the expected cost under the worst-case distribution with given marginal disruption probabilities. The worst-case distribution has a practical interpretation with disruption propagation, and its sparse structure allows solving the problem efficiently. Our numerical results show that ignoring disruption correlation could lead to significant loss that increases dramatically in key factors such as source disaster probability, disruption propagation effect, and service interruption penalty. On the other hand, the robust model results in very low regret, even when disruptions are independent, and starts to outperform the model assuming independence when disruptions are mildly correlated. Most of the benefit of the robust model can be captured with a very low additional cost, which makes it easy to implement. Given these advantages, we believe that the robust model can serve as a promising alternative approach for solving reliable facility location problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0541","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of facility location design and optimization under uncertainty, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each product is produced by a distinct manufacturer, who is offered a consignment contract with revenue sharing by the retailer. The retailer first sets a common revenue share for all products, and each manufacturer then determines the retail price and production quantity for his product. Under certain conditions on price elasticities and cost fractions, we find a unique optimal revenue share for all products. Surprisingly, it is optimal for the retailer not to charge any storage fee in many situations even if she is allowed to do so. Both the retailer\u2019s and manufacturers\u2019 profits first increase and then remain constant as the capacity increases, which implies that an optimal capacity exists.

Customers arrive sequentially, and the firm decides which subset of products to offer to each arriving customer depending on the customer\u2019s preferences, the inventory levels, and the remaining time in the season. We show that it is optimal to limit the choice set of some customers (even when the products are in stock), reserving products with low inventory levels for future customers who may have a stronger preference for those products. In certain settings, we prove that it is optimal to follow a threshold policy under which a product is offered to a customer segment if its inventory level is higher than a threshold value. The thresholds are decreasing in time and increasing in the inventory levels of other products. We introduce two heuristics derived by approximating the future marginal expected revenue by the marginal value of a newsvendor function that captures the substitution dynamics between products. We test the impact of assortment customization using data from a fashion retailer. We find that the potential revenue impact of assortment customization can be significant, especially when customer heterogeneity is high and when the products\u2019 inventory-to-demand ratios are asymmetric.

When patients in these countries initiate treatment, they typically remain on it until death; thus, policy makers and physicians follow nonabandonment policies. However, treated patients develop resistance to treatment, so in many cases untreated patients might benefit more from the drugs. In this paper we quantify the opportunity cost associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies. For this, we use an approximate dynamic programming framework to bound the benefit from allowing premature treatment termination. Our results indicate that in sub-Saharan Africa, the price associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies lies between 4.4% and 8.1% of the total treatment benefit. We also derive superior treatment allocation policies, which shed light on the role behavior and health progression play in prioritizing treatment initiation and termination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0545","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['HIV', 'resource-limited', 'nonabandonment', 'treatment', 'policy']","The article addresses the ethical implications of treatment policies for HIV in resource-limited settings, highlighting issues of access and equity in healthcare.

However, such learning is limited by the amount of inventory carried; when demand exceeds inventory (i.e., when a stock-out event occurs), a retailer in general cannot observe actual demand. We propose using observations on the timing of sales occurrences in a Bayesian fashion to learn about demand, and we analyze this learning method for a multiperiod newsvendor setting. We find that, as previously shown with the use of only stock-out event observations, the optimal order quantity with timing observations is greater than the optimal order quantity with full demand observations. We prove this result using a novel methodology from the statistics literature on comparison of experiments. Although the optimal over-ordering with timing observations tends to be less than that with only stock-out event observations in most cases, we do observe cases where the opposite is true. Such cases correspond to high demand uncertainty and low margins, where marginal learning from timing observations is significantly higher than using only a stock-out event. In an extensive numerical study we find that, on average and with respect to uncensored demand observations, the use of timing observations eliminates 76.1% of the loss in expected profit from using only stock-out event observations. We show that, for Poisson and normal demand with unknown mean, the proposed learning method is tractable as well as intuitively appealing: the information contained in the timing of sales occurrences is fully captured by a single number\u2014the timing of stock-out. We also investigate checkpoint models in which the newsvendor can make observations only at predetermined times in a period, and illustrate its convergence to the models with timing and stock-out event observations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1326","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand estimation and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The two subproblems are modeled as mixed integer linear programs, with specific sets of variables and constraints. Similarly to the classical Benders\u2019 decomposition approach, slave and master communicate through suitable feasibility cuts in the variables of the master. Extensive tests on real-life instances from single and double-track lines in Italy showed significant improvements over current dispatching performances. A decision support system based on this exact approach has been in operation in Norway since February 2014 and represents one of the first operative applications of mathematical optimization to train dispatching.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1327","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution to a logistical problem in train dispatching without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The first concern is that the basic attraction model (BAM), of which the multinomial logit (MNL) model is a special case, tends to overestimate demand recapture in practice. The second concern is that the choice-based deterministic linear program, currently in use to derive heuristics for the stochastic network revenue management problem, has an exponential number of variables. We introduce a generalized attraction model (GAM) that allows for partial demand dependencies ranging from the BAM to the independent demand model (IDM). We also provide an axiomatic justification for the GAM and a method to estimate its parameters. As a choice model, the GAM is of practical interest because of its flexibility to adjust product-specific recapture. Our second contribution is a new formulation called the sales-based linear program (SBLP) that works for the GAM. This formulation avoids the exponential number of variables in the earlier choice-based network RM (revenue management) approaches and is essentially the same size as the well-known LP formulation for the IDM. The SBLP should be of interest to revenue managers because it makes choice-based network RM problems tractable to solve. In addition, the SBLP formulation yields new insights into the assortment problem that arises when capacities are infinite. Together these contributions move forward the state of the art for network revenue management under customer choice and competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1328","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network revenue management and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We show that by randomly assigning customers different service grades with different service rates, the average waiting time can be reduced without affecting the mean service time. Such differentiation introduces more service time variability, but it also creates information that enables the implementation of service rate-based scheduling, which mitigates the increased variance and may even reduce the total waiting time. We provide conditions under which our static service differentiation reduces waiting, and further derive closed-form expressions for the optimal differentiation policy, which shows that both optimal service rates and allocation probabilities form geometric sequences. We illustrate our policy in the context of quality-based service domains, in which customers value service time but dislike waiting.

The Searcher can move along the network from a given starting point at unit speed, but to actually find the Hider she must pass it while moving at a fixed slower speed (which may depend on the arc). In this \u201cbimodal search game,\u201d the payoff is the first time the Searcher passes the Hider while moving at her slow speed. This game models the search for a small or well hidden object (e.g., a contact lens, improvised explosive device, predator search for camouflaged prey). We define a bimodal Chinese postman tour as a tour of minimum time \u03b4 which traverses every point of every arc at least once in the slow mode. For trees and weakly Eulerian networks (networks containing a number of disjoint Eulerian cycles connected in a tree-like fashion) the value of the bimodal search game is \u03b4/2. For trees, the optimal Hider strategy has full support on the network. This differs from traditional search games, where it is optimal for him to hide only at leaf nodes. We then consider the notion of a lucky Searcher who can also detect the Hider with a positive probability q even when passing him at her fast speed.

We prove that given a flexibility design, a general class of worst-case performance measures can be expressed as functions of the design\u2019s PCIs and the given uncertainty set. This result has several major implications. First, it suggests a method to compare the worst-case performances of different flexibility designs without the need to know the specifics of the uncertainty sets. Second, we prove that under symmetric uncertainty sets and a large class of worst-case performance measures, the long chain, a celebrated sparse design, is superior to a large class of sparse flexibility designs, including any design that has a degree of two on each of its product nodes. Third, we show that under stochastic demand, the classical Jordan and Graves (JG) index can be expressed as a function of the PCIs. Furthermore, the PCIs motivate a modified JG index that is shown to be more effective in our numerical study. Finally, the PCIs lead to a heuristic for finding sparse flexibility designs that perform well under expected sales and have lower risk measures in our computational study.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1334","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on theoretical aspects of process flexibility designs and performance measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we develop a framework to study such strategic arrivals into queueing networks. We study the population game wherein users strategically choose when to arrive at a parallel queueing network and upon arrival, which of the queues to join. The queues start service at given times, which can potentially be different. We characterize the (strategic) arrival process at each of the queues and the price of anarchy of the ensuing strategic arrival game. We then extend the analysis to multiple populations of users, each with a different cost metric. The equilibrium arrival profile and price of anarchy are derived. Finally, we extend this to general feedforward network architectures by modeling the arrival timing game as a two-stage extensive form game. We prove the existence and essential uniqueness of equilibria. We also study more specific network topologies, like tandem and trellis networks, and we derive the equilibrium arrival and routing profiles. We show that there exists an equivalent parallel queueing network that has the same equilibrium arrival profile. Thus, the price of anarchy of the arrival game is then implied by that of the parallel queueing network.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1338","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing networks and strategic arrival processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To this end, we use delay differential equations to understand the evolution of awareness in the presence of ad memorability. This extended model generates optimal advertising policies that include the even spending policy, blitz policy, and various cyclic pulsing policies, depending on whether ad memorability exceeds a critical threshold. The extended model not only unifies the various patterns of advertising spending over time, but also augments the prior research by furnishing the optimality of pulsing advertising. Thus ad memorability could drive pulsing.

Even in settings where the demand for a seller\u2019s products also depends on decisions of other sellers, the models often do not explicitly account for such decisions. It has been conjectured in the revenue management literature that such monopoly models may incorporate the effects of competition, because the parameter estimates of the monopoly models are based on data collected in the presence of competition. In this paper we take a closer look at such a setting to investigate the behavior of parameter estimates and decisions if monopoly models are used in the presence of competition. We consider repeated pricing games in which two competing sellers use mathematical models to choose the prices of their products. Over the sequence of games, each seller attempts to estimate the values of the parameters of a demand model that expresses demand as a function only of its own price using data comprised only of its own past prices and demand realizations. We analyze the behavior of the sellers\u2019 parameter estimates and prices under various assumptions regarding the sellers\u2019 knowledge and estimation procedures, and we identify situations in which (a) the sellers\u2019 prices converge to the Nash equilibrium associated with knowledge of the correct demand model, (b) the sellers\u2019 prices converge to the cooperative solution, and (c) the sellers\u2019 prices have many potential limit points that are neither the Nash equilibrium nor the cooperative solution and that depend on the initial conditions. We compare the sellers\u2019 revenues at potential limit prices with their revenues at the Nash equilibrium and the cooperative solution, and we show that it is possible for sellers to be better off when using a monopoly model than at the Nash equilibrium.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1341","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management and pricing models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Debris clearance is aimed at pushing the debris to the sides of the roads so that relief distribution and search-and-rescue operations can be maintained in a timely manner. Given the limited resources, uncertainty, and urgency during disaster response, efficient and effective planning of debris clearance to achieve connectivity between relief demand and supply is important. In this paper, we define the stochastic debris clearance problem (SDCP), which captures post-disaster situations where the limited information on the debris amounts along the roads is updated as clearance activities proceed. The main decision in SDCP is to determine a sequence of roads to clear in each period such that benefit accrued by satisfying relief demand is maximized. To solve SDCP to optimality, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process model. We then propose a heuristic based on a continuous-time approximation, and we further reduce the computational burden by applying a limited look ahead on the search tree and heuristic pruning. The performance of these approaches is tested on randomly generated instances that reflect various geographical and information settings, and instances based on a real-world earthquake scenario. The results of these experiments underline the importance of applying a stochastic approach and indicate significant improvements over heuristics that mimic the current practice for debris clearance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1342","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['disaster', 'relief', 'efficiency']","The article discusses debris management in post-disaster scenarios, which touches on themes of relief and efficiency in crisis situations.

Disclosure and Inspection Policies for Green Production","We examine the interplay between two important decisions that impact environmental performance in a production setting: inspections performed by a regulator and noncompliance disclosure by a production firm. To preempt the penalty that will be levied once a compliance violation is discovered in an inspection, the firm dynamically decides whether it should disclose a random occurrence of noncompliance. Anticipating this, the regulator determines inspection frequency and penalty amounts to minimize environmental and social costs, performing either random inspections or periodic inspections. We study this problem by developing a novel analytical framework that combines features from reliability theory and law enforcement economics. We find that, contrary to common belief, surprising the firm with random inspections is not always preferred to inspecting the firm periodically according to a set schedule. We also find that the firm\u2019s opportunistic disclosure timing behavior may lead to a partial disclosure equilibrium in which the substitutable relationship between inspection intensity and penalty is reversed; a threat of increased penalty is accompanied by more frequent inspections.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1345","","OR","Multidisciplinary","6","['environmental performance', 'noncompliance', 'social costs', 'disclosure', 'inspections']","The article discusses environmental performance and social costs, indicating a focus on sustainability and ethical practices in production.

In a dynamic network routing game each infinitesimal particle is interpreted as a player that seeks to complete its journey in the least possible time.

After measuring portfolio credit risk, an important step toward active risk management is to measure risk contributions of individual obligors to the overall risk of the portfolio. In practice, value-at-risk is often used as a risk measure for credit portfolios, and it can be decomposed into a sum of the risk contributions of individual obligors. Estimation of these risk contributions is computationally challenging, mainly because they are expectations conditioned on a rare event. In this paper, we tackle this computational problem by developing a restricted importance sampling (RIS) method for a class of conditional-independence credit risk models, where defaults of obligors are conditionally independent given an appropriately chosen random vector. We propose fast estimators for risk contributions and their confidence intervals. Furthermore, we study the incorporation of traditional importance sampling methods into the RIS method to further improve its efficiency for the widely used Gaussian copula model.

We develop generalized almost second-degree stochastic dominance and almost second-degree risk in terms of the appropriate utility classes and their corresponding integral conditions, and extend these concepts to higher degrees. We address implementation issues and show that generalized almost stochastic dominance inherits the appealing properties of stochastic dominance.

Each learning mode incurs cost at a particular rate and provides information of a particular quality. In addition to dynamic decisions about its learning mode, the firm must decide when to stop learning and either invest or abandon the project. Using a continuous-time Bayesian framework, and assuming a binary prior distribution for the project\u2019s unknown value, we solve both the discounted and undiscounted versions of this problem. In the undiscounted case, the optimal learning policy is to choose the mode that has the smallest cost per signal quality. When the discount rate is strictly positive, we prove that an optimal learning and investment policy can be summarized by a small number of critical values, and the firm only uses learning modes that lie on a certain convex envelope in cost-rate-versus-signal-quality space. We extend our analysis to consider a firm that can choose multiple learning modes simultaneously, which requires the analysis of both investment timing and dynamic subset selection decisions. We solve both the discounted and undiscounted versions of this problem and explicitly identify sets of learning modes that are used under the optimal policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1344","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investment timing and learning modes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We modify the Erlang-A model to account for service slowdowns and carry out the performance analysis in the quality- and efficiencydriven (QED) regime. We find that when the load sensitivity is low, the system can achieve QED performance, but the square-root staffing parameter requires an adjustment to achieve the same performance as an ordinary Erlang-A queue. When the load sensitivity is high, the system alternates randomly between a QED and an efficiency-driven (ED) regime performance levels, a phenomenon that we refer to as bistability. We analyze how the system scale and model parameters affect the bistability phenomenon and propose an admission control policy to avoid ED performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1346","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service systems and performance analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each facility faces Poisson demand and replenishes according to a base-stock policy in a fixed time interval. Fixed costs are incurred for placing an order. The warehouse fills the retailers\u2019 orders in the same sequence as the occurrence of the demand at the retailers. The objective is to minimize the average system cost per period. This paper develops an evaluation scheme and provides a method to obtain the optimal base-stock levels and reorder intervals. Specifically, with fixed reorder intervals, we show that the optimal base-stock levels can be obtained by generalizing the result in the literature. To find the optimal reorder intervals, we first allocate the total system cost to each facility and then construct a lower bound to the allocated facility cost. These lower bound functions, which are separable functions of reorder intervals, can be used to derive bounds for the optimal reorder intervals. The key to tightening the bounds is to obtain a near-optimal total cost. Thus, we propose a simple heuristic that modifies the algorithm that solves the deterministic counterpart. The results of numerical studies suggest that the optimal reorder intervals tend to satisfy integer-ratio relationships and that the suggested heuristic can generate effective integer-ratio policies for large systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1347","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and cost optimization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The search region is divided into grid cells, and the searcher decides which cell to visit next and whether to search it quickly or slowly. A quick search of a cell containing the target may damage it, resulting in a failed search, or it may locate the target safely. If the target is not in the cell, the search continues over the remaining cells. If a slow search is performed on a cell, then the search ends in failure with a fixed probability regardless of whether or not the target is in that cell (e.g., because of enemy fire while performing the slow search). If the slow search survives this failure possibility, then the search ends in success if the target is in that cell; otherwise, the search continues over the remaining cells. We seek to minimize the probability of the search ending in failure and consider two types of rules for visiting cells: the unconstrained search, in which the searcher may visit cells in any order, and the constrained search, in which the searcher may only visit adjacent cells (e.g., up, down, left, or right of cells already visited). We prove that the optimal policy for the unconstrained search is to search quickly some initial set of cells with the lowest probabilities of containing the target before slowly searching the remaining cells in decreasing order of probabilities. For the special case in which a quick search on a cell containing the target damages it with certainty, the optimal policy is to search all cells slowly, in decreasing order of probabilities. We use the optimal solution of the unconstrained search in a branch-and-bound optimal solution algorithm for the constrained search. For larger instances, we evaluate heuristics and approximate dynamic programming approaches for finding good solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1349","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of search optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

One of the most widely used conditions for constructing the utility function is the assumption of mutual preferential independence where trade-offs among any subset of the attributes do not depend on the instantiations of the remaining attributes. Mutual preferential independence asserts that ordinal preferences can be represented by an additive function of the attributes. This paper derives the most general form of a multiattribute utility function that (i) exhibits mutual preferential independence and (ii) is strictly increasing with each argument at the maximum value of the complement attributes. We show that a multiattribute utility function satisfies these two conditions if and only if it is an Archimedean combination of univariate utility assessments. This result enables the construction of multiattribute utility functions that satisfy additive ordinal preferences using univariate utility assessments and a single generating function. We also provide a nonparametric approach for estimating the generating function of the Archimedean form by iteration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1350","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision analysis and utility functions without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

This problem consists of determining the optimal fraction of patients to be screened in every period as well as the optimum staffing level at each part of the healthcare system to maximize the total health benefits to the patients measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. We modeled this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer programming program comprising disease progression (the transition of the patients across health states), system dynamics (the flow of patients in different health states across various parts of the healthcare delivery system), and budgetary and capacity constraints. We applied the model to the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) station in the Veterans Health Administration system. We found that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine screening policy in which all patients visiting the system are screened for HIV irrespective of risk factors may not be feasible because of budgetary constraints. Consequently, we used the model to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current risk based screening policy of screening only high risk patients. Our computational analysis showed that the GLA station can achieve substantial increase (20% to 300%) in the QALYs gained by using these policies over risk based screening. The GLA station has already adapted two of these policies that could yield better patient health outcomes over the next few years.

This relaxation can be strengthened by using piecewise-linear functions that over- and under-estimate each bilinear term. Although there is a significant amount of empirical evidence to show that such piecewise-linear relaxations, which can be written as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), yield good bounds for the pooling problem, to the best of our knowledge, no formal result regarding the quality of these relaxations is known. In this paper, we prove that the ratio of the upper bound obtained by solving piecewise-linear relaxations (objective function is maximization) to the optimal objective function value of the pooling problem is at most n, where n is the number of output nodes. Furthermore for any \u03f5 > 0 and for any piecewise-linear relaxation, there exists an instance where the ratio of the relaxation value to the optimal value is at least n \u2212 \u03f5. This analysis naturally yields a polynomial-time n-approximation algorithm for the pooling problem. We also show that if there exists a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the pooling problem with guarantee better than n1\u2212\u03f5 for any \u03f5 > 0, then NP-complete problems have randomized polynomial-time algorithms. Finally, motivated by the approximation algorithm, we design a heuristic that involves solving an MILP-based restriction of the pooling problem. This heuristic is guaranteed to provide solutions within a factor of n. On large-scale test instances and in significantly lesser time, this heuristic provides solutions that are often orders of magnitude better than those given by commercial local and global optimization solvers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1357","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of mixed-integer linear programming techniques without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In this paper we propose transshipment as a powerful mechanism to mitigate the mismatch between the supply and demand. We consider a finite horizon multi-period inventory system where in each period two retailers have the option to replenish their inventory from a supplier (if there is any supply) or via transshipment from the other retailer. Each retailer observes nonnegative stochastic demand with general distribution in each period and incurs overstocking/understocking costs as well as costs for replenishment and transshipment that may be time dependent. We study a stochastic control problem where the objective is to determine the optimal joint replenishment and transshipment policies so as to minimize the total expected cost over the season. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and show that unlike the known order-up-to level inventory policy, the optimal ordering policy in each period is determined based on two switching curves. Similarly, the optimal transshipment policy is also identified by two switching curves. These four curves together partition the optimal joint ordering and transshipment polices to eight regions where in each region the optimal policy is an order-up-to-curve policy. We demonstrate that the structure of the optimal policy holds for any known sequence and combination of ordering and transshipment over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1358","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the robust optimization framework, a min-max problem is solved wherein a solution is evaluated according to its performance on the worst possible realization of the parameters. In many cases, a straightforward solution to a robust optimization problem of a certain type requires solving an optimization problem of a more complicated type, which might be NP-hard in some cases. For example, solving a robust conic quadratic program, such as those arising in a robust support vector machine (SVM) with an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, leads in general to a semidefinite program. In this paper, we develop a method for approximately solving a robust optimization problem using tools from online convex optimization, where at every stage a standard (nonrobust) optimization program is solved. Our algorithms find an approximate robust solution using a number of calls to an oracle that solves the original (nonrobust) problem that is inversely proportional to the square of the target accuracy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1374","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of robust optimization without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

In these models, products are often described as a vector of observed characteristics. A consumer chooses the product that maximizes her utility, assumed to be a function of the observed product characteristics and the consumer\u2019s preference over these product characteristics. One central task in the demand estimation literature is to infer, based on observed data, consumers\u2019 preferences on product characteristics. We consider such an estimation problem for pure characteristics models, a class of random coefficients demand models without the idiosyncratic logit error term in a consumer\u2019s utility function. The absence of the logit error term and the use of numerical integration to approximate the integral in aggregate market shares lead to a nonsmooth formulation of approximated market share equations. As a result, solving the approximated market share equations and estimating the model by using existing methods proposed in the econometrics literature remain computationally intractable. To overcome this difficulty, we first characterize consumers\u2019 purchase decisions by a system of complementarity constraints. This new characterization leads to smooth approximated market share equations and allows us to cast the corresponding generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation problem essentially as a quadratic program with linear complementarity constraints, parameterized by an exponential, thus nonlinear, function of the structural parameter on price. We also extend this estimation framework to incorporate an endogenous pricing mechanism that captures the competitive profit maximization behavior of the producing firms. We provide existence results of a solution for the GMM estimator and present numerical results to demonstrate the computational effectiveness of our approach.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1377","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand modeling and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The cost structure is linear, with arbitrary cost rates. Our demand model is the unique regular extension of a set of demand functions that are affine in a limited polyhedral subset of the price space. A set of demand functions is regular if it satisfies the following conditions: Under any given price vector, when some product is priced out of the market, i.e., has zero demand, any increase of its price has no impact on the demand volumes. Depending on the set of prices selected by the competing firms, a different product assortment is offered in the market. We characterize the equilibrium prices, product assortment, and sales volumes in the price competition model, under this demand model. Under minimal conditions, we show that a pure Nash equilibrium always exists; while multiple price equilibria may arise, they are equivalent in the sense of generating an identical product assortment and sales volumes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1380","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical model of price competition without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The decision maker selects a feasible subset of projects so that the risk of the portfolio return not meeting a specified target is minimized. To model and evaluate this risk, we propose and justify a general performance measure, the underperformance riskiness index (URI). We define a special case of the URI, the entropic underperformance riskiness index (EURI), for the project selection problem. We minimize the EURI of the project portfolio, which is the reciprocal of the absolute risk aversion (ARA) of an ambiguity-averse individual with constant ARA who is indifferent between the target return with certainty and the uncertain portfolio return. The EURI extends the riskiness index of Aumann and Serrano (2008) by incorporating the target and distributional ambiguity, and controls the underperformance probability (UP) for any target level. Our model includes correlation and interaction effects such as synergies. Since the model is a discrete nonlinear optimization problem, we derive the optimal solution using Benders decomposition techniques. We show that computationally efficient solution of the model is possible. Furthermore, the project portfolios generated by minimizing the underperformance risk are more than competitive in achieving the target with those found by benchmark approaches, including maximization of expected return, minimization of UP, mean-variance analysis, and maximization of Roy\u2019s safety-first ratio (1952).

Thus the Asian option prices under a one-dimensional Markov process can be obtained by first constructing a CTMC to approximate the targeted Markov process model, and then computing the Asian option prices under the approximate CTMC by numerically inverting the double transforms.

When each product consumes one unit of capacity, our capacity constraint limits the cardinality of the offered assortment. For the cardinality constrained case, we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal assortment. When the capacity consumption of each product is arbitrary, we give an algorithm to obtain a 4-approximate solution. We show that we can compute an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue for an individual problem instance by solving a linear program. In our numerical experiments, we consider problem instances involving products with arbitrary capacity consumptions. Comparing the expected revenues from the assortments obtained by our 4-approximation algorithm with the upper bounds on the optimal expected revenues, our numerical results indicate that the 4-approximation algorithm performs quite well, yielding less than 2% optimality gap on average.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1383","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of assortment optimization and capacity constraints without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The dedicated production lines and the shared resource for calibration face capacity uncertainties. The firm holds inventory of products that are not yet calibrated and carries out calibration when an order is received. We analyze a multiperiod inventory model for two products and derive the optimal production policy at stage 1 as well as the optimal allocation of the shared resource to demands at stage 2. For the shared resource, because of its capacity uncertainty, not only the total planned production quantities matter, but also the sequence in which the products are processed. We characterize the optimal allocation of the shared resource and show that the optimal policy keeps the ending inventories of products as close to a so-called \u201ctarget path\u201d as possible. For the dedicated production lines, because of their capacity uncertainty, the optimal production policy depends on the initial inventories. We identify and characterize the structural properties of the optimal production policy. Through a numerical study, we explore how the presence of finite shared capacity influences the inventory targets. We find that the behavior may be counterintuitive: when multiple products share a finite capacity in stage 2, the inventory target for the product having a larger dedicated production capacity or less capacity variability in stage 1 can be higher than the other product. We finally provide sensitivity analysis for the optimal policy and test the performance of simple heuristic policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1387","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and inventory control without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The physicians must choose between catering to patients right after triage, who are yet to be checked, and those who are in process (IP) and are occasionally returning to be checked. Physician capacity is thus modeled as a queueing system with multiclass customers, where some of the classes face deadline constraints on their time-till-first-service, whereas the other classes feedback through service while incurring congestion costs. We consider two types of such costs: first, costs that are incurred at queue-dependent rates and second, costs that are functions of IP sojourn time. The former is our base model, which paves the way for the latter (perhaps more ED realistic). In both cases, we propose and analyze scheduling policies that, asymptotically in conventional heavy traffic, minimize congestion costs while adhering to all deadline constraints. Our policies have two parts: the first chooses between triage and IP patients; assuming triage patients are chosen, the physicians serve the one who is closest to violating the deadline; alternatively, IP patients are served according to a Gc\u03bc rule, in which \u03bc is simply modified to account for feedbacks. For our proposed policies, we establish asymptotic optimality, and develop some congestion laws (snapshot principles) that support forecasting of waiting and sojourn times. Simulation then shows that these policies outperform some commonly used ones. It also validates our laws and demonstrates that some ED features, the complexity of which reaches beyond our model (e.g., time-varying arrival rates, leave without being seen (LWBS) or leave against medical advice (LAMA)), do not lead to significant performance degradation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1389","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of patient flow management in emergency departments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If, in addition to re-optimizations, we also frequently re-estimate the parameters, we prove that the performance of PAC in the unknown parameters setting is almost as good as the performance of PAC in the known parameters setting.

This paper takes a step toward extending the robust optimization methodology to problems with integer recourse, which have largely resisted solution so far. To this end, we approximate two-stage robust binary programs by their corresponding K-adaptability problems, in which the decision maker precommits to K second-stage policies, here -and-now, and implements the best of these policies once the uncertain parameters are observed. We study the approximation quality and the computational complexity of the K-adaptability problem, and we propose two mixed-integer linear programming reformulations that can be solved with off-the-shelf software.

The process may continue making transitions among the out-of-control states, or even back to the in-control state until it reaches an absorbing state. We assume that at least one out-of-control state is absorbing. The objective is to minimize the expected total cost over a finite horizon. By transforming the standard Cartesian belief space into the spherical coordinate system, we show that the optimal policy has a simple control-limit structure. We also examine two specialized models. The first is the phase-type transition time model, in which we develop an algorithm whose complexity is not affected by the number of phases. The second is a model with multiple absorbing out-of-control states, by which we show that certain out-of-control states may incur less total cost than the in-control state, a phenomenon never occurs in the two-state models. We conclude that there are fundamental differences between multistate models and two-state models, and that the spherical coordinate transformation offers significant analytical and computational benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1396","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for process control with no mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

For the multistage problem, we also use a warm start procedure that relies on the solution of the simpler two-stage problem. Finally, we exploit the reoptimization capabilities of Benders decomposition in a sample average approximation method for the two-stage problem and in a rollout algorithm for the multistage problem. Computational experiments show that instances of realistic size can be solved to optimality for the two-stage and multistage problems, and that Benders decomposition provides significant speedups compared to a classical branch-and-cut algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1401","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production routing and optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Two prominent heuristics sequentially reoptimize simple models, leading to the so-called rolling intrinsic (RI) policy and rolling basket of spread options (RSO) policy. The extant literature numerically demonstrates that these two policies are nearly optimal in many realistic settings and can be used with Monte Carlo simulation to obtain fairly accurate estimates of the value of storage contracts. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the observed benefit of reoptimization with these heuristics and additional numerical evidence for the near optimal performance of the RI and RSO policies in several practical cases, but shows that the RI policy significantly outperforms the RSO policy in some of these cases. This research also proves that the RSO policy has a double basestock target structure, a known property of an optimal policy that is trivially true for the RI policy. Moreover, this work develops efficient and effective dual bounds to assess the performance of merchant commodity storage heuristics. In particular, these bounds are immediately relevant to the developers and users of the two considered heuristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1407","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of commodity storage and inventory trading without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2015","63","5","Omar BesbesOmar Besbesob2105@gsb.columbia.eduColumbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author, Yonatan GurYonatan Gurygur@stanford.eduStanford University, Stanford, California 94305Search for more papers by this author, Assaf ZeeviAssaf Zeeviassaf@gsb.columbia.eduColumbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author","Non-Stationary Stochastic Optimization","We consider a non-stationary variant of a sequential stochastic optimization problem, in which the underlying cost functions may change along the horizon.

We identify sharp conditions under which it is possible to achieve long-run average optimality and more refined performance measures such as rate optimality that fully characterize the complexity of such problems. In doing so, we also establish a strong connection between two rather disparate strands of literature: (1) adversarial online convex optimization and (2) the more traditional stochastic approximation paradigm (couched in a non-stationary setting). This connection is the key to deriving well-performing policies in the latter, by leveraging structure of optimal policies in the former.

The supply chain is owned by a single firm with two divisions. The downstream division (headquarters), facing random customer demand, replenishes materials from the upstream division. The firm installs a financial services platform that pools the divisions\u2019 cash into a master account managed by the headquarters. In each period, cash is received from customers and paid to the outside vendor after materials are delivered. The headquarters determines how much cash to retain for inventory replenishment. The objective is to determine an optimal joint inventory replenishment and cash retention policy for the entire supply chain. We prove that the optimal policy has a surprisingly simple structure\u2014both divisions implement a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment; the headquarters monitors the corporate working capital and implements a two-threshold policy for cash retention. This result is obtained by extending the well-known Clark-Scarf decomposition with newly derived cash-related penalty functions. The optimal policy enables us to investigate the interaction between cash and inventory decisions. We show that in the presence of transaction costs, a firm may stock more even if the inventory holding cost increases. To quantify the value of financial integration, we compare the cash pooling model with systems under different levels of financial integration. Our study suggests that the value of cash pooling can be significant when demand is increasing (respectively, stationary) and the internal transfer price is low (respectively, high). Nevertheless, a significant amount of cash pooling benefit may be recovered if the headquarters can optimize the internal transfer price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1409","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and financial integration without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To solve the problem, we develop a new method called the Penalty Function with Memory (PFM). It is similar to an existing penalty-type method\u2014which consists of a penalty parameter and a measure of violation of constraints\u2014in a sense that it converts a DOvS problem with constraints into a series of unconstrained problems. However, PFM uses a different penalty parameter, called a penalty sequence, determined by the past history of feasibility checks on a solution. Specifically, assuming a minimization problem, a penalty sequence diverges to infinity for any infeasible solution but converges to zero for any feasible solution under certain conditions. As a result, a DOvS algorithm combined with PFM performs well even when an optimal feasible solution is a boundary solution with one or more active constraints. We prove convergence properties and discuss parameter selection for the implementation of PFM. Experimental results on a number of numerical examples show that a DOvS algorithm combined with PFM works well.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1417","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization method without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on dynamic operational decision problems of a firm where risky cash flows are being resolved over time. The firm can finance consumption by borrowing or saving to attain prescribed consumption targets over time. To evaluate the ability of the consumption in meeting respective targets, we propose the consumption shortfall risk (CSR) criterion, which has salient properties of attainment content, starvation aversion, subadditivity, and positive homogeneity. We show that if borrowing and saving are unrestricted and their interest rates are common, the optimal policy that minimizes the CSR criterion is to finance consumption at the target level for all periods except the last. For general convex dynamic decision problems, the optimal policies correspond to those that maximize an additive expected utility, in which the underlying utility functions are concave and increasing.

We generate 20 instances (each with more than 1.3 million integer and 4 billion continuous variables) of the staffing and scheduling problem using 3.5 years of patient volume data from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Computational results show that the efficiency gained from the convexification of the recourse function is further enhanced by our modifications to the L-shaped method.

We propose a provably convergent ADP algorithm called Monotone-ADP that exploits the monotonicity of the value functions to increase the rate of convergence. In this paper, we describe a general finite-horizon problem setting where the optimal value function is monotone, present a convergence proof for Monotone-ADP under various technical assumptions, and show numerical results for three application domains: optimal stopping, energy storage/allocation, and glycemic control for diabetes patients.

Absent large increases in capacity, airport congestion can only be mitigated through scheduling interventions or improved capacity utilization. This paper presents an integrated approach that jointly optimizes the airport\u2019s flight schedule at the strategic level and the utilization of airport capacity at the tactical level, subject to scheduling, capacity, and delay-reduction constraints. The capacity-utilization part involves controlling the runway configuration and the balance of arrival and departure service rates to minimize congestion costs. The schedule optimization reschedules a selected set of flights to reduce the demand-capacity mismatches while minimizing interference with airline competitive scheduling. We develop an original iterative solution algorithm that integrates a stochastic queuing model of airport congestion, a dynamic programming model of capacity utilization, and an integer programming model of scheduling interventions. The algorithm is shown to converge in reasonable computational times. Extensive computational results for JFK Airport suggest that substantial delay reductions can be achieved through limited changes in airline schedules. It is also shown that the proposed integrated approach to airport congestion mitigation performs significantly better than the typical sequential approach, where scheduling and operational decisions are made separately.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1428","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical solutions to airport congestion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We study the repeated interaction between peak producers with a model that captures both the uncertainty in their short-term revenues and their market power. We investigate the conditions under which peak producers can implicitly coordinate to achieve high prices, under varying demand conditions. We analyze how financial objectives in the form of annual performance targets dynamically impact peakers\u2019 pricing decisions, and the conditions under which setting such targets may benefit or hurt the owners of the firm. We further show how portfolio integration with lower marginal cost technologies can be an important factor in peak price setting, beyond the usual considerations of direct price externalities, capacity manipulation, or risk. These insights are useful not only in understanding how purely energy-based revenues can sustain the financial viability of peakers, and the dynamic emergence of price spikes, but also in providing the underlying process for pricing derivative contracts that policy makers may encourage or offer for resource adequacy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1429","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and financial viability in energy production without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The new conditions are more concise and more transparent than traditional ones. They are directly related to applications because present values are widely used tools in intertemporal choice. Our conditions give more general behavioral axiomatizations, which facilitate normative debates and empirical tests of time inconsistencies and related phenomena. Like other preference conditions, our conditions can be tested qualitatively. Unlike other preference conditions, our conditions can also be directly tested quantitatively, and we can verify the required independence of present values from predictors in regressions. We show how similar types of preference conditions, imposing independence conditions between directly observable quantities, can be developed for decision contexts other than intertemporal choice and can simplify behavioral axiomatizations there. Our preference conditions are especially efficient if several types of aggregation are relevant because we can handle them in one stroke. We thus give an efficient axiomatization of a market pricing system that is (i) arbitrage-free for hedging uncertainties and (ii) time consistent.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1433","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of intertemporal choice and preference conditions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2015","63","6","Andr\u00e1s Pr\u00e9kopaAndr\u00e1s Pr\u00e9kopaprekopa@rutcor.rutgers.eduRutgers Center for Operations Research, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854Search for more papers by this author, Merve UnuvarMerve Unuvarmunuvar@us.ibm.comIBM T.

The problem is to find minimum cost optimal built in capacities at the nodes and arcs subject to the constraint that all demands should be met on a prescribed probability level (reliability constraint) and some deterministic constraints should be satisfied. The reliability constraint is formulated in terms of the Gale\u2013Hoffman feasibility inequalities, but their number is reduced by elimination technique. The concept of a p-efficient point is used in a smart way to convert and then relax the problem into an LP. The p-efficient points are simultaneously generated with the solution of the LP. The joint distribution of the demands is used to obtain the p-efficient points for all stochastic inequalities that were not eliminated and the solution of a multiple choice knapsack problem is used to generate p-efficient points.

Historically, such surveillance was based on voluntary reports by medical practitioners, but with the widespread adoption of electronic medical records and comprehensive patient databases, surveillance systems that utilize such data are of considerable interest. Unfortunately, existing methods for analyzing the data in such systems ignore the open-ended exploratory nature of such systems that requires the assessment of multiple possible adverse events. In this article, we propose a method, SEQMEDS, that assesses the effect of a single drug on multiple adverse events by analyzing data that accumulate sequentially and explicitly captures interdependencies among the multiple events. The method continuously monitors a vector-valued test-statistic derived from the cumulative number of adverse events. It flags a potential adverse event once the test-statistic crosses a stopping boundary. We employ asymptotic analysis that assumes a large number of observations in a given window of time to show how to compute the stopping boundary by solving a convex optimization problem that achieves a desired Type I error and minimizes the expected time to detection under a pre-specified alternative hypothesis. We apply our method to a model in which the interdependency among the multiple adverse events is captured by a Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates and demonstrate that it provides an approximation of a fully sequential test for the maximum hazard ratio of the drug over multiple adverse events. A numerical study verifies that our method delivers Type I /II errors that are below pre-specified levels and is robust to distributional assumptions and parameter values.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1435","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of drug surveillance and statistical methods without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2015","63","6","Yan LiuYan Liuhnnyly@gmail.comResearch Center for Management Science and Data Analytics, School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai 200433, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author, William L.

A patient customer will wait up to some fixed number of time periods for the price of the product to fall below his or her valuation at which point the customer will make a purchase. If the price does not fall below a patient customer\u2019s valuation at any time during those periods, then that customer will leave without buying. In contrast, impatient customers will not wait, and either buy immediately or leave without buying. We prove that there is an optimal dynamic pricing policy comprised of repeating cycles of decreasing prices. We obtain bounds on the length of these cycles, and we exploit these results to produce an efficient dynamic programming approach for computing such an optimal policy. We also consider problems in which customers have variable levels of patience. For such problems, cycles of decreasing prices may no longer be optimal, but numerical experiments nevertheless suggest that such a decreasing cyclic policy (suitably chosen) often performs quite well.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1438","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical pricing problem without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2015","63","6","Shining WuShining Wusn.wu@polyu.edu.hkDepartment of Logistics and Maritime Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong KongSearch for more papers by this author, Qian LiuQian Liuqianliu@ust.hkDepartment of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong KongSearch for more papers by this author, Rachel Q.

At the beginning of each season (stage 1), the retailer places an order and sells the product at the full price. As the sales unfold, the retailer has an opportunity to mark down the price (stage 2), which creates an incentive for strategic consumers to delay their purchases for price discount. However, consumers do not know the markdown price exactly when they time their purchases; instead, they learn from the retailer\u2019s past prices and form their estimate of the markdown price, called the reference price, to decide if they purchase at the full price or wait for the markdown in the current selling season. We characterize the properties of the optimal ordering and markdown decisions and show that markdowns, if adopted appropriately, do not necessarily destroy the stability of a business even in the presence of strategic consumers. Furthermore, the consumers' reference exhibits a mean reverting pattern under certain conditions; that is, the reference fluctuates around a mean value, reflecting the practice of most stable businesses. We conduct numerical studies to investigate the impact of consumer learning about the reference price and various system parameters on the retailer\u2019s optimal strategies and profitability in the presence of strategic consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1440","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and inventory strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The challenge faced by the retailer is to construct a fulfillment policy to decide from which facility each of the items in the arriving order should be fulfilled, in a way that minimizes the expected total shipping costs of fulfilling customer orders over a finite horizon. Shipping costs are linear in the size of the package shipped as well as the distance from the facility to the customer. We approximate the stochastic control formulation, which is computationally intractable, with a deterministic linear program (DLP) whose size is polynomial in the size of the input. We then study the performance of two fulfillment heuristics derived from the solution of the DLP. The first heuristic implements the solution of the DLP as fulfillment probability for each item. Since fulfillment decision for each item is made independently of fulfillment decision of other items in the same order, this heuristic does not have a satisfactory performance. The second heuristic improves the first heuristic by allowing fulfillment consolidation across different items in the same order. We do this by modifying the DLP solution through a carefully constructed correlated rounding (or coupling) among the decision variables. We provide a theoretical upper bound on the asymptotic competitive ratio of both heuristics with respect to the optimal policy. Our numerical experiments show that the second heuristic performs very close to optimal for a wide range of problem parameters.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1441","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of order fulfillment and optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

A major challenge of the approach lies in solving the resulting approximate linear programs (ALPs), which often have a huge number of constraints and/or variables. We show that the ALPs can be dramatically reduced in size for both affine and separable piecewise linear approximations to network revenue management problems, under both independent and discrete choice models of demand. Our key result is the equivalence between each ALP and a corresponding reduced program, which is more compact in size and admits an intuitive probabilistic interpretation. For the affine approximation to network revenue management under an independent demand model, we recover an equivalence result known in the literature, but provide an alternative proof. Our other equivalence results are new.

However, building transmission lines that instantaneously deliver all geographically distributed wind energy can be costly. Energy storage (ES) systems can help reduce the cost of bridging wind farms and grids and mitigate the intermittency of wind outputs. In this paper, we propose models of transmission network planning with colocation of ES systems. Our models determine the sizes and sites of ES systems as well as the associated topology and capacity of the transmission network under the feed-in-tariff policy instrument. We first formulate a location model as a mixed-integer second-order-conic program to solve for the ES-transmission network design with uncapacitated storage. Then we propose a method to choose ES sizes by deriving a closed-form upper bound. The major insight is that, in most cases, using even small-sized ES systems can significantly reduce the total expected cost, but their marginal values diminish faster than those of the transmission lines as their capacities expand. Despite uncertainties in climate, technologies, and construction costs, the cost-efficient infrastructure layout is remarkably robust. We also identify the major bottleneck cost factors for different forms of ES technologies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1444","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['energy storage', 'transmission', 'cost-efficient infrastructure']","The article discusses energy storage and transmission in the context of wind energy, which aligns with sustainability themes.

A firm needs to procure multiple classes of capacities and then allocate the capacities to satisfy multiple classes of customers that arrive over time. A general upgrading rule is considered, i.e., unmet demand can be satisfied using multistep upgrade. No replenishment is allowed and the firm has to make the allocation decisions without observing future demand. We first characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy, which consists of parallel allocation and then sequential rationing. Specifically, the firm first uses capacity to satisfy the same-class demand as much as possible, then considers possible upgrading decisions in a sequential manner. We also propose a heuristic based on certainty equivalence control to solve the problem. Numerical analysis shows that the heuristic is fast and delivers close-to-optimal profit for the firm. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical studies to derive insights into the problem. It is found that under the proposed heuristic, the value of using sophisticated multistep upgrading can be quite significant; however, using simple approximations for the initial capacity leads to negligible profit loss, which suggests that the firm\u2019s profit is not sensitive to the initial capacity decision if the optimal upgrading policy is used.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1446","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity management and upgrading without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a large-scale bibliometric database containing 198,310 papers published 1975\u20132012 in the field of operations research (OR), we propose prediction models of whether a scholar would perform well on a number of future success metrics using statistical models trained with data from the scholar\u2019s first five years of publication, a subset of the information available to tenure committees. These models, which use network centrality of the citation network, coauthorship network, and a dual network combining the two, significantly outperform simple predictive models based on citation counts alone. Using a data set of the 54 scholars who obtained a Ph.D. after 1995 and held an assistant professorship at a top-10 OR program in 2003 or earlier, these statistical models, using data up to five years after the scholar became an assistant professor and constrained to tenure the same number of candidates as tenure committees did, made a different decision than the tenure committees for 16 (30%) of the candidates. This resulted in a set of scholars with significantly better future A-journal paper counts, citation counts, and h-indexes than the scholars actually selected by tenure committees.

Integrating the group transitions literature with theory and research on the mood-as-input theory, I propose that shared team mood influences the extent to which team members seek out and experiment with alternative ways of completing their work at different points in a team\u2019s life. In the first half of the team\u2019s life, when team members are relatively task-focused, I argue that team positive mood (i.e., a positively valenced affective state shared by team members at a given point in time) stimulates, whereas team negative mood (i.e., a negatively valenced affective state shared by team members) suppresses, exploratory search. At the temporal midpoint, however, when team members\u2019 focus on performance heightens, team positive mood acts as a shutoff switch for search, leading to a decline in exploratory search over the second half of the team\u2019s life. Team negative mood at the midpoint, on the other hand, leads team members to persist in exploratory search, even as a deadline draws near. A team\u2019s trajectory of exploratory search over time, I propose, influences team performance such that it is highest when teams engage in high exploratory search early in the team\u2019s life and decline in exploratory search over the second half of the team\u2019s life.

Shadow of the future theorists suggest that when an alliance has an explicitly set short-term time frame, there is an increased risk that partners may behave opportunistically. This does not readily explain the high incidence of time-bound alliances being formed. Reconciling insights from the shadow of the future perspective with nascent research on the flexibility of temporary organizations, and shifting the focus from the level of individual transactions to that of strategic alliance portfolios, we argue that firms may be willing to accept a higher risk of opportunism when there are offsetting gains in strategic flexibility in managing their strategic alliance portfolio. Consequently, we hypothesize that environmental factors that increase the need for strategic flexibility\u2014namely, dynamism and complexity in the environment\u2014are likely to increase the relative share of time-bound alliances in strategic alliance portfolios. Our analysis of longitudinal data on the intertemporal alliance choices of a large sample of small and medium-sized enterprises provides support for this argument.

Specifically, we consider the case of alliances between resource-rich and resource-poor firms and examine the capability development opportunities and threats that face the resource-poor focal firm as by-products of a link alliance.

Based on 94 interviews we conducted with a wide variety of employees who witnessed or undertook courageous actions, we inductively developed a model using employees' accounts of the unfolding sequence of events. We learned that employees report engaging in courageous workplace actions when they feel responsible for dealing with a challenging situation such as a workplace error, an abuse of power, an ambiguous situation, or someone in need. We interpreted the stories of courage as suggesting that workplace courage may be a two-stage process, where actors first determine their level of personal responsibility to respond to the challenging situation and then determine the potential social costs of acting. Our model of the courageous workplace action appears to challenge the conventional wisdom of courage as being attributed to a person\u2019s disposition, may enrich theories of intrinsic motivation, and may help clarify the role of cognition in courageous action. Our findings may also help to resolve some of the contradictory evidence regarding the antecedents of the many organizational constructs related to courage including whistle-blowing, voice, speaking up, taking charge, positive deviance, and organizational dissent.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0928","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['courage', 'organizational dissent', 'whistle-blowing', 'responsibility']","The article discusses themes of workplace courage and organizational dissent, which relate to ethical behavior and responsibility in the workplace.

This shock entailed not only an increase in aggregate demand but, more importantly, a shift in the relative attractiveness of individual product areas, resulting in the need for firms to reshuffle their product portfolios in response to changing demand conditions. The exogenous nature of the shock allows us to empirically identify the effect of preshock interdependence structures on postshock adaptation outcomes. We find that the locus of coordination inside a firm can explain differential postshock adaptation performance: because interdependencies spanning organizational boundaries are more difficult to manage than those contained within such boundaries, coordination across product areas creates greater adaptation challenges compared with coordination within product areas. We further investigate the moderating effects of product complementarity and organizational grouping, finding results consistent with our hypothesized mechanisms. As one of the first studies to empirically link a firm\u2019s locus of coordination with its adaptation performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of interdependence and organization design in dynamic environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0929","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of organizational adaptation in response to market changes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By analyzing patent data, we find that the utility of ethnic knowledge and collaborators depends on the level of inventor embeddedness in the community. Most inventors benefit by sourcing knowledge from, or collaborating with, other Indians and hence enhance innovation quality, but at a diminishing rate. For those who are very heavily embedded in the community, ethnic community knowledge decreases the quality of innovation.

This paper identifies three performance issues that naturally result from diversity and suggests a potential solution for each of them. First, the positive effects associated with diversity often decay over time, in part because heterogeneous people may homogenize with repeated exposure. Second, diverse groups are fragile and experience higher turnover than nondiverse groups. Recruiting similar (redundant) pairs within a heterogeneous group can solve these two problems but also gives rise to a third: fault-line fragmentation. We propose a different structural solution: redundant heterogeneity (RH), in which not only are team members heterogeneous within a hierarchical level of a group or organization but their diversity is matched by similar critical team member characteristics at other hierarchical levels. Thus, we suggest that organizations and teams can take maximal advantage of diversity when each of their hierarchical subgroups are similarly diverse on the same critical dimensions. Analyses of 23 years of panel data from the National Basketball Association provided a first test of the effectiveness of this solution. We focused on professional players\u2019 experience with a particular style of play in their college careers as the critical dimension of diversity within these teams. Our findings indicate that RH led to better performance, for three reasons. First, the positive effect of heterogeneity among teams\u2019 core players on team performance decays more slowly for teams with RH; second, teams with RH are less negatively affected by turnover among core players; and third, teams with RH exhibited more coordination and cooperation.

What enables such blends to earn approval and become recognized as new categories? We argue that reactions to category blending are affected by both micro and macro factors. Specifically, blend reactions are affected at the micro level by cognitive limits, especially as blends are repeated, and at the macro level by domain-specific logics for judging quality. Using data on nanotechnology patents, we test this argument by analyzing two dimensions of approval: time to approval and citations by subsequent patents. In addition to showing that blending has different effects on these two dimensions of approval, our findings suggest that reactions to blending are moderated, as argued, by (1) institutional logics that value novel combinations and (2) the repetition of blends that came to define nanotechnology.

Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of supervisory responsibilities, is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U.S. multinational manufacturers in 1996\u20132008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions are more likely to be supervised by foreign rather than domestic supervisory units. Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents\u2019 global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination. The paper highlights one of the most unique features of MNCs: a multinational hierarchy that resides within a firm\u2019s boundary but across national borders.

I advance a process-based explanation for evaluative outcomes. Individuals make evaluations as a result of relative judgments on a subset of objects, comparing each object under consideration against a small set of others. Categorical boundaries matter to individuals perhaps because of personal preferences but also, importantly, because fit within boundaries determines how strictly to apply performance results. Simply by different individuals examining different subsets of objects, evaluative outcomes can vary dramatically, such that the same object may have different evaluations by audience members. Using recommendations by analysts at U.S. brokerages, I find support for the hypothesis that lower performance of a stock relative to other stocks already rated by a given analyst is associated with a lower likelihood of a high rating by an analyst, but this effect applies only to those stocks that fit clearly into industry boundaries. In general, the results suggest that the positive effect of category membership on evaluative outcomes, well established in prior literature, is contingent on the evaluative processes of individual audience members.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0908","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['classification', 'evaluative outcomes', 'performance']","The article focuses on technical aspects of classification and performance evaluation in finance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Prior efforts at providing a unified theory that can accommodate these patterns as special cases have not dealt properly with obsolescence. We tackle this problem by proposing a new model that builds on the most recent unification attempt while integrating the core intuition behind obsolescence: organizations have trouble adapting to drifting environments, which leads to declining performance and, in turn, to decreasing viability. In doing so, we develop a comprehensive representational framework to precisely characterize obsolescence. Our perspective builds on recent theory and research that treats categories as constructions by audiences. We characterize environmental drift as changing audience tastes in a multidimensional feature space and organizational inertia as a decreasing ability for producers to move quickly in that space. This combination creates obsolescence with aging. We then integrate this perspective with prior theory to make novel predictions regarding the age dependence in life chances over the life courses of organizations. We also show how the predictions of our theory can be tested empirically by adapting Levinthal\u2019s random walk model [Levinthal DA (1991) Random walks and organizational mortality. Admin. Sci.

We ask the question of which of these drivers is more pronounced as an explanation of employee entrepreneurship and what technological factors matter in this relationship. Analyzing a unique data set, we find that the likelihood of employee entrepreneurship increases with the inventor\u2019s assessment of the value of a patent for an invention developed while at the incumbent firm but dramatically decreases when the invention protected by the patent is commercialized by the firm, licensed to third parties, interdependent with other firms\u2019 inventions protected by patents, or technologically broad. We also find that conditional on high valuation by the inventor, a matching high valuation by the firm further increases the likelihood of transitioning to entrepreneurship. In combination, we show that a situation when both the inventor and the firm consider the invention valuable but the firm ends up not commercializing the invention is more predictive of employee entrepreneurship than simple differences in assessing the value of the invention.

Rather, we argue that the social category \u201cwomen\u201d can evoke more sensitive behavior from others such that men as well as women contribute to an increase in sensitivity in mixed-gender interactions. We further argue that the presence of women may trigger increased sensitivity such that men can also be the recipients of more sensitivity when one or more women are present on a team. In a study of 202 management consultants, we found that the willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity increased in interactions with women. Moreover, this effect was greater in interactions with women who had low reward power\u2014i.e., females who better fit the expectations associated with the social category \u201cwomen.\u201d We also found team-level effects. Professionals working with mixed-gender versus all-male client teams reported a greater willingness to act with interpersonally sensitive behavior toward male client team members. Our findings show that the willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity is context dependent and shed light on the importance of studying interaction partner-level and team-level effects on willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0941","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['gender', 'interpersonal sensitivity', 'mixed-gender', 'sensitivity', 'social category']","The article explores the influence of gender composition on interpersonal sensitivity in professional settings, highlighting themes of gender dynamics and sensitivity, which align with DEI principles.

We hypothesize that knowledge hoarding increases an individual\u2019s job performance by enhancing bargaining power and influence, whereas perceived hoarding decreases the individual\u2019s job performance because coworkers withdraw social support. We further suggest that knowledge hoarding and perceived hoarding are both detrimental to unit performance because they hurt work-related interactions and impair the unit\u2019s ability to respond quickly to problems. Using a sample of 297 individuals embedded in 41 units in the U.S. Forest Service, we find that the positive effect of hoarding on individual performance is mediated by bargaining power, whereas the negative effect of perceived hoarding on individual performance is mediated by social support. In addition, individual hoarding and perceived hoarding both diminish unit performance.

Prior research on coordination in temporary groups describes how roles encode individual responsibilities so that coordination between relative strangers is possible. We extend this research by introducing key tenets from team effectiveness research to theorize when role-based coordination might be more or less effective. We develop these ideas in a multimethod study of a hospital emergency department (ED) redesign. Before the redesign, people coordinated in ad hoc groupings, which provided flexibility because any nurse could work with any doctor, but these groupings were limited in effectiveness because people were not accountable to each other for progress, did not have shared understanding of their work, and faced interpersonal risks when reaching out to other roles. The redesign introduced new mesolevel structures that bounded a set of roles (rather than a set of specific individuals, as in a team) and gave them collective responsibility for a whole task. We conceptualized the mesolevel structures as team scaffolds and found that they embodied the logic of both role and team structures. The team scaffolds enabled small-group interactions to take the form of an actual team process with team-level prioritizing, updating, and helping, based on newfound accountability, overlapping representations of work, and belonging\u2014despite the lack of stable team composition. Quantitative data revealed changes to the coordination patterns in the ED (captured through a two-mode network) after the team scaffolds were implemented and showed a 40% improvement in patient throughput time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0947","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['coordination', 'responsibility', 'belonging']","The article discusses coordination and accountability within temporary groups, which touches on themes of responsibility and belonging.

From a theoretical perspective, we develop propositions related to microlevel processes that lead to the institutionalization of new rules or those that leave existing arrangements unchanged. Our analysis suggests that traditional social explanations, such as organizational reproduction and copying successful peers, are less likely to drive emergence-based institutionalization than cognitive factors that direct individuals to anticipate and preempt the actions of others.

We argue that structural recombination is both a means for firms to unlock the potential for intraorganizational knowledge recombination and a source of disruption to the firm\u2019s existing knowledge resources, so that the overall effect of structural recombination on innovation will depend on the balance between these two effects. Structural recombination will have a positive effect on innovation where there are substantial intraorganizational knowledge synergies, where path dependence is low, and where knowledge resources are of high quality, limiting disruption. Results from a 20-year panel of 71 firms operating in the U.S. medical sector confirm these arguments.

Despite the strong theoretical argument regarding the value-enhancing role of alliance experience, past research has reported mixed results. In an attempt to resolve the inconclusive findings, we provide a more fine-grained view of alliance experience by examining characteristics such as relatedness and diversity, which are defined based on the functional focus and the industry of the partner. Furthermore, we argue that since leveraging alliance experience is a learning process, a firm\u2019s knowledge integration capabilities enabled by information technology (IT) should influence the extent to which the firm benefits from alliance experience. Using data from 1,030 alliances made by 89 firms across 11 industries, we test the effects of relatedness and diversity on abnormal returns following alliance announcements. We find that functionally related experience is positively related to abnormal returns, whereas partner industry-based related experience affects the expected value negatively. We also find that a firm\u2019s IT-enabled knowledge integration positively moderates the effects of both related and diverse experience on abnormal returns. Our findings highlight that although knowledge gained through prior experience is important, complementary capabilities that enable firms to leverage and utilize such knowledge are also necessary for ex ante value creation in alliances.

The Comparative Effects of Ostracism and Harassment at Work","Ostracism has been recognized as conceptually and empirically distinct from harassment. Drawing from theory and research that suggests that employees have a strong need to belong in their organizations, we examine the comparative frequency and impact of ostracism and harassment in organizations across three field studies. Study 1 finds that a wide range of employees perceive ostracism, compared with harassment, to be more socially acceptable, less psychologically harmful, and less likely to be prohibited in their organization. Study 2 surveyed employees from a variety of organizations to test our theory that ostracism is actually a more harmful workplace experience than harassment. Supporting our predictions, compared with harassment, ostracism was more strongly and negatively related to a sense of belonging and to various measures of employee well-being and work-related attitudes. We also found that the effects of ostracism on well-being and work-related attitudes were at least partially mediated by a sense of belonging. Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 with data collected from employees of a large organization and also investigated the comparative impact of ostracism and harassment on employee turnover. Ostracism, but not harassment, significantly predicted actual turnover three years after ostracism and harassment were assessed, and this was mediated by a sense of belonging (albeit at p < 0.10).

We suggest that firms\u2019 interorganizational learning is embedded in their macrolevel country contexts, characterized by more corporatist versus less corporatist (pluralist) institutional logics. Whereas corporatism spurs coordinated approaches, pluralism engenders competitive interactions that affect the extent to which firms span organizational and technological boundaries and learn from each other. We test our theory using longitudinal analysis of 181 dyads involving 26 firms participating in 17 SSOs in the global mobile handset industry. We find that interorganizational learning, as measured by patent citations, involving corporatist firm dyads significantly increases when the dominant logic within the arena is also corporatist. By making cooperative schemas more accessible, a dominant corporatist logic also enhances interorganizational learning across technologically distant dyads. When a pluralist logic dominates the arena, corporatist dyads learn less because firms in the dyad activate a contradictory logic that decouples them from their natural processes for interorganizational learning. These findings highlight the implications of institutional logics for interorganizational learning outcomes and provide insights into how firms attend to institutional contradictions in arenas that provide opportunities for interorganizational learning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0940","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional logics', 'interorganizational learning', 'corporatism', 'pluralism']","The article discusses institutional logics and their impact on interorganizational learning, which hints at broader social structures but lacks a direct focus on social justice or equity themes.

Despite i-deals\u2019 potential to benefit both employees and employers, economic theory asserts that employers attempt to reduce individual contracting by use of internal labor markets (ILMs). This study identifies limits to that assertion by identifying conditions under which i-deals are sought, despite employee participation in ILMs. Furthermore, we develop and test theory reconciling the roles of ILMs and firm-specific human capital in employee requests for i-deals. Employee reports of ILM practices are negatively related to i-deal requests, whereas firm-specific human capital is positively related to these requests. In addition, we find an interaction between the two such that the suppressive effects of ILM reports on i-deal requests hold largely for workers with low firm-specific human capital. Individuals with high firm-specific human capital tend to seek i-deals despite reported ILM practices. I-deal requests also increase with group-level heterogeneity in firm-specific human capital. In all, our findings suggest that ILMs function as economic theory asserts for workers with limited firm-specific human capital, but they are less able to reduce i-deal requests among workers with higher firm-specific human capital.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0955","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['employee participation', 'idiosyncratic deals', 'firm-specific human capital']","The article discusses employee participation and the concept of idiosyncratic deals, which touches on individual employee needs and preferences, hinting at a moderate focus on employee equity.

In developing such a conceptual framework, it is necessary to distinguish between the underlying stable roots of behavior and the possibly adaptive expression of those underlying templates. Selection occurs over expressed behavior. As a result, plasticity, the capacity to adapt behavior, poses a trade-off as it offers the possibility of adaptive learning but at the same time mitigates the effectiveness of selection processes to identify more or less superior underlying roots of behavior. In addition, plasticity may mitigate the reliability with which practices are enacted. These issues are explored in the context of a computational model, which examines the interrelationship among processes of variation, selection, and plasticity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0956","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['adaptation', 'selection', 'plasticity']","The article discusses organizational adaptation mechanisms but lacks a focus on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

It provides exploratory quantitative evidence for the way in which conditions within the segments of a sector\u2019s value chain affect the profitability of those segments compared with the sector as a whole. To consider how value shifts from one part of the sector (such as computer assemblers) to another (such as software and microprocessor makers), we look at how conditions within a segment (such as software developers) affect changes in the value share of that segment compared with the entire sector in terms of market capitalization. We find that the presence of what we call \u201ckingpins\u201d\u2014firms with superior capabilities, modeled in our study as having superior market capitalization and as being disproportionately important in terms of research and development (R&D)\u2014is correlated with a higher share of total sector value, suggesting that kingpins can help a segment to become a \u201cbottleneck.\u201d Sales concentration and the level of R&D expenditure are not always reliable predictors.

Our framework regards organizations as points in multidimensional metric spaces of architectures. Organizational change means movement in this space. The speed of change is the ratio of the distance between positions in a space and the time it took for the organization to make the move. We illustrate how our distance-based approach can be used to formulate theories of age-related organizational inertia by using this representation to develop a model for a possible mechanism: age-related cultural resistance to change based on the dynamics of exposure of organizational members to architectural features. Our proposed mechanism is distinct from prevailing explanations and leads to new predictions.

To understand how actors navigate through ethical complexity, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry into the multistakeholder practices of setting Fairtrade Minimum Prices. We offer three contributions. First, we develop a process model of ethics as sensemaking that explains how actors come to collectively agree on what is ethical in complex situations, even if no complete consensus arises.

Although valuable, such dispersion also increases communication and coordination costs, making it difficult to utilize this information in developing new knowledge. To resolve this theoretical dilemma, we investigate the conditions that alter the effect of team members\u2019 geographic dispersion on innovative novelty. Based on an investigation of 7,162 scientific teams in the biotechnology sector between 1973 and 1999, we argue and demonstrate that the degree of teams\u2019 innovative novelty is curvilinear: it increases and then decreases as the geographic dispersion of the team members increases. We also establish that the effect of geographic dispersion on the novelty of a team\u2019s innovation depends on the team\u2019s social environment. The greater the relational strength among research and development team members, the stronger the initial positive effect of their geographic dispersion, and the weaker the negative effect at higher levels of dispersion. Furthermore, the greater the status asymmetry in a team, the weaker the initial positive effect of geographic dispersion, and the stronger the negative effect at high levels of dispersion. These results offer insights into the social mechanisms that can facilitate the realization of the potential embedded in dispersed teams to generate novel innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0969","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['diverse', 'geographic dispersion', 'relational strength', 'status asymmetry', 'innovation']","The article discusses the impact of geographic dispersion and relational dynamics on innovation, touching on themes of diversity and social structures within teams.

This massive increase in alliance activity caused the crystallization of a giant component in the global technology network that connected a large portion of the world\u2019s firms, government labs, universities, and other organizations. However, when alliance activity declined, the component disintegrated. What caused this spike in alliance activity? And did this large-but-transient change in collaboration activity leave any enduring effect? The data here suggest that a major technology shock may have provoked this alliance surge. A technology shock may simultaneously unleash significant innovation opportunities while creating great uncertainty in the economic environment. Though it is well known that firms often use alliances both to respond to uncertainty and facilitate innovation, little is known about how technology shocks affect the collaboration behavior of firms and how these two factors separately influence innovation outcomes. I integrate an inductive study of collaboration activity and a technology shock with existing research on economics, alliances, and networks to build a set of arguments about how technology shocks will influence alliance behavior, how changes in alliance behavior will influence the global technology collaboration network, and about how each of these changes is likely to influence the innovative outcomes of firms. I then explore the separate and joint effects of the technology shock and collaboration activity on innovation using a large sample panel study of patenting by North American firms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0970","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technology alliances and innovation outcomes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we observe that the literature on individual differences and social networks focuses almost exclusively on ego\u2019s views of herself and of her network. Our approach complements this egocentric perspective with a more altercentric view, in which others\u2019 perceptions of and reactions to ego\u2019s personality and relational behavior shape the structure of ego\u2019s network. Our altercentric perspective builds on earlier evidence that the construct of self-monitoring is associated with brokerage, but it suggests that the effect of self-monitoring on brokerage is amplified in those perceived as highly empathic and attenuated in those perceived as lower in empathy. A mechanism that underlies this effect is the greater propensity of others to reciprocate the social interactions of high-empathy, high self-monitors than those low in empathy. We find support for these predictions in a study of the dynamic emergence of a social network among a complete cohort of MBA students and conclude that alters are active agents in the formation of ego\u2019s network.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0961","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['empathy', 'social networks', 'altercentric', 'self-monitoring']","The article discusses the role of empathy in social networks, which aligns with themes of social awareness and interpersonal relationships.

To understand the flaring of intellectual outliers, we use archival and interview data from the RAND Corporation after the Second World War. We focus on five factors important to the RAND experience: (1) a belief in fundamental research as a source of practical ideas, (2) a culture of optimistic urgency, (3) the solicitation of renegade ambition, (4) the recruitment of intellectual cronies, and (5) the facilitation of the combinatorics of variety. To understand the subsequent decline of intellectual outliers at RAND, we note that success yields a sense of competence, endurance in a competitive world, and the opportunity and inclination to grow. Self-confidence, endurance, and growth produce numerous positive consequences for an organization; but for the most part, they undermine variety. Outliers and the conditions that produce them are not favored by their environments. Engineering solutions to this problem involve extending time and space horizons, providing false information about the likelihoods of positive returns from exploration, buffering exploratory activities from the pressures of efficiency, and protecting exploration from analysis by connecting it to dictates of identities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0962","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['intellectual outliers', 'variety', 'exploration']","The article discusses the concept of intellectual outliers and the conditions that foster or hinder their emergence, which touches on themes of diversity in thought and innovation.

We challenge this assumption of an inevitable charismatic bias toward men leaders. We propose that gender-biased attributions about the charismatic leadership of men and women are facilitated by the operation of a leader-in-social-network schema. Attributions of charismatic leadership depend on the match between the gender of the leader and the perceived structure of the network. In three studies encompassing both experimental and survey data, we show that when team advice networks are perceived to be centralized around one or a few individuals, women leaders are seen as less charismatic than men leaders. However, when networks are perceived to be cohesive (many connections among individuals), it is men who suffer a charismatic leadership disadvantage relative to women.

The Emergent Charter Definition Process","Ambidexterity research has presented a range of structural and contextual approaches for implementing a dual orientation across organizations. Much less is known about the preceding process through which organizations decide to adopt an ambidextrous orientation. In this paper we focus on this first step\u2014the charter definition process through which the activities and responsibilities of an organizational unit are agreed. Most prior studies implicitly assume that senior executives at some point identify the need to become ambidextrous and subsequently design supportive structures and contexts to implement their choice. Based on an inductive multilevel case study of four alliances, we show how this mandated (or top-down) charter definition process can be complemented with an alternative emergent (or bottom-up) charter definition process in which frontline managers take the initiative to adopt an ambidextrous orientation in their part of the organization. This emergent process is important because it enables frontline managers to respond in a timely manner to changing requirements of which senior executives are still unaware. We use the findings from our case study to develop potentially generalizable observations on the level of initiation, the tensions, the management approaches to deal with the tensions, and the outcomes that characterize this emergent charter definition process. We then put forward a multilevel process framework of how organizations initiate an ambidextrous orientation, and we discuss theoretical implications for the general ambidexterity literature, the nascent dynamic view on ambidexterity, and the broader research on how charters in organizations evolve.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0971","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['ambidexterity', 'emergent', 'frontline managers']","The article discusses organizational processes and managerial roles but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Drawing on theoretical mechanisms from the social network and knowledge transfer literature, as well as on recent empirical advances in exponential random graphs models of social networks, we examine how the presence of a common third party in the communication network affects the likelihood of technical communication between interdependent teams designing the components of a large commercial aircraft engine. Although task interdependence has a strong and significant effect on the likelihood of communication between teams, this effect is moderated by the presence of common third parties. The nature of this moderation depends on the position of the common third party within the triadic communication structure. When the common third party seats in the middle of a communication chain between the potential source and the potential recipient of technical communication, its presence increases the likelihood of communication between these two teams. However, when the communication between the source and recipient can trigger cyclic exchanges between the three teams, the presence of the third party reduces the likelihood of communication between the two interdependent teams, increasing the risk of coordination disruptions.

My field study of a consulting firm demonstrated that although some people easily embrace this expected identity, for others, it conflicts with their experienced professional identity.

Analyzing 115 interviews, performance evaluations, and turnover data, I trace how and why people manage their deviance differently across audiences within the organization, show the interdependence of these efforts, and illuminate consequences for how they are perceived and evaluated. In the firm I studied, although both men and women strayed, men were more likely than women to pass.

Yet, surprising in light of the wealth of research on social networks and job attainment, we do not have a unified model of the impact of different kinds of social contacts on job search success. In this paper I show that contacts are differently beneficial for job seekers depending on the stage of the job search process that job seekers are engaged in. Specifically, three stages of the job search process can be distinguished in which social contacts fulfill different roles for the job seekers: deciding the types of jobs for which to apply, submitting job applications, and preparing for interviews. I propose that contacts who are spread across different occupations are conducive to applying to more types of jobs, yet it is contacts who are more focused across occupations that are beneficial for being invited to more interviews\u2014relative to the number of job types applied for\u2014and for converting the interviews into offers. In addition, contacts with lower relationship depth with the job seeker are more helpful for getting invited to interviews, whereas contacts who have more frequent interactions with the job seeker are more helpful for converting interviews into offers. Analyses using a unique longitudinal data set on the job searches of 226 participants in an MBA program offer robust evidence in support of the hypotheses.

In sync with more recent studies focusing on specific dimensions of change, in this paper we borrow theoretical elements from systems theory to examine the possibility that the reward to developing innovative product components may itself be eroded by implicit and yet burgeoning costs to fit the new component technology into existing architectures, thereby dampening system performance. Specifically, we theoretically assess how varying magnitudes of industry regulatory changes affect the optimum level of firm exploration, and propose\u2014counterintuitively vis-\u00e0-vis past literature\u2014that the more radical (i.e., competence destroying), as opposed to incremental (i.e., competence enhancing), these changes are, the more the optimum intensity of firm exploration recedes. Based on quantitative as well as qualitative empirical analyses from the Formula One racing industry, we precisely trace the observed performance outcomes back to the underlying logic of our theory, stressing that impaired capabilities to integrate the new component in the architecture redesign and time-based cognitive limitations both operate to inhibit the otherwise positive relationship between firm exploration and performance.

By adopting a narrative approach, we show the shared sensemaking of such a team to be impacted by the locally differentiated nature of its interpretive and relational contexts, leading to context specific interpretations of center-led change and locally distinct responses, with consequences for change outcomes. We found that because of their dual role, senior managers construct two sets of interwoven and interacting change narratives which mediate the relationship between the wider organizational change and local change actions.

Categories without well-defined boundaries typically are not useful and so are expected to fade away.

We argue that this fact can be explained by looking at market categories from the producer perspective. Lenient market categories have more flexibility and allow for a wider range of fit. As a result, we expect to see high rates of entry into lenient categories. At the same time, lenient market categories have drawbacks: they do not clearly convey what an organization does and do not identify specific sets of potential consumers. This means organizations are more likely to exit. When entry rates are higher than exit rates, lenient market categories will endure over time. We also predict that organizations exiting lenient categories will enter other lenient categories, further fueling the persistence of such categories. Finally, this trend is exaggerated when influential external agents favor leniency.

Surprisingly, unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

Problem solving, we argue, involves both exploration for information and exploration for solutions. Our results show that network clustering has opposite effects for these two important and complementary forms of exploration. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more diverse information but discourages them from generating diverse theories; that is, clustering promotes exploration in information space but decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, generally focusing on only one of those two spaces at a time, has produced an inconsistent understanding of the value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which information was measured separately from solutions, we bring disparate results under a single theoretical roof and clarify the effects of network clustering on problem-solving behavior and performance.

The model represents how members of a collective interact to interpret their environment. Current theories of collective interpretation focus on how heedful communication among members of a collective (i.e., how much individuals pay attention to others\u2019 interpretations) improves interpretive performance; their general assumption is that heed tends to be uniformly beneficial. By unpacking the micromechanisms that underlie such performance, our model reveals a more complex story. Heedfulness can benefit interpretive performance. It can help collectives properly interpret situations that are especially ambiguous, unknown, or novel. Conversely, heedfulness also generates conformity pressures that induce agents to give too much weight to others\u2019 interpretations, even if erroneous, thereby potentially degrading interpretive performance. These two effects join into a nonmonotonic trajectory that represents how heed relates to interpretive performance: due to its beneficial properties, performance increases with heed until it peaks before degrading due to conformity pressures. The form of this nonmonotonic relationship is contingent on the nature of the task: ambiguous situations make collectives vulnerable to too much heed: ambiguity ignites conformism; novel situations make collectives dependent on heed: novelty requires multiple eyes to be seen. In addition to these results, our model offers a flexible platform that future work can use to explore collective interpretation in a variety of organizational and supraorganizational contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0987","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['collective', 'interpretation', 'heedfulness', 'conformity']","The article discusses collective interpretation and the dynamics of heedfulness and conformity, which touch on themes of group behavior and decision-making.

Drawing from the alliance management capabilities literature, we argue that firms with more alliance experience are better able to protect their interests under any given alliance structure, making the choice of structure less consequential to them. The resulting governance versatility provides a competitive advantage by enabling firms to form advantageous alliances that are less available to inexperienced competitors. Our study of innovative alliances in biopharmaceutical industry lends support to the hypotheses, allowing us to advance the literature on governance choice in alliances, the literature on alliance management, and their intersection.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0989","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the structural and governance aspects of alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We theorize that given the unique structure and complex form of business group organizations, the search behavior of affiliated firms is influenced by the degree of (mis)alignment in outlook at the group and affiliate levels of management. We identify the scope of institutional changes, business group attributes, and affiliate characteristics as sources of such (mis)alignment. The results from panel data on 298 firms from the Indian pharmaceutical industry for the 1992\u20132007 period show that the constraining effects of business group affiliation are observed only when institutional changes are specific to the affiliates\u2019 industry and not when broad institutional changes affect the business group as a whole. Moreover, we observe heterogeneity in the search behavior of group affiliated firms. First, the degree of misalignment is greater in the case of affiliates belonging to older business groups and those that are more distant in terms of age and industry since the group\u2019s founding. Second, by contrast and suggesting an alignment in outlook, we find that affiliated firms that occupy a prominent position within a group or industry are able to bargain for and receive attention and support from the business group to undertake international search. Our findings have implications for research on the role of business groups in a changing institutional context and for the strategic adaptation of firms embedded in complex organizational and institutional settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0990","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['institutional changes', 'business group', 'affiliated firms']","The article primarily focuses on the strategic behavior of firms within business groups during institutional transitions, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

This relational demography can lead to poor affiliative outcomes at work when individuals are assigned to work together. However, relationships between dissimilar individuals that occur by choice and develop naturally over time may be of higher quality than those that occur due to structural causes, such as being put together in a work group. In this study, we focus on racial dissimilarity in choice relationships both outside and inside of work and find that greater racial heterogeneity in choice relationships outside of work is related to positive affiliative outcomes at work, such as trust in supervisor and extra-role behaviors, through its effects on relationships inside of the workplace. This has implications for the research on choice and relational demography in organizations, suggesting that relational demography that is a function of choice has benefits for affiliative outcomes at work and that relational demography that is a function of assignment or structure does not.

Yet two key research questions remain unanswered: which of a person\u2019s many dormant ties provide the most value, and which are advice seekers most inclined to choose as reconnection targets? In the current study, we asked executives to seek advice on an important work project from two dormant ties (their first, most preferred choice plus one selected randomly from their next nine most preferred choices) and to respond to surveys before and after their reconnections. This two-stage design allowed us to make causal inferences about the executives\u2019 advice-seeking preferences and the value of reconnecting certain types of dormant ties. Our results show that the most valuable reconnections are to people who provide novelty (by not having spent much time together in the past and having higher status) as well as engagement (by being trustworthy and willing to help). Our executive participants, however, preferred neither novelty nor engagement. Rather, the prospect of reconnecting can make people feel anxious. To avoid this discomfort, executives preferred contacts with whom they had spent a lot of time together in the past, thereby actually reducing novelty. Thus, our findings identify critical biases in executives\u2019 reconnection preferences as well as insights into how to make more effective reconnections.

Many new markets emerge in direct ideological opposition to incumbent industries. Yet, the ways in which ideology affects products in oppositional markets are not well understood. We propose that when audiences cannot easily differentiate between products based on physical attributes, they rely on ideological discourse about the production process. We argue that product names, by embodying linguistically the narrative of this discourse, shape the appeal of oppositional products to customers. When products have names that are congruent with the collective identity of an oppositional market, they have higher appeal. This beneficial effect is attenuated (1) when audience expectations about what type of product should have an oppositional name are violated and (2) when a firm develops a strong organizational identity and audiences rely on this identity to make inference about the firm\u2019s production process.

One important consequence of these developments is that firms have abdicated their role as a critical risk bearer in society. Although evidence suggests that firms have increasingly shifted market risks onto their workforce, to date, there have been few detailed analyses exploring what factors have driven this phenomenon. This study adds to our understanding of why firms have transferred risk to their employees by examining the decline of a highly institutionalized practice wherein large U.S. firms used to bear retirement risk: the defined benefit (DB) pension plan. Through a detailed analysis, I show that variance in the presence, power, and interests of shareholders and employees at the firm level differentially affect a firm\u2019s willingness to shift the risk of retirement onto its workers. Specifically, I demonstrate empirically that different types of shareholders have differential effects on a firm\u2019s retirement practices, suggesting that the changing equity ownership structure of large U.S. firms has played a key role in how risk is allocated between workers and firms. Declines in employee power have also played a role because firm levels of unionization positively affect rates of DB participation for both unionized and nonunionized workers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.1001","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['risk', 'employees', 'shareholders', 'unionization', 'retirement']","The article discusses the shifting of risk from firms to employees, highlighting the implications for worker welfare and the role of unionization, which aligns with themes of social equity and employee rights.

Our study fills this gap. Using individual-level data for approximately 10,000 employees in a global management consulting firm, we present empirical evidence of a positive retention effect associated with employee participation in a corporate initiative with explicit social impact goals. In addition, we offer arguments for moderating conditions that weaken this relationship and present evidence consistent with our arguments. Further econometric analysis based on a stringent matching approach as well as additional analyses based on survey and interview data suggest that the retention effect can at least partly be attributed to treatment and is not all just a manifestation of sorting of certain types of employees into the social initiative.

To answer calls for more status research at the macro level, this study extends psychological research on assimilation and contrast effects to examine how status inequality as a distributional property influences product choices in markets. In the context of U.S. college bowls (a specific type of organization within U.S. collegiate athletics), this study analyzes how the status inequality among bowls influences bowls\u2019 stadium attendance, which reflects the judgment of bowls by football fans as the key buyers. The analyses yield evidence consistent with assimilation and contrast effects. Below the middle level of status inequality, the relationship between status inequality and stadium attendance is positive for low-status bowls but negative for high-status bowls.

Further, we propose that as participants acquire experience in exchanging knowledge, they learn to rely more on expertise similarity and less on categorical similarities, such as location or hierarchical status.

What we know less about, however, is why they might change back, despite evidence suggesting that this occurs. In this paper, we develop and test a model of organizational oscillation that explains why firms cycle through periods of learning and periods of forgetting. In particular, we identify a dual role for serious errors, which push firms toward a focus on safety while also pulling them away from other foci, such as efficiency or innovation. Although existing learning research recognizes errors as disruptive, this dual effect has not been theorized. We also demonstrate that, over time, the effect of a serious error on safety weakens, allowing alternative activities to emerge that lead to subsequent errors. We draw on qualitative data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Challenger and Columbia accidents to build theory about why organizations oscillate between safety and other foci, and how serious errors trigger these shifts. We then test this theory using a data set of all pharmaceutical firms that introduced Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in the United States from 1997 to 2004.

A variety of empirical findings inconsistent with this explanation demonstrate its inadequacy. Building on Kanter\u2019s observation that recruitment processes often resemble \u201chomosocial reproduction\u201d [Kanter RM (1977) Men and Women of the Corporation (Basic Books, New York)], we develop a population dynamics model of network recruitment. The resulting formal model builds a parsimonious theory regarding the segregating effects of network recruitment, resolving the puzzles and inconsistencies revealed by recent empirical findings. This revised theory also challenges conventional understandings of how network recruitment segregates: in isolation, network recruitment\u2014even with segregated networks\u2014is more likely to desegregate rather than segregate. Network recruitment segregates primarily through its interactions with other supply-side (e.g., gendered self-sorting) or demand-side (e.g., gendered referring rates) biasing mechanisms. Our model reveals whether and to what extent network recruitment segregates or desegregates, and it reveals opportunities for organizational intervention. There is an easily calculable tipping point where demand-side factors such as gender differences in referring can counteract and neutralize other segregating effects from referring. Independent of other personnel practices, organizational policies affecting employees\u2019 referring behaviors can tip the balance to determine whether network recruitment serves as a segregating or desegregating force.

The best resource allocation decisions are investigated with the objectives of minimizing mortality or incidence rates. We provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to policy and disease\u2010related parameters. We conclude that to minimize mortality, the capacity should be rationed to ensure that the wait for diagnosis is at reasonable levels. When the relevant performance measure is the incidence rate, screening is allocated more capacity compared to the case with mortality rate measure.

When the IG's effort increases, does the average ex ante order quantity rise or fall? Do average ex post sales rise or fall? Improvements in information technology and in the services offered by forecasters provide motivation for the study of these questions. Much depends on our model of the IG and his efforts. We study an IG who sends a signal to a classic single\u2010period newsvendor. The signal defines the newsvendor's posterior probability distribution on the possible demands and the newsvendor uses that posterior to calculate the optimal order. Each of the possible posteriors is a scale/location transform of the same base distribution. When the IG works harder, the average scale parameter drops. Higher IG effort is always useful to the newsvendor. We show that there is a critical value of order cost. For costs on one side of this value more IG effort leads to a higher average ex ante order and for costs on the other side to a lower average order. But for all costs, more IG effort leads to higher average ex post sales.

Prior research has shown that supplier encroachment can mitigate double marginalization and thus benefit both the supplier and the reseller. However, under symmetric information, this benefit disappears if the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. In our model, the reseller observes the true market size while the supplier knows only the prior distribution, that is, a seemingly ideal setting for implementing mechanism design through nonlinear pricing. We first show that, because encroachment capability enables the supplier to make an ex post output decision, it fundamentally alters the structure of the optimal nonlinear pricing policy. In addition to the usual downward distortion effect, where the reseller may purchase less than the efficient quantity, we also have the possibility for upward distortion. Thus, under asymmetric information and nonlinear pricing, supplier encroachment has two opposing effects. On one hand, the ability to shift sales to the direct channel allows the supplier to reduce information rents with less sacrifice of efficiency; but on the other hand, by introducing the possibility of her own opportunistic behavior, it can result in upward distortion of the quantities sold through the reselling channel, which is a new source of inefficiency. Depending upon the relative efficiency of the reselling channel and the demand distribution, either of these two effects may dominate and the supplier's ability to encroach may either benefit or hurt both the supplier and the reseller.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12210","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supplier encroachment and nonlinear pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, we show that agencies may be justified in setting daily road user cost strictly smaller than the true cost of traffic disruption during construction.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12217","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['policy implications', 'discretionary parameters', \"contractors' strategies\"]","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of bidding strategies and procurement mechanisms without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We confirm that the revenue\u2010sharing contract can coordinate supply chain decisions including the innovation investment, whereas the other two contracts may result in underinvestment in innovation. However, the downstream manufacturer does not always prefer the revenue\u2010sharing contract; the manufacturer's profit can be higher with a quality\u2010dependent wholesale price contract than with a revenue\u2010sharing contract, specifically when the upstream supplier's innovation cost is low.

By inviting upstream competition, with the wholesale price contract, the manufacturer can increase his profit substantially. Furthermore, under upstream competition, the revenue\u2010sharing contract coordinates the supply chain, and results in an optimal contract form for the manufacturer when suppliers are symmetric.

Focusing on a common type of distribution networks in which multiple distributors serve a single, dominant supplier, this study moves beyond a dyadic view to examine how a focal distributor's relational and structural embeddedness in such a distribution network influences its opportunism toward the dominant supplier. In particular, we postulate that a distributor's relational embeddedness in the network curbs its opportunism, whereas its network centrality, as a form of structural embeddedness in the network, promotes its opportunism. Moreover, we propose that relational embeddedness magnifies the role of a focal distributor's dependence on the supplier in suppressing the distributor's opportunism, whereas network centrality buffers such a role. We first empirically test these hypotheses using data collected from car dealers in China; the results provide support for the hypotheses. We then develop an analytical model to validate and further explain the underlying mechanisms of the network effects. Our analytical results not only validate the empirical results but also provide guidance for managers on controlling opportunism in distribution networks.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12247","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['opportunism', 'network relationships', 'dependence']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of distribution networks and opportunism without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We consider two scenarios that differ in how capacity is used: exclusive capacity and first\u2010priority capacity. We model firms' investment and production decisions, and analyze the equilibrium outcomes in terms of the number of investing firms and capacity levels for each scenario; realized capacity is a stochastic function of investment levels. We also identify conditions under which the spillover effect occurs, where one firm taps into the other firm's invested capacity. Although the spillover supposedly intensifies competition, it actually discourages firms' investment. We also characterize the firms' and supplier's preference about the capacity type. While the non\u2010investing firm always prefers spillovers from the first\u2010priority capacity, the investing firm does not always want to shut off the other firm's access to its leftover capacity, especially when allowing spillover induces the other firm not to invest.

This approach, combined with automatic replenishment systems, leads to reactive inventory control policies where base stock levels are adjusted only after a service contract expires. Consequently, service providers often face excess stock of critical service parts that are difficult to dispose due to their specificity. In this study, we address this problem by developing inventory control policies taking into account contract expirations. Our key idea is to reduce the base stock level of the one\u2010for\u2010one policy before obsolescence (a full or partial drop in demand rate) occurs and let demand take away excess stock. We refer to this policy as the single\u2010adjustment policy. We benchmark the single\u2010adjustment policy with the multiple\u2010adjustment policy (allowing multiple base stock adjustments) formulated as a dynamic program and verify that for a wide range of instances the single\u2010adjustment policy is an effective heuristic for the multiple\u2010adjustment policy. We also compare the single\u2010adjustment policy with the world\u2010dependent base stock policy offered by Song and Zipkin (1993) and identify the parameter combinations where both policies yield similar costs. We consider two special cases of the single\u2010adjustment policy where the base stock level is kept fixed or the base stock adjustment is postponed to the contract expiration time. We find that the initial demand rate, contract expiration time, and size of the drop in demand rate are the three key parameters driving the choice between the single\u2010adjustment policy and its special cases.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12358","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

When a stockout occurs, the firm controls backorders on the basis of certain compensation policies. Customers make decisions to maximize their utility, which is decreasing in the price, the waiting time, and the customer's impatience factor. We assume that the impatience factor is private information held by the customer only. Two compensation mechanisms are designed to control backorders, namely uniform compensation and priority auction with an admission price. Under uniform compensation, the firm offers the same discount to all customers, whereas under auction compensation, priority is granted according to the customers' bid prices. We obtain the optimal stockout price and base stock level under each mechanism, and analyze the properties of the respective optimal policies. Assuming linear waiting costs with uniformly distributed impatience factor, we find that the auction mechanism (1) maintains a lower base stock level and results in greater profit and (2) benefits customers with relatively lower or higher impatience factors, but customers with a medium impatience factor may be rendered worse off. We further show that both compensation mechanisms are suitable for products with a high unit profit, a high lost sales penalty cost, and a high holding cost.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12360","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and compensation mechanisms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This assortment problem under the multinomial logit model with multiple customer types is NP\u2010complete. Although there are heuristics to find good assortments, it is difficult to verify the optimality gap of the heuristics. In this study, motivated by the difficulty of finding optimal solutions and verifying the optimality gap of heuristics, we develop an approach to construct an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue. Our approach can quickly provide upper bounds and these upper bounds can be quite tight. In our computational experiments, over a large set of randomly generated problem instances, the upper bounds provided by our approach deviate from the optimal expected revenues by 0.15% on average and by less than one percent in the worst case.

In some, firms' govern partnering relationships through fixed\u2010price contracts, whereas in others, firms' use more flexible time and materials or performance\u2010based contracts. How do these choices affect the costs and benefits that arise from greater levels of partner integration? Furthermore, how are these relationships affected when the choice of contract is misaligned with the scope and objectives of the partnering relationship? Our study addresses these questions using data from 172 R&D projects that involve partners. We find that, (i) greater partner integration is associated with higher project costs for all contract types; (ii) greater partner integration is associated with higher product quality only in projects that adopt more flexible time and materials or performance\u2010based contracts; and (iii) in projects where the choice of contract is misaligned with the scope and objectives of the partnering relationship, greater partner integration is associated with higher project costs, but not with higher product quality.

We investigate how the supplier can take advantage of the buyer's better forecasts and what kind of contracts he should offer to the buyer in order to maximize his profits. We model a natural forecast evolution where the buyer can obtain a more accurate forecast closer to the selling season. We assume there is information asymmetry between the buyer and the supplier at all times in that the buyer understands her demand better than the supplier. Three types of contracts that the supplier can offer are considered: (1) one where a contract is offered before the buyer has a chance to obtain improved forecasts, (2) one where a contract is offered after the buyer has obtained improved forecasts, and (3) a contingent (dynamic) contract which offers an initial contract to the buyer before she obtains improved forecasts, followed by a later contract (contingent on the initial contract) offered after improved forecasts have been obtained. We consider two scenarios: (1) where the supplier is certain that the buyer can obtain more accurate forecasts over time, and (2) where the supplier is uncertain about the buyer's forecasting capability (or forecasting cost). In the first scenario, we show that among the three types of contracts, the contingent contract is always the most profitable for the supplier. Furthermore, using the contingent contract, the supplier always benefits from higher accuracy of the buyer's demand forecasts. In the second scenario, we explicitly model the supplier's level of certainty about the buyer's capability of obtaining better forecasts, and explore how the supplier can design contracts to induce the buyer to obtain better forecasts when she is capable.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12355","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract design and forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An implication for the JIT approach is that one must reduce setup cost at non\u2010bottlenecks and setup time at bottlenecks to reduce inventory. An implication for the OPT approach is that trade\u2010offs between setup and inventory carrying costs may indeed be ignored while determining process batch sizes, provided each facility in a production system is operating at or above Its critical level. Economic theoretic analysis of the EMO model provides a basis for unification of JIT which advocates stability in operating level as a key to improved productivity and quality, and OPT that advocates maximizing operating level with resultant emphasis on bottlenecks as a key to increased profits.

A comparison between the monopolistic and each of the duopolistic settings reveals that the introduction of competition can hamper a hospital's ability to attain economies of scale and can also increase waiting times. Moreover, the presence of a for\u2010profit sector may be desirable only when the hospital market is sufficiently competitive. A comparison across the duopolistic settings indicates that the choice between homogeneous and heterogeneous competition depends on the patients' willingness to wait before receiving care and the reimbursement level of the non\u2010profit sector. When the public funder is not financially constrained, the presence of a for\u2010profit sector may allow the funder to lower both the financial costs of providing coverage and the total costs to patients. Finally, our analysis suggests that the public funder should exercise caution when using policy tools that support the for\u2010profit sector\u2014for example, patient subsidies\u2014because such tools may increase patient costs in the long run; it might be preferable to raise the non\u2010profit sector's level of reimbursement.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12416","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['non-profit', 'for-profit', 'patient care']","The article discusses the operational performance of hospitals with a focus on non-profit versus for-profit objectives, touching on patient care and costs.

We propose an egalitarian total utility maximizing mechanism for coordination and risk pooling in a bidding club and describe characteristics of consumers for whom participation in the club makes sense. We show that, in the absence of risk pooling, a plausible bidding club strategy using just information exchange gives almost the same benefits to consumers as coordinated bidding. In contrast, coordinated bidding with risk pooling can lead to significantly increased benefits for consumers. The benefits of risk pooling are highest for consumers with a low tolerance to risk.

However, the possibility of markdown pricing creates an incentive for customers to strategize over the timing of their purchases. How should a retailing firm optimally account for customer behavior when making its pricing and stocking/capacity decisions? For example, is it optimal for a firm to create rationing risk by deliberately under stocking products? In this study, we develop a stylized modeling framework to answer these questions. In our model, customers strategize over the timing of their purchases. However, customers have boundedly rational expectations in the sense of anecdotal reasoning about the firm's fill rate, i.e., they have to rely on anecdotes, past experiences, or word\u2010of\u2010mouth to infer the firm's fill rate. In our modeling framework, we distinguish two settings: (i) capacity commitment, where the firm commits to its capacity level in the long run, or (ii) the firm dynamically changes it in each season. For both settings, within the simplest form of anecdotal reasoning, we prove that strategic capacity rationing is not optimal independent of customer risk preferences. Then, using a general form of anecdotal reasoning, we provide sufficient conditions for capacity rationing to be optimal for both settings, respectively. We show that the result of strategic capacity rationing being suboptimal is fairly robust to different valuation distributions and utility functions, heterogeneous sample size, and price optimization.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12420","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and capacity management in retail without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

We show that a store brand may benefit the manufacturer when the interaction between the manufacturer and retailer is modeled as a retailer\u2010led Stackelberg game. This phenomenon occurs because the store brand changes the nature of the strategic interaction between the manufacturer and retailer in our model. In particular, while the interaction is always vertical strategic substitutability without a store brand, it may become vertical strategic independence with one. With the store brand, the demand for the national brand becomes larger, and the wholesale price for the national brand may increase, both of which benefit the manufacturer. Finally, the store brand may lessen the double marginalization problem of the supply chain for the national brand in the retailer\u2010led Stackelberg game, but does so in an unconventional way: The reduction in the double marginalization effect may come from a lowered retail markup instead of a lowered wholesale price.

A major challenge of the approach lies in solving the resulting approximate linear programs (ALPs), which often have a huge number of constraints and/or variables. Starting from a recently developed compact affine ALP for network RM, we develop a novel dynamic disaggregation algorithm to solve the problem, which combines column and constraint generation and exploits the structure of the underlying problem. We show that the formulation can be further tightened by considering structural properties satisfied by an optimal solution. We prove that the sum of dynamic bid\u2010prices across resources is concave over time. We also give a counterexample to demonstrate that the dynamic bid\u2010prices of individual resources are not concave in general. Numerical experiments demonstrate that dynamic disaggregation is often orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms in the literature for problem instances with and without choice. In addition, adding the concavity constraints can further speed up the algorithm, often by an order of magnitude, for problem instances with choice.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12239","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of linear programming and algorithm development without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Of these savings, $24\u00a0million are direct savings for airlines due to reduced fuel usage, corresponding to a potential savings of 10%\u201315% in fuel consumption over current practice.

We extend recent literature that develops the idea that outsourcing can help firms avoid overinvestment by specifying more precisely the conditions under which this thesis is likely to apply. Our extension is realized through a two\u2010period game theoretic model in which the outsourcing and in\u2010house investments are driven by (1) the cost required to develop a product or process module, (2) competitive relevance, defined as the module's share in the production cost or the module's importance to the customer, and (3) modularity, defined as the extent to which generic investments in the module can approach firm\u2010specific investments in terms of the overall product/process performance. The analysis generates predictions about what types of insourcing, outsourcing, and non\u2010sourcing behaviors are likely to emerge in different parts of the parameter space. Outsourcing to a more concentrated industry upstream emerges at equilibrium when modularity is high, relevance low to medium, and development cost high enough that none or only a subset of focal firms wants to invest. While firms are forced to insource and overinvest due to a prisoner's dilemma when the development cost is sufficiently high relative to the module's relevance, we do not find outsourcing equilibria that solve this problem in a two\u2010period game with no commitment.

Evidence suggests that gray markets make the original manufacturer worse off globally by eroding profit margins in developed markets. Thus, it is interesting that many firms do not implement control systems to curb gray market activity. Our analysis suggests that one possible explanation lies at the intersection of two economic phenomena: firms investing to build emerging market demand, and investments conferring positive externalities (spillovers) on a rival's demand. We find that gray markets amplify the incentives to invest in emerging markets, because investments increase both emerging market consumption and the gray market's cost base. Moreover, when market\u2010creating investments confer positive spillovers, each firm builds its own market more efficiently. Thus, firms can be better off with gray markets when investments confer spillovers, provided the spillover effect is sufficiently large. These results provide a perspective on why firms might not implement control systems to prevent gray market distribution in sectors where investment spillovers are common (e.g., the technology sector) and, more broadly, why gray markets persist in the economy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12254","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['gray markets', 'emerging markets', 'spillovers']","The article primarily focuses on economic phenomena related to gray markets and investment strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

To account for these systematic biases, based on the quantal response equilibrium framework, we develop a behavioral model with different mental weights on the underage and overage costs to characterize a retailer's perception bias regarding a critical fractile. Based on the parameter estimates, we show that retailers perceive the critical fractile as being closer to 0.5 than it is, and the perceived critical fractile increases over time.

Furthermore, revenue management decisions are consistently higher compared to the newsvendor order quantities. In the face of increasing demand variability, revenue managers increase allocations; this behavior is consistent with normative patterns when the ratio of the selling prices of the two customer segments is less than 1/2, but is its exact opposite when this ratio is greater than 1/2. Newsvendors' behavior with respect to changing demand variability, on the other hand, is consistent with normative trends.

Prior literature has proposed the critical level rationing (CLR) policy under which the demand from the lower priority class is backordered once inventory falls below the critical level. While this reduces the penalty cost for the higher demand class, the fill rate achieved for the lower priority demand class gets compromised. In this study, we propose a new class of two\u2010bin (2B) policy for the problem. The proposed 2B policy assigns separate bins of inventory for the two demand classes. The demand for each class is fulfilled from its assigned bin. However, when the bin intended for the higher demand class is empty, the demand from the higher class can still be fulfilled with the inventory from the other bin. The advantage of the 2B policy is that better fill rates are achieved, especially for the lower demand class. Computational results show that the proposed policy is able to provide a much higher service level for the lower priority class demand without increasing the total cost too much and without affecting the service level for the higher priority class. When a service level constrained optimization problem is considered, the 2B policy dominates the CLR policy when the service level difference for the two classes is not too high or the service levels required for both the classes are relatively lower.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12299","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical inventory management policy without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We establish the optimality to change the price from low to high in each replenishment cycle as inventory is depleted. With costly price adjustment, scale economies of inventory replenishment are reflected in the cycle time instead of lot size\u2014An increased fixed ordering cost leads to an extended replenishment cycle but does not necessarily increase the order quantity. A reduced marginal cost of ordering calls for an increased order quantity, as well as speeding up product selling within a cycle. We derive useful properties of the profit function that allows for reducing computational complexity of the problem. For systems requiring short replenishment cycles, the optimal solution can be easily computed by applying these properties. For systems requiring long replenishment cycles, we further consider a relaxed problem that is computational tractable. Under this relaxation, the sum of fixed ordering cost and price adjustment cost is equal to (greater than, less than) the total inventory holding cost within a replenishment cycle when the inventory holding cost is linear (convex, concave) in the stock level. Moreover, under the optimal solution, the time\u2010average profit is the same across all price segments when the inventory holding cost is accounted properly. Through a numerical study, we demonstrate that inventory\u2010based dynamic pricing can lead to significant profit improvement compared with static pricing and limited price adjustment can yield a benefit that is close to unlimited price adjustment.

We find that adjusting prices is more effective in controlling gray market activity than reducing product availability, and that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to reduce her price gap while demand uncertainty forces her to lower prices. Furthermore, we explore the impact of market conditions (such as market base, price sensitivity, and demand uncertainty) and product characteristics (\u201cfashion\u201d vs. \u201ccommodity\u201d) on the manufacturer's policy towards parallel importation.

These auction formats are straightforward multi\u2010object extensions of the first\u2010price sealed\u2010bid auction. We derive the risk\u2010neutral symmetric Bayes Nash equilibrium strategies and find that, although the two auction mechanisms yield the same expected costs to the buyer, other aspects of the two models, including the equilibrium bidding strategies, differ significantly. The strategic considerations in these auction formats are more involved than in single\u2010lot first\u2010price sealed\u2010bid auctions, and it is questionable whether expected utility maximization can explain human bidding behavior in such multi\u2010object auctions. Therefore, we analyzed the predictive accuracy of our equilibrium strategies in the laboratory.

To control for regret, we organize experiments against computerized bidders, who play the equilibrium strategy. In computerized experiments where bid functions are only used in a single auction, we found significant underbidding on low\u2010cost draws. In experiments where the bid function is reused in 100 auctions, we could also control effectively for risk aversion, and there is no significant difference of the average bidding behavior and the risk\u2010neutral Bayes Nash equilibrium bid function.

For our samples, we find that a selection of distinctive terms, product features, and semantic factors are strong indicators of defects, whereas stylistic, social, and sentiment features are not.

We study which strategy (1) better encourages suppliers' quality improvement efforts and (2) leads to a higher expected profit for the buyer. To analyze the drivers behind the buyer's choice between QR and QP, we start with the basic model where buyer faces only one supplier who has the opportunity to make quality improvements. We then gradually add other business features such as information asymmetry and supplier competition, analyzing how each feature adds/changes the driving forces and how they interact in the buyer's decision between QR and QP. We consider both the case where the wholesale price is fixed (when the buyer has the power to dictate price or price is set by the market) and the case where the wholesale price is included as a variable (when price is part of the negotiation). We find that QP always leads to the first\u2010best quality efforts from the supplier(s) while QR limits their efforts. However, this does not guarantee higher expected profit for the buyer under QP.

Access to customers' subscription histories permits the monopolist to design pricing policies that can be based on customers' past purchase behavior, and on the time period in which they made their purchases. Uncertainty regarding the value of new features, and heterogeneity in consumers' valuation for existing features, creates inter\u2010temporal incentives that influence both profits and the rate of adoption of new technology. We find that the comparison of pricing regimes critically depends on whether the monopolist finds it optimal to encourage all consumers to adopt the new technology early. The pricing regimes differ only when the prior heterogeneity in consumer valuation for the existing features is relatively large, in which case the monopolist finds it optimal to serve only the part of the population of consumers that has a relatively high valuation. The monopolist can improve his profits by committing to ignore consumer past behavior, and to vary prices based only on the time period. If a stronger commitment to never utilize any price discrimination is feasible, the profits of the monopolist are even higher. However, the \u201cFirst Best\u201d outcome cannot be achieved, because it requires the monopolist to discriminate in favor of returning customers, by offering them lower prices than it offers to new customers. We also investigate the effect of positive correlation between the consumer valuations for the existing and the new features of the technology. We find that, as the correlation increases, the gap in profits among the various regimes narrows, while the ranking of the regimes remains the same. In particular, with perfect correlation, time inconsistency issues that arise due to lack of commitment disappear completely for all regimes, and the \u201cFirst Best\u201d outcome is attainable.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12317","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The state space is kept to a minimum due to three fundamental insights. The performance of the optimal solution approach is compared with two heuristics based on relaxations and a benchmark approach in which order crossovers are ignored. A numerical analysis reveals that average cost savings up to 25% are possible if the optimal policy is used instead of the benchmark approach. The contribution of this study is threefold: (1) it generalizes theory on MRP ordering, allowing for lead time differences and order crossovers; (2) it develops new fundamental insights and an optimal solution procedure, leading to substantial cost saving; and (3) it provides good\u2010performing heuristics for a general and realistic replenishment problem that can replace the current replenishment methods within MRP.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12318","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of material requirements planning without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Order release is a key component of the Workload Control concept that aims to maintain work\u2010in\u2010process within limits while ensuring due dates are met. Order release includes two decisions: (i) a sequencing decision that establishes the order in which jobs are considered for release; and, (ii) a selection decision that determines the criteria for choosing jobs for release. While selection has received much research attention, sequencing has been largely neglected. Using simulation, this study uncovers the potential for performance improvement in the sequencing decision and improves our understanding of how order release methods should be designed. Although most prior studies apply time\u2010oriented sequencing rules and load\u2010oriented selection rules, analysis reveals that load balancing considerations should also be incorporated in the sequencing decision. But an exclusive focus on load balancing is shown to increase mean tardiness and, paradoxically, require high workloads. A new sequencing rule is developed that only balances loads when multiple orders become urgent. It avoids high mean tardiness and allows the shop to operate at a low workload level. At the same time, the percentage tardy is reduced by up to 50% compared to a purely time\u2010oriented rule.

The problem of maximizing the total weighted revenue of a display is strongly NP\u2010hard. Therefore, we decompose it into two subproblems. The first consists of allocating products to different cabinets. In the second, within each cabinet, each product's units are arranged in a contiguous rectangle and assigned a location. These subproblems are solved using an innovative approach that uses a combination of integer programming and an algorithm for the maximum\u2010weight independent set problem.

The former is determined exogenously by the demand side, while the latter is determined jointly by the inventory level on the supply side and the consumer valuations in the time remaining within the selling horizon. Because of the importance of bid prices in theory and practice of RM, this study aims to enhance the understanding of the intertemporal behavior of bid prices in dynamic RM environments. We provide a probabilistic characterization of the optimal policies from the perspective of bid\u2010price processes. We show that an optimal bid\u2010price process has an upward trend over time before the inventory level falls to one and then has a downward trend. This intertemporal up\u2010then\u2010down pattern of bid\u2010price processes is related to two fundamental static properties of the optimal bid prices: (i) At any given time, a lower inventory level yields a higher optimal bid price, which is referred to as the resource scarcity effect; (ii) Given any inventory level, the optimal bid price decreases with time; that is referred to as the resource perishability effect. The demonstrated upward trend implies that the optimal bid\u2010price process is mainly driven by the resource scarcity effect, while the downward trend implies that the bid\u2010price process is mainly driven by the resource perishability effect. We also demonstrate how optimal bid price and consumer valuation, as two competing forces, interact over time to drive the optimal\u2010price process. The results are also extended to the network RM problems.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12324","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a manufacturer who leases her product directly to consumers as a point of reference, we find that an isolated change in either the channel structure (selling through an intermediary), or the operational mode (leasing to selling) can decrease the manufacturer's willingness to provide durability.

Consequently, some shippers are reluctant to book directly from the carrier in advance unless the carrier is willing to \u201cpartially match\u201d the realized spot price when it is lower than the regular price.

The shipper pays the regular freight price in advance; however, the shipper will get a refund if the realized spot price is below the regular price, where the refund is a \u201cfraction\u201d of the difference between the regular price and the realized spot price. By modeling the dynamics between the carrier and the shippers as a sequential game, we show that the carrier can use the fractional price matching contract to generate a higher demand from the shippers compared to no price matching contract by increasing the \u201cfraction\u201d in equilibrium. However, as the carrier increases the \u201cfraction,\u201d the carrier should increase the regular price to compensate for bearing additional risk. By selecting the fractional price matching contract optimally, we show that the carrier can afford to offer this price matching mechanism without incurring revenue loss: the optimal fractional price matching contract is \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12337","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies in the ocean freight service industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using survey data from 193 service organizations and structural equation modeling techniques, we show that the two infusion dimensions are significantly associated with improved process performance.

From a practical perspective, this might be indicative of another classic marketing\u2010operations trade\u2010off. Offering more options for consumers would be preferred by marketing managers since this would reach more consumers and hence, enhance product sales. On the other hand, the ability to obtaining greater forecast accuracy would decline when the number of options increase.

In order to minimize cooling cost, compact storage systems are used. A major disadvantage of these systems is that additional retrieval time is needed, caused by necessary reshuffles due to the improper storage sequence of unit loads. In practice therefore, a dedicated storage policy is used in which every storage lane in the system accommodates only one product. However, this policy does not use the planned arrival time information of the outbound trucks. To exploit this information, this study proposes a mathematical model for a shared storage policy that minimizes total retrieval time. The policy allows different products to share the same lane. In order to solve real\u2010sized problems, an effective and efficient heuristic is proposed, based on a greedy construction and an improvement part, which provides near optimal solutions. The gaps between the results of the heuristic and the lower bound are mostly less than 1%. The resulting shared storage policy is generally robust against disturbances in arrival or departure times. We compare our shared storage heuristic with dedicated storage to determine which policy performs best under which circumstances.

As it turns out, this enhances the overall supply chain performance. The supplier anticipates the effect of the strategic inventory and differentiates prices to capture a part of the increased supply chain profits. Our results show that the positive effects of strategic inventories are even more pronounced than theoretically predicted, because strategic inventories empower buyers by shifting the perception of the fair split.

While providing incentives for socially desirable behavior to achieve legislative goals has intuitive appeal, the broader economic consequences are not always fully understood. In this study, we examine such wider consequences for supply chains when subsidies for CSR are offered. One effect we identify is that since incentives are typically tied to market value, firms have not only an added incentive to achieve societal objectives (say by donating inventory) but also an incentive to raise output (retail) market prices. A second consequence is that since firms forgo potential revenues by engaging in socially desired behavior, they become increasingly sensitive to supplier pricing; in an uncoordinated supply chain this leads to input (wholesale) price concessions.

This information is usually disseminated free of charge. While farmers can use the market information to improve their production plans without incurring any (significant) cost, adopting agricultural advice to improve operations requires upfront investment, for example, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides, and higher quality seeds. In this study, we examine whether farmers should use market information to improve their production plans (or adopt agricultural advice to improve their operations) when they engage in Cournot competition under both uncertain market demand and uncertain process yield. Our analysis indicates that both farmers will use the market information to improve their profits in equilibrium. Hence, relative to the base case in which market information is not available, the provision of market information can improve the farmers' total welfare (i.e., total profit for both farmers). Moreover, when the underlying process yield is highly uncertain or when the products are highly heterogeneous, the provision of market information is welfare\u2010maximizing in the sense that the maximum total welfare of farmers is attained when both farmers utilize market information in equilibrium. Furthermore, in equilibrium, whether a farmer adopts the agricultural advice depends on the size of the requisite upfront investment. More importantly, we show that agricultural advice is not always welfare improving unless the upfront investment is sufficiently low.

Unfortunately, OMWE's also have challenges. First, sellers may have access to other disposal options and, as a result, may not fully commit to the exchange. Second, buyers can face high uncertainty about the product exchanged and the transaction being undertaken. Overcoming these challenges is the \u201clast hurdle\u201d to making OMWEs successful. This study investigates the factors that reduce the buyers' uncertainty and increase the sellers' commitment to the OMWE. We analyze novel transaction\u2010level data from an online exchange (MNExchange.org) combined with other archival public records on county\u2010level repurposing and disposal statistics. First, we find that regional repurposing policies and alternatives have a complementary effect on sellers' commitment toward OMWEs, resulting in increased OMWE exchanges. However, regional disposal policies and alternatives have a substitution effect on sellers' commitment, resulting in reduced exchange success. Further, greater product and transaction information reduce the buyer's uncertainty and increase exchange success. Finally, the analysis shows that users' (buyers and sellers) heavily rely on their prior experience with OMWEs. Specifically, higher familiarity between the buyer\u2013seller pair and familiarity with the OMWE system leads to higher likelihood of exchange success. This study lays the foundation for understanding OMWEs and has important implications for developing policies and operations to increase online transactions of by\u2010products, materials and wastes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12345","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['repurposing', 'waste', 'sustainability', 'policies', 'commitment']","The article discusses the repurposing of materials and waste, which aligns with sustainability themes, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility in operations management.

To alleviate poverty, various non\u2010governmental organizations (NGOs) and for\u2010profit companies have developed different ways to distribute information about market price, crop advisory and farming technique to farmers. We investigate a fundamental question: will information create economic value for farmers? We construct a stylized model in which farmers face an uncertain market price (demand) and must make production decisions before the market price is realized. Each farmer has an imprecise private signal and an imprecise public signal to estimate the actual market price. By examining the equilibrium outcomes associated with a Cournot competition game, we show that private signals do create value by improving farmers' welfare. However, this value deteriorates as the public signal becomes available (or more precise). In contrast, in the presence of private signals, the public signal does not always create value for the farmers. Nevertheless, both private and public signals will reduce price variation. We also consider two separate extensions that involve non\u2010identical private signal precisions and farmers' risk\u2010aversion, and we find that the same\u00a0results continue to hold. More importantly, we find that the public signal can reduce welfare inequality when farmers have non\u2010identical private signal precisions. Also, risk\u2010aversion can dampen the value created by private or public information.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12371","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['poverty', 'welfare', 'inequality', 'farmers', 'information']","The article addresses issues of poverty and welfare inequality among farmers in developing economies, indicating a moderate focus on social impact.

Aggregating farmers through formal or informal cooperatives (coops) can enable them to: (i) reduce production cost; (ii) increase/stabilize process yield; (iii) increase brand awareness; (iv) eliminate unnecessary intermediaries; and (v) eliminate price uncertainty. To examine whether these effects will benefit the members of such aggregation when they compete with other individual farmers, we present separate models to capture the essence of these five effects. For each effect, we find that it is beneficial for a farmer to be part of the aggregation only when the size of the aggregation is below a certain threshold. Also, while certain effects are beneficial to the market as a whole, other effects are hurtful due to higher market price and/or lower production quantity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12372","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['smallholder farmers', 'poverty', 'cooperatives', 'market price', 'production quantity']","The article discusses the challenges faced by smallholder farmers trapped in poverty and the potential benefits of cooperatives, indicating a moderate focus on social equity and economic justice.

We explore the problem from a central policymaker's perspective who wants to maximize social welfare. We consider two stakeholders, retailers, and consumers, who optimize their own objectives (i.e., profits and net utility) and three competitive settings (i.e., monopoly, monopolistic competition with symmetric market share, and monopolistic competition with asymmetric market share). For the monopoly case, we find that when the retailer's profit is high, imposing some carbon emission charges on the retailer and the consumers does not substantially change the supply chain structure or the social welfare. However, when the retailer's profit is low, imposing carbon costs optimally can lead to a significant increase in social welfare. Moreover, the impact of imposing carbon emission charges becomes more significant when the degree of competition increases. Additionally, the quantum of benefit may depend only on factors common across industries, such as fuel and carbon costs.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12373","research article","POM","Operations Management","6","['carbon costs', 'social welfare', 'stakeholders', 'competition']","The article discusses the implications of carbon costs on supply chain structure and social welfare, indicating a focus on societal impact and ethical considerations in business practices.

This model is tested empirically through analysis of a dataset of opinion\u2010based survey responses from practitioners at 334 companies across 17 industries. The analysis finds specific penalties and incentives that are positively associated with reduced supplier violations and reduced buyer operating costs.

In the spirit of the Triple Bottom Line (3BL), we ascertain that exporting (importing) water through a water market defined by an exogenous export/import price is detrimental (beneficial) to both society and the environment within the municipality. In contrast, fixed quantity trading between two municipalities defined by an endogenously negotiated export/import price can have positive as well as negative impacts from a global 3BL perspective. In particular, typical trading scenarios that occur between municipalities can be detrimental to the environment. We also study the implications of privatization, and find that a privatized municipality would be more (less) likely to export (import) water as compared to its non\u2010privatized counterpart, resulting in negative implications for society within the municipality. However, if exports are banned, privatization can benefit the environment by mitigating the damage caused by the extraction differential, a phenomenon analogous to the green paradox.

Overall, our study shows theoretically and empirically that both attention and uncertainty are key determinants of asset prices.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/1/33/1681808","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically investor behavior and asset pricing, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The foreign ownership return is of similar economic significance as traditional country and industry factors in explaining international stock returns. It is not related to omitted fundamentals or wealth effects but shifts substantially around ADR and index listings when the investor habitat changes. A decomposition shows that the foreign ownership return is driven by active reallocations of global institutions as opposed to fund flows from end investors.

CDS introduction involves a trade-off: it crowds out existing demand for the bond, but improves the bond allocation by allowing long-term investors to become levered basis traders and absorb more of the bond supply. We characterize conditions under which CDS introduction raises bond prices. The model predicts a negative CDS-bond basis, as well as turnover and price impact patterns that are consistent with empirical evidence.

In addition, it outperforms well-recognized macroeconomic variables and can also predict cross-sectional stock returns sorted by industry, size, value, and momentum.

To characterize diversification potential, we estimate spatial correlation and integration among 401 U.S. metropolitan housing markets. The 2000s boom brought a marked uptrend in housing market integration associated with eased residential lending standards and rapid growth in private mortgage securitization. As boom turned to bust, other macroeconomic factors, including employment and income fundamentals, importantly contributed to the trending up in housing return integration.

We find that the new conditional covariance risk measure plays an important role in explaining time variation in the equity risk premium.

In contrast, our results suggest that SDFs as functions of individual stock returns are generally downward sloping. A simple jump-diffusion model can reconcile these empirical findings. The same model also implies a steeper implied-volatility curve for the index than for the typical stock, a well-known empirical fact from the options literature. Both the SDF and volatility-curve results can be explained by a common source of jump risk among stocks, together with diversification of Brownian risk in the index. We also devise novel empirical tests of SDF monotonicity based on average returns of option trading strategies, thus avoiding the estimation of the return density functions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/5/1462/1867968","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the stochastic discount factor and option returns, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2015","28","5","Alexandros Kostakis\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Alexandros Kostakis\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Manchester\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Tassos Magdalinos\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Tassos Magdalinos\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Southampton\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Michalis P.

We find that firms' TFP increases after their states implement these deregulations. Using a regression discontinuity approach based on the Small Business Administration's funding eligibility criteria, we show that TFP increases following the deregulations are significantly greater for financially constrained firms.

Empirically, we confirm the predictions that the fraction of fast traders (1) reduces the equilibrium liquidity supply and (2) reduces the magnitude of the cancellations following a trade.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/7/2094/1592937","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading strategies and market dynamics without addressing any social issues, ethics, or diversity themes.

Evidence from Repeated Natural Experiments","We hypothesize that individual investors treat trading as a fun and exciting gambling activity, implying substitution between this activity and alternative gambling opportunities. To examine this hypothesis, we study the lottery jackpots and the trading of individual investors in Taiwan. When the jackpots exceed 500 million Taiwan dollars, the trading volume decreases between 5.2% and 9.1% among stocks preferred by individual investors and between 6.8% and 8.6% among lottery-like stocks. The decline in individual buy volume is statistically indistinct from the decline in sell volume.

Overall, the evidence suggests that the negative externalities financially constrained firms impose on their industry peers can significantly amplify the effects of industry downturns. The evidence also provides support for the view that these amplification effects are driven by the adverse effect that financially constrained firms have on the balance sheets of their industry peers.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/9/2463/1580530","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis regarding industry downturns and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

However, recent laboratory findings suggest that difficult tasks tend to produce underconfidence. How do entrepreneurs maintain confidence in difficult tasks? Our two laboratory experiments and one archival study reconcile the literature by distinguishing types of overconfidence and identifying what type is most prominent in each type of task. Furthermore, we critically examine the notion that \u2018overconfidence\u2019 explains excess market entry: we find that entry into different markets is not driven by confidence in one's own absolute skill, but by confidence in one's skill relative to that of others. Finally, we consider whether overconfidence in relative skill is driven by neglecting competitors or by systematic errors made when considering them.

A common objective of this research is to identify top performers in an industry and their sources of competitive advantage. Despite this focus on best firms and practices, most researchers utilize statistical methods that identify average effects in a sample, and they assess a single performance dimension while ignoring other relevant dimensions. Emphasis on purely financial measures can overlook the fact that a firm's efficiency in transforming resources has been shown as a major source of competitive advantage. In this article we demonstrate how frontier methodologies, such as Data Envelopment Analysis and the Stochastic Frontier approach, can address these challenges.

Firms instead might motivate knowledge workers by offering them opportunities to increase personal benefits (e.g., learning, satisfaction) through autonomy in the decision-making process. Our model shows that firms can offer less autonomy in projects closer to their core business: Because firm specialization raises the value of the project's outcomes, it also increases the benefits for knowledge workers, who derive motivation even though they make fewer decisions to support their realization of personal goals. Projects farther from the core offer weaker firm contributions, so firms can motivate knowledge workers by allowing them to benefit from greater autonomy. We discuss several implications of our analysis.

Capability development trajectories are the paths over which firms' capabilities change with experience and other activities. While prior research focused on factors affecting capability development rate (the fraction of the gap between a firm's current and potential capability eliminated with each unit of activity), we argue that capability development trajectories also differ in potential (the maximum capability level a firm could achieve through repeating a given set of activities over time). We develop and estimate a formal model of capability development, showing that larger underwriting projects lead to a lower rate of improvement toward higher potential capabilities, and derive implications for research on industry dynamics and the nature of competitive advantage.

I propose a model where such a link is mediated by the accumulation and churning of local resources and capabilities. I also introduce the concept of support-adjusted sustainable competitive advantage (SASCA), which occurs if a firm's observed performance is superior to the expected performance of competitors had they received the same array of policies. I argue that achieving SASCA through IP is a difficult endeavor and requires the interplay of three conditions: insertion in global production networks, geographical specificity, and governmental capability. Thus, the model expands the potential determinants of competitive advantage into the context of governmental intervention.

Evidence from fortune 500 firms","Agency theory predicts that incentives will align agents' interests with those of principals. However, the resource-based view suggests that to be effective, the incentive to deliver must be paired with the ability to deliver. Using Fortune 500 boards as an empirical context, this study shows that the presence of directors who lack top-level experience but own large shareholdings is negatively associated with firm value, an effect that increases in the number of such directors. Firm value rises after such directors depart from boards, with the greatest increases occurring when many of these directors leave. While agency theory highlights the importance of the right incentives being in place, this research suggests that this can be ineffective if the right resources are not also in place.

In this field study of a high-stakes strategic decision, we explore an alternative view that heuristics may serve as powerful cognitive tools that enable, rather than limit, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments. We examine the cognitive efforts of senior decision makers of an inexperienced multinational, as they assessed a potential acquisition in a politically hazardous African country.

Despite the ever-increasing volume of nomological research on EO, there remain ongoing conversations regarding its ontology. Drawing from measurement theory, we outline an EO reconceptualization addressing the likely prevalence of Type II nomological error in the EO literature stemming from measurement model misspecification. Focusing on the question of whether EO is an attitudinal construct, a behavioral construct, or both, we propose a formative construction of EO viewing the exhibition of entrepreneurial behaviors and of managerial attitude towards risk as jointly necessary dimensions that collectively form the higher-order EO construct. We present an empirical illustration of our reconceptualization followed by a discussion of future research opportunities.

Evidence from trade liberalization","This study examines whether product market competition affects corporate social responsibility (CSR). To obtain exogenous variation in product market competition, I exploit a quasi-natural experiment provided by large import tariff reductions that occurred between 1992 and 2005 in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, I find that domestic companies respond to tariff reductions by increasing their engagement in CSR. This finding supports the view of \u201cCSR as a competitive strategy\u201d that allows companies to differentiate themselves from their foreign rivals.

When state-sanctioned intellectual property (IP) rights are ineffective or costly to enforce, modularity can be used to hide information and thus protect IP. We investigate the impact of modularity on IP protection by formally modeling the threat of expropriation by agents. The principal has three options to address this threat: trust, licensing, and paying agents to stay loyal. We show how the principal can influence the value of these options by modularizing the system and by hiring clans of agents, thus exploiting relationships among them. Extensions address screening and signaling in hiring, the effects of an imperfect legal system, and social norms of fairness.

We address this oversight by integrating top management team heterogeneity and any resulting faultline strength with the resource-action-performance model to investigate how TMT composition differentially affects the model's two linkages. Specifically, we argue that TMT heterogeneity positively affects the resource-action linkage, yet negatively affects the action-performance linkage. Moreover, when heterogeneity begets strong faultlines, all such positive effect is lost. Supportive evidence from the in-vitro medical diagnostic substance manufacturing industry allows us to discuss how our findings contribute to upper echelons theory, as well as the emerging stream on resource utilization.

This paper analyzes how resource relatedness influences a firm's decision between internal development and collaborative arrangement as modes of entry. We distinguish between a firm's capacity to transfer its established resources to the new segment (resource transferability) and the integration and synergistic combination of current firm resources with target segment resources in day-to-day operations (resource complementarity). Resource transferability makes entry by internal development more likely, but this effect depends on segment characteristics. Synergies from complementary resources can be exploited more easily within firm boundaries than across an alliance interface. However, certain partner characteristics can substitute in part for belonging to the same firm.

A puzzle, however, is that an economic shock increases environmental uncertainty and therefore the risk associated with growth reconfiguration. This study finds that growth reduced performance and increased the risk of firm failure during the Asian economic shock of 1997. Growing firms differed in the extent to which they were able to mitigate the constraints imposed by the shock. However, the presence of developed external institutions played a more systematic role in their adaptation than did organizational resources represented by financial slack or product diversification. The deliberate attempt to reconfigure augmented the adverse effect of the economic shock on firm performance and survival.

The impact of functional background and top executive mobility on firm survival","Do some top executives matter more than others? Integrating insights from upper echelons and executive mobility research, we suggest that the functional roles performed by top executives shape their value to the firm. We examine the effects of interfirm executive mobility on firm survival for New York City advertising firms from 1924 to 1996. We find that, while losing any top executive is damaging, the loss of a top executive whose functional role focuses on internal firm processes is more detrimental to firm survival than losing a top executive whose functional role focuses on managing external exchange relationships. Additionally, in situations when multiple executives leave simultaneously, firms are more negatively affected when the group departing is functionally heterogeneous.

Financial development, in contrast, may have undermined the value of PE firm local origins. These results help reconcile contrasting findings on how host country institutions influence performance and lead us to contend that unbundling institutions is necessary for continued development of the institutions-based view.

Results reveal the intriguing finding that, on average, firms with top executives who lean toward the Republican Party actually engage in less tax avoidance than firms whose executives lean toward the Democratic Party. We also examine changes in tax avoidance around CEO turnovers and find corroborating evidence. Additionally, we find that political orientation is helpful in explaining top management team composition and CEO succession. Our paper extends theory and research by (1) illustrating how tax avoidance can serve as another measure of corporate risk taking and (2) using political orientation as a proxy for managerial conservatism, which is an ex ante measure of a manager's propensity toward risk.

Our results support this premise, particularly when preceding acquisitions happened more recently and were similar in size to the focal deals, when focal deals were in a foreign market, and when acquirers lacked acquisition experience in the target market or had a higher acquisition rate.

Specifically, we propose that CEOs with negative relative pay standing status (underpaid relative to comparison CEOs) will engage in acquisition activity, as a self-interested means of attempting to realign their pay with that of their peers. We further propose that, when CEOs with negative relative pay standing acquire, they will tend to finance those acquisitions more heavily with stock than cash, to mitigate the risk associated with those deals. Finally, we argue that acquisition activity will partially mediate the influence of CEO negative relative pay standing on subsequent CEO compensation increases; however, that pay growth will come primarily in the form of long-term incentive pay.

In investigating this relationship, we join the technological management literature and the institution-based view of strategy and maintain that the value of complementary resources is contingent on the institutional environment in which the firm operates. In particular, we submit that formal institutions, both economic and political, moderate the relationship between the stock of complementary assets and firm performance. We test our hypotheses in the context of the world mobile telecommunications industry (39 countries and 134 mobile service providers). Our findings reveal how these resources are more valuable for incumbents in markets where market-supporting institutions are weaker and political stability is higher.

Building on prior literature on executive job demands, we posit that new CEOs hired in turnaround situations will receive higher pay, particularly higher performance-based pay, and that the pay premium will incentivize them to undertake retrenchment and restructuring turnaround initiatives. An interaction between pay premium and CEO credentials is shown to have a stronger effect on the extent to which firms engage in such turnaround initiatives. Our empirical results, based on 98 new CEOs hired in 223 turnaround situations, largely support our arguments.

Co-CEOs, power gaps, and firm performance","At the pinnacles of organizations, comparative tests of unity of command and shared command are nearly impossible because only one individual sits atop most organizations. In organizations led by co-CEOs, however, such a test is possible because co-CEOs can truly share power. But do they? Our research pits the unity-of-command principle against the shared-command principle and finds overall support for the former, even within the co-CEO context. Our sample of 71 co-CEO pairs at publicly traded U.S. firms shows that increasing power gaps between co-CEOs are positively associated with firm performance. This positive association wanes and turns negative, however, as power gaps become very large.

We assemble separate dimensions of inducements from research on corporate diversification and real options and consider inducements in their entirety. A simulation model casts redeployability as a real option to switch the use of resources across markets and explicates important interdependences among the dimensions of inducements. The model also demonstrates that inducements modify the effect of relatedness on corporate value.

Combining diverse data sources, the authors examine the simultaneous effects of brand equity and human capital on firm value.

The effect of asymmetric dependence on internet firm failure","Although critical resource providers offer ample access benefits to deficient firms, dependence on these resource providers is burdensome because dependency places deficient firms into a vulnerable position, especially when the dependency is asymmetric. Thus, we ask: Is it better to balance dependence among critical resource providers or asymmetrically depend on one if there is more than one resource provider? We use a unique context of the internet industry where satellite internet firms depend on portals that provide Web traffic and find that asymmetric dependence on portals increases the likelihood of failure, but market leaders suffer less from asymmetric dependence, while satellite internet firms with higher dependence on portals suffer more from asymmetric dependence.

Relative standing refers to how the venture ranks among other ventures in the partner's portfolio with respect to expected returns. The relative standing of a venture in its partner's portfolio influences the venture's access to the partner's resources and the venture's performance. We also argue that a venture's relative standing becomes more important to performance when the partner has a larger portfolio or higher status. In addition to a field study, we test the effect of a venture's relative standing in a venture capital portfolio on its exit likelihood, controlling for endogeneity.

We argue that comparisons of performance to multiple aspiration levels over time affects the interpretative clarity of feedback and, consequently, shapes a firm's responsiveness. We further conceptualize the relationship between performance relative to social and historical aspirations as ambiguous, inconsistent, and consistent performance feedback. Empirically, we examine the effects\u2014on firms' responsiveness\u2014of weak, negative, and positive correlations between performance relative to social and historical aspirations, where responsiveness is measured in terms of new product introductions. We find that both inconsistent and consistent feedback increase a firm's responsiveness, whereas ambiguous feedback dampens responsiveness. Our focus on this type of feedback ambiguity is novel, and it establishes the functional form of the relationship between feedback clarity/ambiguity and responsiveness. This paper augments the behavioral theory of the firm and research on performance feedback; it also extends previous work on ambiguity in strategic decision making.

In contrast, scholars of organizational psychology suggest that hierarchies lead to evaluation apprehension and foster a perceived lack of control among mid-level managers, leading to their reduced willingness to, and interest in, passing information up within the organization.

They make such categorizations as inferences drawn from analogies from past experience. The accuracy of issue interpretations turns on: (1) which analogy is used, (2) what are the environment's properties, and (3) what is the timeframe? A computational model allows us to evaluate over time the accuracy of interpretations based on different forms of analogical reasoning in environments that differ in variation (unpredictability and dynamism) and complexity (dimensionality and ruggedness). This study elaborates a contingency approach to assessing analogical reasoning by organizations in which the form of analogical reasoning, environmental properties, and time all matter. Our findings indicate when particular forms of reasoning produce relatively more accurate inferences about opportunities and threats.

We formalize the notion that strategic interaction renders collocation less appealing by fostering competition, which erodes firms' profits. Strategic interaction also impacts location choices across time. Specifically, because firms learn by doing in markets, location choices are shaped by two novel effects: entrenchment benefits from entering early in a market and improving capabilities relative to rivals, and opportunity costs from postponing entry to other markets where rivals enter and learn. When learning is local, firms collocate more: rivals are preempted from improving relative capabilities in higher-value markets. However, when learning is global, firms collocate less: they can transfer capabilities from lower-value to higher-value markets, blocking rivals from achieving entrenchment benefits.

Our study offers a new perspective of directorate interlocks as mechanisms that enable firms to improve performance when confronted with greater uncertainty, suggesting that uncertainty positively moderates the interlock-performance relationship. This contrasts with the view based on resource dependence theory suggesting networks reduce uncertainty and enhance firm performance, implying that uncertainty mediates the interlock effect upon performance. Using a sample of 3,745 firms across manufacturing industries in the  United States during the period 2001\u20132009, we find support for the moderation argument and less convincing support for mediation, suggesting that firms may not form interlocks necessarily to reduce uncertainty. Instead, firms may create interlocks to enable adaptation and enhance performance when confronted by uncertainty.

The bulk of these findings, however, derive from market-based governance settings, which raises an issue of contextual robustness. This study examines this issue by investigating the link between executive succession and strategic change in Japan, a context noted for relatively weak market-based corporate governance and lack of board independence. We find a greater likelihood of strategic change after non-routine executive succession, with the extent of change unaffected by firm performance. Routine succession in the case of a powerful prior president leads to less post-succession strategic change.

We highlight three categories of challenges to managing resource vulnerability\u2014protecting them from erosion, coping with their ambiguity, and preserving their required alignment\u2014and identify sources of vulnerability within each.

We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of expert decision makers to make two main contributions. First, we identify and contrast the specific brain regions and cognitive processes associated with exploitation and exploration decisions. Exploitation activates regions associated with reward seeking, which track and evaluate the value of current choices, while exploration relies on regions associated with attentional control, tracking the value of alternative choices. Second, we propose and test the idea that stronger activation of the brain circuits related to attentional control allows individuals to achieve better decision-making performance as a result.

We draw on the complementary assets framework to predict entrants' technology choices in an emerging industry. Evidence from the global solar photovoltaic industry supports our arguments that entrants are more likely to choose technologies with higher technical performance and for which key complementary assets are available in the ecosystem. However, diversifying entrants are more likely to trade off superior performance for complementary asset availability whereas start-up entrants are more likely to trade off complementary asset availability for superior performance. This difference is largely due to diversifying entrants with pre-entry capabilities related to the industry.

Our results show that high levels of firm performance will be found around either meaningfully low or meaningfully high levels of pay disparity. Additional findings indicate that this curvilinear relationship is weakened in the presence of both an heir apparent and high CEO power, and strengthened when top management team members are more eligible as CEOs. These findings suggest that factors that increase or inhibit social comparison or tournament perceptions among TMT members play a role in the strength of the curvilinear relationship between pay disparity and firm performance.

Using a sample of Korean manufacturing MNEs during the 1993\u20132003 period, we find that geographic diversification into resource-poorer host countries has a positive relationship with firm profitability, whereas geographic diversification into resource-richer host countries has a U-shaped relationship with firm profitability.

There has been little attention, however, dedicated to understanding the mechanisms involved in making sense of and addressing such occurrences. Two experimental studies investigated how people interpret contract violations and how these interpretations affect trust and the management of relationships. By drawing on the distinction between violations of the letter versus spirit of the law, we show that letter violations are more difficult to overcome than spirit violations, due to higher perceived intentionality. These effects generalized across different populations, levels of contracting experience, types of contracting contexts, levels of ambiguity within the contract, and degrees of contract complexity. The results yield important implications for understanding contract violations, trust, and organizational responses as a relationship management capability.

Although institutional factors like non-compete regimes shape intra-industry mobility patterns, far less is known about firm-specific reputations built through patent enforcement. This study formally models and empirically tests how a firm's prior litigiousness over patents (i.e., its reputation for IP toughness) influences employee mobility. Based on inventor data from the U.S. semiconductor industry, we find that litigiousness not only diminishes the proclivity of inventive workers to \u201cjob hop\u201d to others in the industry, it also shifts the distribution of talent released to the market.

We conceptually argue and empirically show that relatively, M&A enhance bargaining power in the short term while organic growth enhances operating efficiency over the long term.

Such CEOs led firms with higher and more sustained market valuations. The advantage was strongest for undergraduate programs as these related to the kinds of talent demanded of a CEO. The advantage also was greatest in smaller firms where CEO discretion might be highest and for younger CEOs who may benefit most from college and are less able to appropriate rents. Finally, the advantage accrued to graduates of more recent years, when selective schools had become less socially elitist and increasingly meritocratic, thus favoring human versus social capital.

Departing from this traditional approach, we draw from behavioral decision theory to explain how relative pay levels influence firm risk taking. We investigate how CEO restricted stock value relative to reference point influences R&D intensity in high-technology firms. We propose that negative deviation increases are related to R&D increases and positive deviation increases lead to R&D decreases, while negative deviation has greater effect than positive deviation. We establish theoretical boundary conditions by considering CEO duality and board vigilance as moderators. Drawing from agency theory, we predict the main effects will be enhanced under duality and weakened under high board vigilance. Our hypotheses are largely supported.

We disaggregate the licensing process into three stages and find that, although lack of market thickness and deal failure are correlated in the first stage, they are not in the latter stages, underscoring the bilateral monopoly conditions under which negotiations over intellectual property often occur. In contrast, market safety is only salient in the final stage. Several commonly referenced bargaining frictions (congestion) are salient, particularly in the second stage.

Moreover, we theorize that, over time, the emergence of a stakeholder focus shifts the analysts' perceptions of CSR. Using a large sample of publicly traded U.S. firms over 15 years, we confirm that, in the early 1990s, analysts issue more pessimistic recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings.

Analyses of a sample of 451 new firms show that the riskier the opportunity, the greater the performance of the start-up, above and beyond founder characteristics. Moreover, the value of founder knowledge is relative to the type of opportunity exploited: high-risk opportunities favor founders with managerial experience, whereas low-risk opportunities favor founders with industry experience.

In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm.

Low quality patents with claims that overlap those of other patents contribute to these portfolios and patent strategies. By failing to disclose known relevant prior art during the patenting process, inventors and their firms may be granted low quality patents with intellectual property claims which would not otherwise have been granted. We find that the failure of inventors to disclose known relevant prior art increases as they gain experience with the patenting process. Such failure is also greater among inventors employed by relatively small, poorly performing firms that rely on outsourced legal counsel during the application process.

Because firms avoid publicizing their tainted-sector membership, when threatened, they can respond by divesting assets from that industry. Our analyses of the arms industry demonstrate that media attacks on the focal firm and its peers both increase the likelihood of divestment for the focal firm. Specifically, attacks on the focal firm are the most consequential, followed by attacks on peers in the same industry subcategory, and by attacks on peers in different subcategories. These findings shed new light on divestment as a response to media attacks in stigmatized industries and lead us to rethink impression management theory.

The model allows the firm to adjust its position in response to partial learning about a changing environment characterized by two path-dependent processes\u2014a random walk and a stochastic trend. Computational simulations at low levels of learning in both environmental contexts are consistent with empirical data. However, the results are also consistent when firm behavior appears to be mindless in the form of a random walk. Hence, both imperfect learning and a mindless random walk can lead to the inverse longitudinal risk-return relationships observed empirically. We discuss this apparent paradox and the possible resolution between mindless and conscious behavior as plausible causes of the longitudinal Bowman Paradox.

To predict how the special context of the CEO position might lead to identification, we consider a set of motives that members have for identifying with their organizations and consider how unique features of the CEO position might be relevant to those motives. Our theory and supportive findings help explain how the context of the CEO position, including variables often conceptualized as control mechanisms in agency theory research, can have important effects on subsequent CEO organizational identification.

We first develop the theoretical argument that CEO hubris is negatively related to a firm's socially responsible activities but positively related to its socially irresponsible activities. We then explore the boundary conditions of hubris effects and how these relationships are moderated by resource dependence mechanisms. With a longitudinal dataset of S&P 1500 index firms for the period 2001\u20132010, we find that the relationship between CEO hubris and CSR is weakened when the firm depends more on stakeholders for resources, such as when its internal resource endowments are diminished as indicated by firm size and slack, and when the external market becomes more uncertain and competitive. The implications of our findings for upper echelons theory and the CSR research are discussed.

In this paper, we argue that this does not imply they are always substitutes. Specifically, we consider the case of capital markets, a key economic institution: while the absence of well-developed capital markets may indeed have stimulated the emergence of business groups, we propose that BG affiliation and the scrutiny that maturing capital markets impose on firms that participate actively in them nevertheless can play a complementary role in influencing a firm's performance. We find support for our predictions in a novel longitudinal data set of Indian firms that contain both listed and unlisted BG affiliated as well as unaffiliated firms.

At low levels of within-industry diversification, coordination costs are negligible but \u201cadjustment costs\u201d are higher than the synergy benefits of a limited product scope, hence leading to negative performance outcomes. At moderate levels of within-industry diversification synergies between related product categories substantially increase and outweigh the rise in adjustment and coordination costs, resulting in positive performance outcomes. Yet, extensive within-industry diversification gives rise to considerable coordination costs, which, coupled with adjustment costs, outweigh synergy effects and hamper performance.

Our results show, contrary to past findings, that the use of multiple scenarios does not cause an aggregate increase or decrease in experts' confidence in their judgment. Rather, expert judgment changes in accordance with how an investment fares in a given scenario: it becomes more favorable if the investment is found to be useful for a particular scenario used by the expert, and vice versa. This scenario-induced change is moderated by the expert's confidence in his/her judgment before using the scenario.

The individual and collective effects of these mechanisms have been previously examined but not in specific contexts. This study examines the effects of contractual and relational governance on provider opportunism, incorporating the moderating influence of a \u201cshift parameter\u201d\u2014national culture. Our results reveal that contractual governance is more effective in individualistic and low uncertainty avoidance cultures. Relational governance is more effective in collectivist and high uncertainty avoidance societies. The individualism\u2013collectivism dimension also moderates the joint effect of these mechanisms. While the mechanisms are generally complementary in mitigating opportunism, a singular focus on either contractual or relational can be just as effective under situations of high individualism and collectivism, respectively.

We argue that the simultaneous use of behavior and outcome control capitalizes on their respective advantages, and is therefore more effective than a sole reliance on either control type. Moreover, with organizational control seeking alignment between individual and organizational goals, the benefits of such a complementary approach may be more pronounced in a context characterized by high levels of organizational politics, or the pursuit of individual at the expense of organizational goals. Our analysis of strategic initiatives pursued by 184 European corporations provides support for both a complementary approach to organizational control and a contingency effect of organizational politics.

For those restating firms that do receive takeover bids, the bids are more likely to be withdrawn or take longer to complete than those made to non-restating firms. Finally, there is some evidence that deal value multiples are significantly lower for restating targets than for non-restating targets.

While endogeneity cannot be ruled out fully, the results of a battery of tests suggest that it plays a limited role.

Clawbacks have been shown to reduce financial misstatements and increase investors' confidence on earnings information. We show that the benefits come with an unintended consequence of certain firms substituting for accruals management with real transactions management (e.g., reduce research and development [R&D] expenditures), especially firms with strong incentives to achieve short-term earnings targets, such as firms with high growth or high transient institutional ownership. As such, the total amount of earnings management does not decrease subsequent to clawback adoption. We further show that although real transactions management temporarily boosts those clawback adopters' short-term profitability and stock performance, this trend reverses after three years. In summary, clawbacks may have unexpected effects for a subset of firms whose managers are under greater pressure to meet earnings goals.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/147/3661/Substitution-between-Real-and-Accruals-Based","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['compensation', 'financial misstatements', 'earnings management']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and clawback provisions without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We find that nominal teams generate a significantly larger number of unique fraud risk factors and fraud hypotheses than interacting teams. Nominal teams also generate higher-quality fraud hypotheses. We provide evidence that social loafing by less experienced auditors in interacting teams drives the differences between nominal and interacting teams in the fraud hypothesis generation task. In addition, less experienced auditors have less developed mental simulations for frauds in interacting teams compared to those in nominal teams.

We find the stock market impact for our treatment sample to be positively related to our proxy for cost savings and negatively related to the pre-adoption reconciliation magnitude from IFRS to U.S. GAAP.

Using hand-collected data from Standard & Poor's (S&P) 1500 firms' disclosures of the use of customer satisfaction measures in executive bonus contracts in 2006 and 2010 proxy statements, we find results consistent with our prediction. Our results are robust to alternative measures of competition type and competition intensity. We also find similar results when we use the weight on customer satisfaction measures in executive bonus contracts as the dependent variable.

In contrast, IFRS adoption has no effect on crash risk for financial firms, on average, but decreases crash risk among firms less affected by IFRS's fair value provisions, and increases crash risk among banks in countries with weak banking regulations. Overall, our results are consistent with the increased transparency from IFRS adoption broadly reducing crash risk among nonfinancial firms, but more selectively among financial firms, and with financial regulations playing a complementary role in implementing IFRS among financial firms.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/265/3729/Does-Mandatory-IFRS-Adoption-Affect-Crash-Risk","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IFRS adoption and its impact on crash risk without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine two ways in which disclosing more risks can actually lower investors' perceptions of risk. Utilizing an experiment, we find evidence of two unintended consequences on different types of investors. First, we demonstrate that the addition of low-probability risks to a disclosure can dilute (rather than add to) more probable losses, leading certain investors to lower their perceptions of overall risk. Second, since lowering the threshold changes the overall composition of the disclosure by adding low-probability losses, firms could adopt a tactic of minimization that characterizes the entire disclosure as unimportant, presenting the lowest risks most saliently, using compliance with the low threshold as a plausible reason for giving a lengthy disclosure of generally unimportant risks. Our findings suggest that such a tactic can be persuasive.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/301/3635/Unintended-Consequences-of-Lowering-Disclosure","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['disclosure', 'risks', 'investors']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial disclosure and investor perception without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

This experiment investigates how two exogenous constraints that superiors can face in budget negotiation settings, increased opportunity costs and financial pressure to meet unit targets, affect budget negotiations and subordinate effort. The results show that both constraints induce more cooperation, but in different ways. Financial pressure on the superior leads to more cooperative negotiation behavior by superiors and subordinates than increased opportunity costs. Specifically, subordinates do not take advantage of the superior's increased financial pressure to enforce lower budgets. After negotiation, both constraints strongly mitigate the negative effects of superior budget imposition on subordinate effort because exogenous constraints eliminate the effect of procedural fairness considerations on subordinate effort.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/31/3620/The-Effect-of-Superiors-Exogenous-Constraints-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['cooperation', 'financial pressure', 'procedural fairness']","The article discusses cooperation and procedural fairness in budget negotiations, which touches on ethical considerations in organizational behavior.

We argue that this inconsistency stems from not considering detection mechanisms that mitigate the effect of equity incentives on misreporting by limiting the ability of managers to carry out such manipulative activities. Using auditor industry expertise as one such detection mechanism, we document that CEO equity incentives are positively associated with misreporting only in subsamples where auditor expertise is low, but not where expertise is high. The implication of these results is that auditor expertise lowers the cost of granting equity-based incentives and that firms audited by an industry expert grant their CEOs greater equity incentives. We find strong evidence in favor of this implication. Controlling for previously identified determinants of CEO equity incentives, we find that firms audited by an industry expert grant their CEOs 14 percent more equity incentives than firms audited by a non-expert. To address endogeneity concerns, we use the collapse of Arthur Andersen as a quasi-natural experiment and find analogous evidence. Overall, our study documents the critical role of detection mechanisms in the link between CEO contracting and financial misreporting.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/321/3712/CEO-Equity-Incentives-and-Financial-Misreporting","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['financial misreporting', 'auditor expertise', 'equity incentives']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of CEO equity incentives and financial misreporting, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

As a result, we train lower-level auditors to use a sequential thought process comprised of two metacognitive skills: divergent thinking, where they generate explanations for unusual evidence, followed by convergent thinking, where they evaluate explanations generated and eliminate those judged infeasible. To test the efficacy of our training, we conducted an experiment with three conditions: both divergent and convergent thinking, divergent thinking only, and a control. We found that training auditors in only divergent thinking increases both the number and quality of explanations generated for an unusual situation.

We also manipulate the readability of trend performance in our main experiment. Our results show that when benchmark performance is inconsistent, higher as opposed to lower readability of positive (negative) trend performance leads to more (less) favorable investors' performance judgments. This effect of readability is smaller when benchmark performance is consistent. We also show that higher readability in the inconsistent benchmark performance condition improves investors' understanding of the firm's current-quarter performance, which in turn influences their judgments on the firm's future performance.

Relying on Social Identity Theory, I examine mechanisms for promoting auditor independence that can be implemented regardless of auditor tenure or rotation. I conduct two experiments in a setting with no prior auditor-client history. As predicted, auditors who identify more strongly with their clients, by sharing their values, agree more with the client's preferred accounting treatment, unless the salience or arousal of their professional identity is heightened. Further, as predicted, heightening professional identity salience increases professional skepticism. My results provide an improved understanding of the joint effects of identity strength and salience on auditor judgments and suggest a cost-effective alternative to auditor rotation to maintain auditor independence, even when auditor tenure is short.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/1/95/3672/The-Effects-of-Client-Identity-Strength-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['identity', 'independence', 'values']","The article discusses auditor independence in relation to client identity and professional identity salience, touching on themes of identity and values.

Our findings suggest that the PCAOB censure was associated with a decrease in Deloitte's ability to retain clients and attract new clients, and a decrease in Deloitte's audit fee growth rates. However, methodologies used in extant archival studies yield little or no evidence to suggest that Deloitte's audit quality was different from that of the other Big 4 firms during a three-year window either before or after the censure. Overall, our results suggest that the PCAOB censure imposed actual costs on Deloitte.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/2/405/3722/Did-the-2007-PCAOB-Disciplinary-Order-against","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial and operational impacts of a disciplinary order on Deloitte without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition, the relative increase in CEO compensation appears to come from nonprofits that have experienced greater regulatory cost increases.

This calls into question the role of honesty in participative budgeting settings. Using Rankin et al.'s (2008) manipulation to capture honesty effects, we examine the robustness of honesty effects on budget proposals when the superior has rejection authority in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we document that honesty has a strong effect on budgetary slack when the salience of distributional fairness is reduced by withholding the relative pay of the superior from the subordinate. In Experiment 2, we document that honesty continues to have a strong effect on budgetary slack when the salience of reciprocity is increased by giving the superior the ability to set the subordinate's salary. Thus, our evidence suggests that honesty effects on budget proposals are generally robust to giving the superior rejection authority.

However, regulators do not enforce IAF quality or require disclosures relating to IAF quality, which is in stark contrast to regulatory requirements placed on boards, audit committees, and external auditors. Using proprietary data, I find that a composite measure of IAF quality is negatively associated with the likelihood of management misconduct even after controlling for board, audit committee, and external auditor quality. This result is robust to a variety of other specifications, including controlling for internal control quality and separate estimation during the pre- and post-SOX time periods. A difference-in-differences analysis indicates that misconduct firms have low IAF quality and competence during misconduct years and improve IAF quality and competence in the post-misconduct years. These findings suggest that regulators, audit committees, and other stakeholders should consider ways to improve IAF quality.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/2/495/3733/Does-Internal-Audit-Function-Quality-Deter","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['misconduct', 'regulators', 'stakeholders']","The article discusses management misconduct and the role of internal audit functions in monitoring behavior, which touches on ethical oversight but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or DEI themes.

We also find that inventory turnover rates increase for firms that remediate material weaknesses related to inventory tracking. Remediating firms also experience increases in sales, gross profit, and operating cash flows. Finally, we assess the generalizability of our findings by examining all material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, regardless of type, and provide evidence that firms' returns on assets are associated with both their existence and remediation.

We examine how experienced audit reviewers respond when reviewing an audit preparer's judgment that appears to be biased by the preparer's affect toward a client's controller. In our experiment, reviewers are provided with a preparer's judgment that appears inconsistent with the audit workpapers. We then examine the effect of providing versus not providing reviewers with a cue about the preparer's positive or negative affect toward the controller. We find that despite reviewers' belief that affect biases a preparer's judgment, reviewers who are informed of the preparer's affect do not rely less on the preparer's judgment. Instead, they actually rely more on the preparer's judgment than do those who are not informed about the preparer's affect. This result is consistent with Wegner's (1994) ironic rebound effect, which predicts that sometimes when individuals are trying not to rely on information, they ironically rely on it more.

Among firms with greater product market power and comparatively high cash tax avoidance, we find stock prices to be less informative and that investors require additional compensation for the risks associated with comparatively high cash tax avoidance.

We conduct two experiments in which participants act as CEO of a multi-division electronics company that suffers a large asset impairment at one of the divisions. Drawing on prior psychology research involving cognitive dissonance and decision reversibility, we predict and find that managers who are responsible for the decision to record the asset impairment invest more in the impaired division when the accounting effect of the impairment is reversible than when it is irreversible. This is consistent with the idea that reversible accounting effects encourage behavioral attempts to alter the cash flow outcome, while irreversible accounting effects encourage belief revision to rationalize the cash flow outcome. Also in line with cognitive dissonance theory, we show that managers who are not responsible for the decision to impair the asset, or managers who are given the opportunity to deny responsibility for the asset impairment, do not differ in their investment in the impaired division, regardless of impairment reversibility.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/2/739/3662/Impaired-Judgment-The-Effects-of-Asset-Impairment","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and investment decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The benefit of dissemination is that when productivity states are correlated, each agent's signal is useful as a performance measure for the other agent and for making efficient production choices. The more informative the signal is about agents' efforts, the greater the benefit of the additional performance measure, but there is a cost due to higher information rents. With no dissemination, the downstream agent learns about the upstream agent's productivity state by observing that agent's effort. The upstream agent's rents are lower because he has no incentive to free-ride on the downstream agent, who follows his effort, but there is less information on which to base the payments.

I find that, compared to most other types of college education, accounting education quality has been steady or increasing over the sample period. However, relative to other business degree programs, the evidence is mixed. The quality of students self-selecting non-accounting business degrees has increased while the quality of accounting students has not. The disparity in student quality is not reflected in the pay received by accounting graduates, which has remained stable relative to the pay received by graduates with other business degrees, although this result is likely influenced by regulatory changes during the 2000s, including Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX).

Consequences of the Failure to Report Existing Internal Control Weaknesses","We examine various penalties that could serve as enforcement mechanisms for Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404. We focus on firms with restatements, some of which had previously reported their control weaknesses as required and some of which acknowledged them only after announcing their restatement. We find no evidence that penalties are more likely for firms, managers, or auditors that fail to report existing control weaknesses. Instead, class action lawsuits, management turnover, and auditor turnover are all more likely in the wake of a restatement when control weaknesses had previously been reported. We find similar, although weaker, evidence for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sanctions. These results are consistent with disclosure of control weaknesses making it difficult for management to plausibly claim later that they were unaware of the underlying conditions that led to restatements. The results also suggest that the public and private enforcement mechanisms surrounding SOX 404 are unlikely to provide strong incentives for compliance and offer a potential explanation for why most restatements are issued by firms that previously claimed to have effective internal controls.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/3/1169/3691/Does-SOX-404-Have-Teeth-Consequences-of-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['internal control', 'disclosure', 'penalties']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of compliance and enforcement mechanisms related to Sarbanes-Oxley, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We find that the restatement rate of U.S.-listed foreign firms is significantly lower than that of comparable U.S. firms and that the difference depends on the firm's home country characteristics. Foreign firms from countries with a weak rule of law are less likely to restate than are firms from strong rule of law countries. While the lower rate of restatements can represent an absence of errors, it can also indicate a lack of detection and disclosure of errors and irregularities. We infer the effect of detection and disclosure by associating the frequency of restatements with the quality of the firm's internal control system. We find that only U.S. firms and foreign firms from strong rule of law countries show a positive association between restatement frequency and internal control weaknesses. Firms from weak rule of law countries show no significant association. We interpret these findings as home country enforcement affecting firms' likelihood of detecting and reporting existing accounting misstatements. This suggests that for U.S.-listed foreign firms, less frequent restatements can be a signal of opportunistic reporting rather than a lack of accounting errors and irregularities.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/3/1201/3747/Admitting-Mistakes-Home-Country-Effect-on-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['restatement', 'rule of law', 'disclosure']","The article discusses the implications of home country characteristics on accounting practices, touching on themes of transparency and governance.

Our first set of results shows how the incentive weights that owners place on revenues are affected by firm characteristics and by whether their manager chooses ex ante voluntary disclosure. This arises because the owners choose how sensitive the manager's compensation is to her production choice and, because this sensitivity is naturally greater if the manager opts to disclose, owners substitute disclosure for direct contractual incentives. Owners also substitute a rival firm's disclosures for direct incentives. Finally, we show that joint delegation alters the information environment for competing firms by creating incentives to provide more information about the less aggressive competitor and less information about the more aggressive competitor.

Results show that fraud specialists did not differ from auditors in the number of procedures selected from a standard audit program; nor were these procedures cumulatively more effective than those selected by auditors. Fraud specialists generated a greater number of non-standard additional audit procedures, and those procedures were marginally more effective, but less efficient, than those of auditors, except for certain groups of procedures. Finally, although the fraud specialists proposed significantly more additional (non-standard) procedures than auditors, their proposed budget increase for this category of procedures was significantly smaller than the budget increase proposed by auditors.

However, this strategy may be ineffective in an incomplete-contract environment because the new workers may provide lower effort in response to their lower wages, and hiring new lower-wage workers may damage the remaining original workers' reciprocal relationship with the firm. We conduct an experiment to examine this issue and find that when new lower-wage workers become available, firms hire them to replace original higher-wage workers and pay the new workers lower wages. However, these lower wages do not improve firm profit because the decision to hire new lower-wage workers causes both the new and remaining workers to provide lower effort. Moreover, hiring lower-wage workers reduces new workers' payoffs and, thus, decreases social welfare. These unintended consequences suggest that firms should consider both the wage savings and the potential costs when deciding whether to replace some workers with new lower-wage workers.

We find that when the interbank competition is less intense, an improvement in the quality of accounting information encourages banks to take more risk. Keeping the banks' investments in loans constant, the provision of high-quality accounting information reduces the false-alarm cost of assets sales and improves the discriminating efficiency of the capital requirement policy. When considering the banks' endogenous investment decisions, however, this improvement in discriminating efficiency causes excessive risk-taking, because banks respond by competing more aggressively in the deposit market, and the increase in deposit costs motivates banks to take more risk.

Our results indicate that industry specialists charge incrementally lower fees in industries with homogenous operations, and particularly in industries with both homogenous operations and complex accounting practices. Moreover, we discover that audit quality is no lower for clients audited by these specialists offering fee discounts, consistent with a conclusion that the reduction in fees indicates cost efficiencies rather than lower-quality audits. Further analysis indicates that the shared economies of scale only occur in a subsample of client firms with relatively high bargaining power. When considered in conjunction with prior research using a survivorship approach, our study provides evidence that certain industries lend themselves to specialization because auditors generate cost-based competitive advantages without compromising service quality.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1721/3711/Auditor-Industry-Specialization-and-Evidence-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit pricing and cost efficiencies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that this situation is driven by some principals and agents having an implicit agreement where the principal \u201callows\u201d the agent to receive economic rents from positive performance-target deviations that are the result of superior effort or transitory gains by not revising targets upward, while the agent \u201caccepts\u201d target revisions by not restricting output when these revisions are the result of structural changes in the operation's true economic capacity. Although both the principal and the agent can benefit from an implicit agreement, we argue that for the implicit agreement to be maintainable, the principal either needs information on the cause of the performance-target deviation or there needs to be trust between the principal and the agent. Using archival data across multiple years and independent bank units, we find a pattern of ratchet attenuation and output restriction that is consistent with the existence of implicit agreements for those principal-agent dyads where information asymmetry is sufficiently reduced or mutual trust exists.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1755/3673/Performance-Target-Revisions-in-Incentive","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of performance target revisions and the dynamics of principal-agent relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We hypothesize that the agencies have stronger incentives to monitor issuers when providing initial versus post-issuance ratings. We document that initial ratings are positively associated with off-balance sheet securitized assets and incrementally associated with on-balance sheet retained securities. However, subsequent ratings fail to capture current exposure to off-balance sheet securitizations. We also find that subsequent ratings reflect default risk less accurately than initial ratings. The subsequent ratings' responsiveness to default risk is worse when a bank has more off-balance sheet securitized assets. Collectively, our findings are consistent with lax post-issuance monitoring. They raise questions about the effectiveness of using ratings as an ongoing contracting mechanism and suggest that conclusions about rating accuracy could differ depending on whether researchers focus on initial versus post-issuance ratings.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1779/3736/The-Effectiveness-of-Credit-Rating-Agency","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit rating agency monitoring and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

In our model, both a monopolist (strategic) informed trader and uninformed traders consider the impact of their demands on prices. In contrast to settings with price-taking traders, private information never eliminates a priced risk, and can lead to higher risk premiums. Also unlike settings with price-taking informed traders, risk premiums decrease in response to an increase in liquidity-motivated trades in diversified portfolios. These differing effects arise because a privately informed strategic trader conceals her trades by taking small positions relative to the magnitude of noise trades. Although prices partially reveal her information and reduce uncertainty, a concomitant decrease in her risk absorption dominates and leads to higher risk premiums. Similar to settings with price-taking traders, private information affects expected returns only via factor loadings and risk premiums on existing payoff risks\u2014it introduces no new priced risks, and factor loadings (betas) explain all cross-sectional differences in expected returns.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1811/3752/Strategic-Informed-Trades-Diversification-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and expected returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, these studies do not consider the role of institutions in affecting firms' ability to exercise growth and adaptation options. In this study, we investigate whether these convex relations vary with the degree of a country's economic freedom, which may influence the frictions and costs of exercising these options. We develop four hypotheses: In countries with greater economic freedom: (1) a firm's capital investment in response to profitability is greater; (2) the relation between equity value and earnings, given equity book value, is more convex; (3) the relation between equity value and equity book value, given earnings, is more convex; and (4) the relation between stock return and profitability change is more convex. Using the Economic Freedom of the World index from the Fraser Institute, we test our hypotheses with data from 30 countries during the 2000\u20132010 period. The empirical results are consistent with these hypotheses. The effect of economic freedom that we document is distinct from the effects of GDP level and growth, legal origin, law enforcement, investor protection, and quality of accounting standards. Our results suggest that greater economic freedom enhances equity value through more efficient management of investment options.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1839/3658/Economic-Freedom-Investment-Flexibility-and-Equity","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on economic freedom and investment flexibility without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

We also find some evidence that a proxy for the funded status of a firm's MEPPs is incrementally value relevant over and above the firm's cash contributions, but no evidence that it is credit relevant.

U.S. firms using U.S. GAAP rely more heavily on real methods than non-U.S. firms that use either IFRS or U.S. GAAP and U.S. firms using IFRS. U.S. firms using U.S. GAAP operate in an environment that encourages real over accruals methods; specifically, U.S. GAAP facilitates detection of earnings management, and enforcement is more effective in the U.S. Further, the likelihood and amount of earnings management do not differ across conditions, suggesting that firms using less accruals earnings management tend to fully compensate by increasing real methods. So stronger reporting environments do not necessarily reduce total earnings management, but instead encourage substitution of real for accruals methods.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/1969/3685/Reporting-Regulatory-Environments-and-Earnings","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and earnings management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper proposes a novel approach to distinguish between risk and anomaly explanations for the negative association between accruals and returns. The intuition is that high-risk stocks should experience relatively high and low returns more often than low-risk stocks. Thus, a variable that has the opposite correlations with high returns than with low returns is unlikely to capture risk, which points toward an anomaly. The paper implements this perspective via two logistic regressions predicting relatively high and low returns. Controlling for standard risk measures, we document that low accruals increase the probability of large positive returns, but reduce the likelihood of large negative returns. This finding is inconsistent with the prediction that accruals reflect risk and supports the hypothesis that the accrual \u201canomaly\u201d is indeed an anomaly.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/5/2057/3638/Risk-versus-Anomaly-A-New-Methodology-Applied-to","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of accruals and their relationship with risk and returns, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Managers, for example, can time regular poison pill adoptions, but have limited ability to time in-play pill adoptions. Thus, I test whether real-time reporting deters disclosure bunching around the disclosures of regular and in-play poison pill adoptions to examine whether managers' ability to time events affects whether real-time reporting deters strategic disclosure. I find that real-time reporting does not deter disclosure bunching for regular poison pills, but does deter it for in-play pills.

Specifically, we argue that firms are likely to alter resource procurement choices to increase cost elasticity in response to these two risk drivers. We use data from California hospitals that allow for the calibration of three distinct resource procurement choices that increase cost elasticity: outsourcing, leasing of equipment, and hiring contract labor. Mediation analysis using 2,202 hospital year observations indicates that both demand uncertainty and financial risk influence cost elasticity. Importantly, these effects are mediated by the three aforementioned resource procurement choices.

Such contagion is absent when the restating firm is disciplined by the SEC or class action lawsuits, suggesting deterrent effects of enforcement activity. Contagion among peers is observed (1) in the same account as the one restated by the target firm, or (2) when larger target firms restate or the restatement is prominently disclosed, or (3) when the target firm's restatement is less severe. Contagion stops during the years 2003\u20132005, possibly due to the enforcement associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), but reappears during 2006\u20132008, perhaps because the sting associated with SOX has worn off.

In support of the theories' predictions, we find a positive association between the information sensitivity of securities and the likelihood of their issuance after earnings announcements. In particular, we find that clustering after earnings announcements is weakest in loan originations, stronger in bond offerings, and strongest in equity offerings. Also consistent with the theories, we find that the size of news in earnings announcements matters in the timing decision.

We examine European real estate firms reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which require that fair values for investment properties, our sample firms' key operating asset, either be recognized on the balance sheet or disclosed in the footnotes. Consistent with prior research, we predict and find a lower association between equity prices and disclosed relative to recognized investment property fair values, reflecting a discount applied to disclosed fair values. We then predict and find that this discount is mitigated by lower information processing costs (proxied via high analyst following), and some support that it is also mitigated by higher reliability (proxied via use of external appraisals). These latter results are documented using subsample analyses to test one attribute (either information processing costs or reliability) while holding the other constant. Overall, these findings are consistent with fair value reliability and information processing costs providing complementary explanations for observed pricing discounts assessed on disclosed accounting amounts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/6/2411/3800/Recognition-versus-Disclosure-of-Fair-Values","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of fair value accounting and investor behavior without addressing social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

We first examine how these measures relate to earnings quality. Accounting consistency over time is positively associated with a number of earnings quality proxies, including earnings persistence, predictability, accrual quality, and absolute discretionary accruals. We also find that lower consistency relative to other firms in the industry is associated with larger absolute accrual model residuals. Finally, we examine the information processing effects of accounting consistency. We find that greater accounting consistency in the time-series and the cross-section is associated with lower information asymmetry, as proxied by bid-ask spread and illiquidity. Greater cross-sectional consistency is also associated with greater analyst coverage, more accurate analyst forecasts, decreased dispersion in analyst forecasts, and stronger stock return synchronicity.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/6/2483/3808/The-Earnings-Quality-and-Information-Processing","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting consistency and earnings quality without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

An Investigation into Financial Reporting Executives' Decision-Making during the Restatement Process","Prior archival studies find that firms that voluntarily adopted clawback policies have experienced a reduction in restatements. I experimentally examine this outcome by investigating the influence of two key factors (i.e., executive compensation structure and auditor quality) on financial reporting executives' (hereafter, \u201cexecutives\u201d) decision-making regarding a proposed restatement that will lead to a clawback of their incentives. I find that executives (i.e., CFOs, controllers, and treasurers) facing a lower quality auditor are less likely to agree with amending prior financial statements when a higher proportion of their pay is incentive-based. However, this tendency is reduced when executives face a higher quality auditor, indicating that higher quality auditors can act as effective monitors. My results identify an ex post unintended consequence of clawback regulation that could at least partially offset the benefits of the ex ante deterrent effects of clawbacks, and that could contribute to findings of less frequent restatements when clawback policies are in place. I discuss potential implications regarding the role of executives during restatement decisions and auditors' risk assessments in a clawback environment.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/6/2515/3741/Why-do-Restatements-Decrease-in-a-Clawback","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['clawback', 'executive compensation', 'auditor quality']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of financial reporting and executive decision-making, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The Economic Consequences of Low-Quality Audits","This study investigates whether the market for audit clients penalizes auditors following association with low-quality audits. Specifically, we examine whether audit offices experience a loss in local market share following client restatements. We document that the frequency of restatement announcements within an office-year (\u201ccontamination\u201d) is inversely related to subsequent year-over-year change in local market share. Further analysis indicates that restatements impair the office's ability to both attract and retain audit clients. We find that this effect is strongest in high competition markets and diminished in low competition markets. We also examine auditor retention decisions at the client level and find that the likelihood of auditor dismissal increases with contamination, even for non-restating clients. We also find that, on average, clients dismissing their auditor select less contaminated audit offices. Taken together, our results suggest that market forces penalize auditors for association with audit failures, thereby providing an incentive to maintain high-quality audits and protect reputational capital.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/6/2537/3714/Do-Clients-Avoid-Contaminated-Offices-The-Economic","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['audit', 'quality', 'market share']","The article focuses primarily on the economic consequences of low-quality audits and market dynamics, with no significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Empirical tests using firms from 15 European Union (EU) countries over the period 1997\u20132011 (with comparable peers selected from the entire cross-section of foreign firms) document significant improvement in valuation performance measured as pricing accuracy, the ability of value estimates to explain cross-sectional variation in observed price, and the ability of the pricing multiple to predict future market-to-book multiples. Findings for a series of identification tests suggest that enhanced valuation performance is the consequence of improvements in the degree of cross-border accounting comparability that occurred during the sample window, and that a significant fraction of comparability gain operates through improved peer selection.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/90/6/2571/3758/Accounting-Comparability-and-the-Accuracy-of-Peer","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting comparability and valuation performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.
