In response, I develop and test a framework for understanding MNC risk and investment behavior based on political business cycle considerations. Analyses of 408 MNC investments worth $199 billion in 18 developing countries holding 35 presidential elections from 1987 through 2000 are consistent with these considerations: MNCS perceive higher (lower) risk and announce fewer (more) investment projects as right-wing (left-wing) incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2008.30679060","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['political risk', 'investment behavior', 'developing countries']","The article focuses on multinational corporations' investment behaviors in relation to political cycles in developing countries, which touches on economic policies but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We theorize that founders with pre-founding industry experience in non-local populations are more likely to adopt locally novel forms. Pre-founding experience within local and non-local industry populations should also allow organizations to reach larger size and produce superior quality products, both of which contribute to the persistence of the novel organizational form. We evaluate these predictions in an analysis of the transformation of the population of Israeli wineries between 1983 and 2004, when five existing organizations witnessed the arrival of 138 new wineries. This explosion in numbers coincided with a shift from kosher toward non-kosher wine production, the new organizational form. Although the four largest Israeli wineries in 1982 were kosher, roughly 75 percent of the new entrants were established as non-kosher producers. We analyze how founders' pre-founding experiences helped the novel non-kosher form penetrate the local population. The results show that non-local wine industry experience prior to founding increased the odds that a new entrant would select the non-kosher organizational form. At the same time, both local and non-local pre-founding experience improved the size and product-quality outcomes achieved by the non-kosher entrants. This had an additional effect on form penetration by improving the impact and longevity of the novel-form producers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.53.2.235","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['organizational forms', 'local populations', 'pre-founding experience']","The article discusses the impact of founders' experiences on organizational forms, but it primarily focuses on business outcomes rather than social justice or equity themes.

In an empirical analysis of our thesis in the formation of syndicate relations between U.S. venture capital firms from 1985 to 2007, we find that the probability that geographically and industry distant ties will form between venture capital firms increases with several attributes of the target-company investment setting: (1) the recent popularity of investing in the target firm's industry and home region, (2) the target company's maturity, (3) the size of the investment syndicate, and (4) the density of relationships among the other members of the syndicate.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.53.2.266","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['relationship formation', 'social dimensions', 'homogenous clusters']","The article discusses relationship formation in venture capital networks, touching on social dimensions and the diversity of ties.

Results from analyses of a sample of corporate boycotts reported in major national newspapers in the U.S. between 1990 and 2005 provide support for the political mediation model.

Using a dataset on the diffusion of domestic partner benefits in the Fortune 500 from 1990 to 2005, we show that widespread adoption among mainstream firms was triggered by the prior adoptions of companies known to resist activism. We also find that employee activist groups within firms played a different role depending on the company's orientation toward activism. Employee groups increased the likelihood of adoption in activism-prone firms, but in mainstream firms, they increased the susceptibility of the firm to prior adoptions by others. These findings support a view of institutionalization as a contested process and suggest an alternative mechanism through which social networks influence that process. Like the effect of Cold-War President Richard Nixon's surprising visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972, which led other countries to open relations with China, adoption of a practice by activism-resistant firms signaled to mainstream firms that an advocated practice had lost its contentiousness. Rather than providing pressure toward conformity, adoption events in a firm's environment can be seen as a cultural resource that supports or undermines the arguments made by proponents of change inside organizations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.53.3.460","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","7","['activism', 'contentious practices', 'employee groups', 'institutionalization']","The article discusses the role of activism and contentious practices in organizational change, indicating a focus on social dynamics and institutionalization processes influenced by activism.

Communications networks fueled by print media transmitted news about the movement to the public and so helped mobilize a broad base of support. Among social institutions, churches were especially supportive because their emphasis on morality and community was conducive to antislavery activism. Our analysis focuses on the founding of antislavery societies, the formal organizations that underpinned this movement, and makes three contributions to our understanding of social movement organizations in general and antislavery societies in particular. First, we show that the impact of mass media was strong as far back as the early nineteenth century and that the growth of magazines spurred antislavery society formation. Second, we demonstrate that theology, specifically an orientation toward this world or heaven, determined whether religious resources were available to antislavery organizations. This-worldly religions supported abolition organizing, while other-worldly religions undermined it. Third, we resolve an important causal ambiguity in debates about antislavery by showing that the development of the media was the cause, not merely a consequence of or companion to growth of antislavery organizations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.53.3.492","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","9","['antislavery', 'activism', 'morality', 'social movement', 'community']","The article focuses on the historical context of the antislavery movement, emphasizing social justice themes such as activism and morality.

Our analysis of 15 years of longitudinal data on 124 Japanese, European, and U.S. industrial automation organizations reconciles these views. Results show that firms introduce more new products if they search after their competitors do, and they introduce more innovative new products if they search ahead of their competitors. The most innovative firms combine these two approaches, bridging their own and their rivals' hitherto isolated clusters of knowledge, but avoid engaging in learning contests in which they search at the same time as their rivals. The key insight for innovating firms, then, is not necessarily to strive to perform as well as possible in absolute terms, but to be different from the competition.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.53.4.593","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on product innovation and competitive strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The enhanced query, represented by the refined semantic net, can be executed by search engines. This paper describes the methodology and its implementation in a prototype.

An Economic Analysis of Software Security Patch Restrictions","We study the question of whether a software vendor should allow users of unlicensed (pirated) copies of a software product to apply security patches. We present a joint model of network software security and software piracy and contrast two policies that a software vendor can enforce: (i) restriction of security patches only to legitimate users or (ii) provision of access to security patches to all users whether their copies are licensed or not. We find that when the software security risk is high and the piracy enforcement level is low, or when tendency for piracy in the consumer population is high, it is optimal for the vendor to restrict unlicensed users from applying security patches. When piracy tendency in the consumer population is low, applying software security patch restrictions is optimal for the vendor only when the piracy enforcement level is high. If patching costs are sufficiently low, however, an unrestricted patch release policy maximizes vendor profits. We also show that the vendor can use security patch restrictions as a substitute to investment in software security, and this effect can significantly reduce welfare. Furthermore, in certain cases, increased piracy enforcement levels can actually hurt vendor profits. We also show that governments can increase social surplus and intellectual property protection simultaneously by increasing piracy enforcement and utilizing the strategic interaction of piracy patch restrictions and network security. Finally, we demonstrate that, although unrestricted patching can maximize welfare when the piracy enforcement level is low, contrary to what one might expect, when the piracy enforcement level is high, restricting security patches only to licensed users can be socially optimal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0142","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['security', 'piracy', 'welfare']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of software security and piracy, with limited emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Various methods have been proposed to determine the effective level of security investment. However, traditional expected value methods (such as annual loss expectancy) cannot fully characterize the information security risk confronted by organizations, considering some extremal yet perhaps relatively rare cases in which a security failure may be critical and cause high losses. In this research note we introduce the concept of value-at-risk to measure the risk of daily losses an organization faces due to security exploits and use extreme value analysis to quantitatively estimate the value at risk. We collect a set of internal daily activity data from a large financial institution in the northeast United States and then simulate its daily losses with information based on data snapshots and interviews with security managers at the institution. We illustrate our methods using these simulated daily losses. With this approach, decision makers can make a proper investment choice based on their own risk preference instead of pursuing a solution that minimizes only the expected cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0143","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information security investment without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes, which are essential for a higher woke score."],["2008","19","1","Milind DawandeMilind Dawandemilind@utdallas.eduSchool of Management and the School of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75083Search for more papers by this author, Monica JoharMonica Joharmsjohar@uncc.eduThe Belk College of Business, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina 28223Search for more papers by this author, Subodha KumarSubodha Kumarsubodha@u.washington.eduMichael G.

To this end, we develop analytical models to optimize module-developer assignments in each of these approaches. These models are shown to be strongly NP-hard and solved using a genetic algorithm. The solo and pair development approaches are compared for a variety of problem instances to highlight project characteristics that favor one of the two practices. We also propose a simple criterion that can reliably recommend the appropriate approach for a given problem instance. Typically, for efficient knowledge sharing between developers or for highly connected systems, the pair programming approach is preferable. Also, the pair approach is better at leveraging expertise by pairing experts with less skilled partners. Solo programming is usually desirable if the system is large or the effort needed either to form a pair or to code efficiently in pairs is high. Solo programming is also appropriate for projects with a tight deadline, whereas the reverse is true for projects with a lenient deadline. The mixed approach (i.e., an approach where both the solo and pair practices are used in the same project) is only indicated when the system consists of groups of modules that are sufficiently different from one another.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0147","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of programming methodologies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this research we conceptualize and model an Internet-based storage provisioning network for rich-media content delivery. This is modeled as a capacity provision network (CPN) where participants possess service infrastructures and leverage their topographies to effectively serve specific customer segments. A CPN is a network of SPs coordinated through an allocation hub. We first develop the notion of discounted QoS capabilities of storage resources. We then investigate the stability of the discount factors over time and the network topography using a test-bed on the Internet through a longitudinal empirical study. Finally, we develop a market maker mechanism for optimal multilateral allocation and surplus sharing in a network. The proposed CPN is closely tied to two fundamental properties of Internet service technology: positive network externality among cooperating SPs and the property of effective multiplication of capacity allocation among several distributed service sites. We show that there exist significant incentives for SPs to engage in cooperative allocation and surplus sharing. We further demonstrate that intermediation can enhance the allocation effectiveness and that the opportunity to allocation and surplus sharing can play an important role in infrastructure planning. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the practical business viability of a cooperative CPN market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0145","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource management and service delivery without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Online Information Search and Channel Outcomes in Auto Retailing","The growth of the Internet has spawned an increasing number of online information sources (OISs). The effect of OISs on consumer information search processes has been particularly striking in sectors such as auto retailing, where the typical consumer has conventionally been confronted with an unpleasant and inefficient purchase process. However, the relationships between the information found in the online \u201cmarketspace,\u201d consumer search in the offline \u201cmarketplace,\u201d and other aspects of the multichannel shopping process are not well understood. This study examines the differential impact of price and product information found in the marketspace, relating consumers' information needs and information retrieval from OISs to three shopping-related outcomes\u2014purchase based on online infomediary referral (i.e., referred purchase), intensity of search in the marketplace, and online search satisfaction. We draw on a large data set of more than 16,000 new vehicle purchasers who reported using the Web for search related to their new vehicle purchase. We find that OISs offer different levels of price and product information and consumers are differentiated in their ability to retrieve this information. Further, the retrieval of price versus product information online has important implications for whether consumers consummate their online search through referred purchase or extend their search into the physical marketplace. Our results suggest different business models for infomediaries providing price and product information and underscore the need for designing information provisioning systems of OISs to facilitate transition between the marketspace and the marketplace.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0146","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['consumer', 'information', 'search']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of online information sources and consumer behavior in auto retailing, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This research raises two questions. First, Is the relative importance of various profit drivers different across two contractual regimes? Second, Does it follow that vendors unconditionally prefer T&M contracts for all projects? We address these questions by using data on 93 offshore projects completed by a leading Indian vendor. We use an endogenous switching regression framework and the program evaluation methodology to show that profit equations are distinctly different for the two contractual regimes. Using these two profit equations, we also identify contingencies under which the vendor prefers an FP contract to a T&M contract. We hypothesize that the vendor's ability leverage information asymmetry about capabilities and experiences translates into the vendor preferring FP contract to secure larger information rents. Our results support this hypothesis and suggest that the vendor would prefer the FP contract for larger and longer projects with larger teams. However, vendors would prefer a T&M contract when the risk of employee attrition from the project team is high. In addition, we discuss managerial implications of these results in the paper.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0162","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on profit drivers and contractual preferences in offshore software projects without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For example, Amazon.com does not just sell books; it also enhances that core product with automated product recommendations, \u201cwish list\u201d tracking, order status updates, customer reviews, and many other valuable supporting services. These supporting services are made possible exclusively through the design and deployment of information technology (IT) to provide website supporting services functionality (SSF). In this paper, we define and develop the concept of B2C SSF and investigate how IT can support core products or services. We theorize the role that SSF plays in an environment where individuals who visit B2C websites are not only customers but also technology users. Given the unique online environment that amalgamates vendor services with information systems (IS), our model integrates theories from both services marketing and technology acceptance to help explain the behavior of these customers/users. In doing so, we investigate the role of the extensively researched concept of service quality in relation to SSF. Although service quality provides guidance for how supporting services should be provided (e.g., responsively and reliably), it does not address what those services are (e.g., product recommendations). SSF addresses this deficiency, thus providing both theoretical and practical benefits through a focus on IT design and deployment. The results of a field study support that SSF is an important predictor of customer beliefs and behavior, beyond that predicted by service quality alone. SSF is an important concept to consider\u2014theoretically and practically\u2014in IT-mediated B2C service.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0163","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['service quality', 'customer', 'technology']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of online services and customer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

In this study, we define the amount of formal control as the variety of mechanisms used by a client to exercise control over a vendor and the extent to which the mechanisms are used. We use literature on transaction cost economics and organizational control to build a model of the antecedents of the amount of formal control. The study uses data from 138 client-vendor matched pairs working in eight large, long-term, ongoing outsourcing arrangements to test specific hypotheses. The results suggest that clients who have technical or relationship management knowledge, or have high levels of trust in their vendors, use formal control mechanisms to a lesser extent. On the other hand, task uncertainty was found to be positively associated with the amount of formal control, and the degree of core competency involved in the outsourced activity was not found to be related to the amount of formal control. These results are discussed, and implications for research and practice are drawn.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0169","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['control', 'vendor', 'outsourcing']","The article focuses primarily on the mechanisms of control in IT outsourcing relationships without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Most researchers have assumed that these displays improve the coordination of communication regardless of the relationship between the communicating parties. This article examines the conditions under which awareness displays improve coordination and the types of designs that most effectively support communication timing without overwhelming people with irrelevant information. Results from a pair of laboratory experiments indicate that awareness displays containing information about a remote collaborator's workload lead to communication attempts that are less disruptive, but only when the interrupter has incentives to be concerned about the collaborator's welfare. High-information awareness displays harmed interrupters' task performance, while abstract displays did not. We conclude that a display with an abstract representation of a collaborator's workload is optimal; it leads to better timing of interruptions without overwhelming the person viewing the display.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0175","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['communication', \"collaborator's welfare\", 'coordination']","The article discusses the impact of awareness displays on communication and collaboration, touching on the welfare of collaborators.

Conventional wisdom holds that the viral marketing process is both random and unmanageable. In this paper, we deconstruct the process and investigate the formation of the activated digital network as distinct from the underlying social network. We then consider the impact of the social structure of digital networks (random, scale free, and small world) and of the transmission behavior of individuals on campaign performance. Specifically, we identify alternative social network models to understand the mediating effects of the social structures of these models on viral marketing campaigns. Next, we analyse an actual viral marketing campaign and use the empirical data to develop and validate a computer simulation model for viral marketing. Finally, we conduct a number of simulation experiments to predict the spread of a viral message within different types of social network structures under different assumptions and scenarios. Our findings confirm that the social structure of digital networks play a critical role in the spread of a viral message. Managers seeking to optimize campaign performance should give consideration to these findings before designing and implementing viral marketing campaigns. We also demonstrate how a simulation model is used to quantify the impact of campaign management inputs and how these learnings can support managerial decision making.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0152","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['social structure', 'viral marketing', 'communication']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of viral marketing and the impact of social network structures on campaign performance, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes\u2014efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0158","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['user-system interactions', 'organizational outcomes', 'social network']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of user-system interactions and organizational performance, with limited emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

All three dimensions of their social capital (structural, relational, and cognitive) were measured prior to the team performing two tasks in a controlled setting, one face-to-face and the other through a lean digital network. Structural and cognitive capital were more important to knowledge integration when teams communicated through lean digital networks than when they communicated face-to-face; relational capital directly impacted knowledge integration equally, regardless of the communication media used by the team. Knowledge integration, in turn, impacted team decision quality, suggesting that social capital influences team performance in part by increasing a team's ability to integrate knowledge. These results suggest that team history may be necessary but not sufficient for teams to overcome the problems with the use of lean digital networks as a communication environment. However, team history may present a window of opportunity for social capital to develop, which in turn allows teams to perform just as well as in either communication environment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0177","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['social capital', 'knowledge integration', 'team performance']","The article discusses social capital and its impact on team performance, which touches on collaborative and relational aspects of work.

In Internet auctions, an important design option for sellers is the setting of a secret reserve price that has to be met by a buyer's bid for a successful purchase. Bidders have strong incentives to learn more about the secret reserve price in these auctions, thereby relying on their own network of friends or digital networks of users with similar interests and information needs. Information-sharing and flow in digital networks, both person-to-person and via communities, can change bidding behavior and thus can have important implications for buyers and sellers in secret reserve price auctions. This paper uses a multiparadigm approach to analyze the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in secret reserve price auctions. We first develop an analytical model for the effect of shared information on individual bidding behavior in a secret reserve price auction with a single buyer facing a single seller similar to eBay's Best Offer and some variants of NYOP. Next, we combine the implications from our analytical model with relational data that describe the individual's position in social networks. We empirically test the implications of our analytical model in a laboratory experiment, and examine the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in a field study with real purchases where we use a virtual world as proxy for the real world.

As these structures are significant for organizations, much research has been devoted to understanding network dynamics in ongoing processes of electronic communication. A valuable method for this objective is Social Network Analysis. However, its current focus on quantifying and interpreting aggregated static relationship structures suffers from some limitations for the domain of analyzing online communication with high volatility and massive exchange of timed messages. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method for event-based dynamic network visualization and analysis together with its exploratory social network intelligence software Commetrix. Based on longitudinal data of corporate email communication, the paper demonstrates how exploration of animated graphs combined with measuring temporal network changes identifies measurement artifacts of static network analysis, describes community formation processes and network lifecycles, bridges actor level with network level analysis by analyzing the structural impact of actor activities, and measures how network structures react to external events. The methods and findings improve our understanding of dynamic phenomena in online communication and motivate novel metrics that complement Social Network Analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0191","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of digital communication and network analysis without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using research on information processing as a foundation, we suggest that in the context of an online community, reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information is used by consumers to supplement or replace product information when making purchase decisions and evaluating the helpfulness of online reviews. Using a unique data set based on both chronologically compiled ratings as well as reviewer characteristics for a given set of products and geographical location-based purchasing behavior from Amazon, we provide evidence that community norms are an antecedent to reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information. Online community members rate reviews containing identity-descriptive information more positively, and the prevalence of reviewer disclosure of identity information is associated with increases in subsequent online product sales. In addition, we show that shared geographical location increases the relationship between disclosure and product sales, thus highlighting the important role of geography in electronic commerce. Taken together, our results suggest that identity-relevant information about reviewers shapes community members' judgment of products and reviews. Implications for research on the relationship between online word-of-mouth (WOM) and sales, peer recognition and reputation systems, and conformity to online community norms are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0193","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['identity', 'community norms', 'disclosure']","The article discusses the role of reviewer identity disclosure and community norms in online reviews, touching on themes of identity and social interaction.

Many virtual teams are geographically and culturally dispersed in order to facilitate around-the-clock work and to allow the most qualified individuals to be assigned to a project team. As such dispersion increases, virtual teams tend to experience greater and more diverse conflict compared to co-located teams. Since the dynamics of virtual team leadership are not yet well understood, research that examines how team leaders alleviate threats to team cohesion and provide strategies for conflict resolution makes significant contributions to the literature. Our study uses a survey-based methodology to examine the perceptions of 159 virtual team members employed by a large U.S. telecommunications corporation and five Korean firms involved in construction, finance, business consulting, sales, and distribution. The study integrates the dynamic model of conflict in distributed teams with the behavioral complexity in leadership theory to investigate the roles that virtual team leaders must effectively employ to reduce various forms of virtual team conflict. Our findings indicate that communication technologies are effective in reducing task conflict; however, the team leader may also mitigate task conflict by assuming the role of monitor. Likewise, process conflict may be abated in the virtual team as the leader performs coordinator activities. An effective virtual team leader exhibits specific roles to manage different types of conflict and the leader's response to conflict plays an important part in virtual team success.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1070.0149","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['conflict', 'leadership', 'diverse']","The article discusses conflict and leadership within virtual teams, highlighting the importance of managing diverse conflicts in geographically and culturally dispersed teams.

This occurs if early buyers hold different preferences than do later consumers about the quality of a given product. Readers of early product reviews may not successfully correct for these preference differences when interpreting ratings and making purchases. In this study, we develop a model that examines how idiosyncratic preferences of early buyers can affect long-term consumer purchase behavior as well as the social welfare created by review systems. Our model provides an explanation for the structure of product ratings over time, which we empirically test using online book reviews posted on Amazon.com. Our analysis suggests that firms could benefit from altering their marketing strategies such as pricing, advertising, or product design to encourage consumers likely to yield positive reports to self-select into the market early and generate positive word-of-mouth for new products.

Drawing from the Transaction-Based Model of stress and prior research on the effects of ICTs on end users, we first conceptually build a nomological net for technostress to understand the influence of technostress on three variables relating to end users of ICTs: job satisfaction, and organizational and continuance commitment. Because there are no prior instruments to measure constructs related to technostress, we develop and empirically validate two second order constructs: technostress creators (i.e., factors that create stress from the use of ICTs) and technostress inhibitors (i.e., organizational mechanisms that reduce stress from the use of ICTs). We test our conceptual model using data from the responses of 608 end users of ICTs from multiple organizations to a survey questionnaire. Our results, based on structural equation modeling (SEM), show that technostress creators decrease job satisfaction, leading to decreased organizational and continuance commitment, while Technostress inhibitors increase job satisfaction and organizational and continuance commitment. We also find that age, gender, education, and computer confidence influence technostress.

Using an ongoing novel field experiment that involves real bidders participating in real auctions, and voting with real dollars, we collect and examine a unique data set to estimate consumer surplus in eBay auctions. The estimation procedure relies mainly on knowing the highest bid, which is not disclosed by eBay but is available to us from our experiment. At the outset we assume a private value second-price sealed-bid auction setting, as well as a lack of alternative buying options within or outside eBay. Our analysis, based on a sample of 4,514 eBay auctions, indicates that consumers extract a median surplus of at least $4 per eBay auction. This estimate is unbiased under the above assumptions; otherwise it is a lower bound. The surplus distribution is highly skewed given the diverse nature of the data. We find that eBay's auctions generated at least $7.05 billion in total consumer surplus in 2003 and could generate up to $7.68 billion if the private value sealed-bid assumption does not hold. We check for the validity of our assumptions and the robustness of our estimates using an additional data set from 2005 and a randomly sampled validation data set from eBay.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0173","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on quantifiable consumer surplus in online auctions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, community-based development often falls short of creating software \u201cproducts\u201d in the sense that consumers understand. Our research identifies an emerging business network archetype in the OSS sector, the open source service network (OSSN), which seeks to address the \u201cproductization\u201d challenge. To do so, OSSNs must overcome the problems associated with exchanging resources between firms. We demonstrate that OSSNs overcome exchange problems by primarily relying on social, rather than legal, mechanisms; similar to the OSS communities from which they emerged. This is made possible because OSSNs use IT infrastructures that provide high visibility for primary value-creating activities. The research utilizes a multimethod theory-building approach, deriving a model from extant research, refining the model through qualitative case study analysis, and further refining the model through quantitative analysis of survey data. The paper reveals the manifestation of social mechanisms in OSSNs and how these are used for coordinating and safeguarding exchanges between firms. Specifically, we illustrate the primary importance of a shared macroculture (goals and norms) and collective sanctions for punishing firms who violate these goals/norms. Furthermore, our research highlights the interplay between digital and social networks within OSSNs, demonstrating that the use of social mechanisms is inherently dependent upon the underlying IT infrastructure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0207","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['social mechanisms', 'community-based development', 'goals and norms', 'collective sanctions']","The article discusses community-based development and social mechanisms, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics within business exchanges.

Though R&D can increase equity value by increasing firm value, it can also increase equity value at the expense of bondholder wealth through an increase in firm risk because equity is analogous to a call option on the underlying firm value. Shi [2003] tests this hypothesis by examining the relation between a firm's R&D intensity and its bond ratings and risk premiums at issuance. His results show that the net effect of R&D is negative for bondholders. We reexamine Shi's [2003] findings and in so doing make three contributions to the literature. First, we find that Shi's [2003] results are sensitive to the method of measuring R&D intensity. When we use what we argue is a better measure of R&D intensity, we find that the net effect of R&D is positive for bondholders. Second, when we use tests that Shi [2003] recognizes are even better than the ones that he uses, we find even stronger evidence of the positive effect of R&D on bondholders. Third, we examine cross-sectional differences in the effect of R&D on debtholders. Consistent with our main finding, we document a negative relation between R&D increases and default risk. The default risk reduction is also more pronounced for firms with higher initial default scores (where the debtholders have more to gain from an R&D increase) and for firms with more bank debt (where the debtholders have greater covenant protection from the possible detriments associated with R&D increases).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00264.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the financial implications of R&D investments and their impact on equity and bondholder wealth, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, consistent with the complementary association between disclosure and earnings quality, we find that the disclosure effect on cost of capital is substantially reduced or disappears completely (depending on the cost of capital proxy) once we condition on earnings quality. Extensions probing alternative proxies show that our findings are robust to measures of earnings quality and cost of capital, but not to other measures of voluntary disclosure.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that conservatism as measured by the asymmetric timeliness of earnings declines with managerial ownership.

The CEO is assumed to possess private information about his ability, which the board needs in order to decide whether to replace him. If the board is more active in removing low quality CEOs, the incumbent is better able to use his information advantage to extract rents. Since the board cannot commit not to renegotiate the contract, a board that is fully independent from the CEO is more active than is efficient ex ante. For this reason, shareholders are better off if the board of directors lacks some independence. The model predicts that a trend toward greater board independence is associated with subsequent trends toward higher CEO turnover, more generous severance packages, and larger stock option grants.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00269.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of board independence and CEO turnover without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We hypothesize and document that when a borrower's accounting information possesses higher DCV, information asymmetry between the lead arranger and other syndicate participants is lower, allowing lead arrangers to hold a smaller proportion of new loan deals. Further, we document that the influence of DCV on the proportion of the loan retained is conditional on the lead arranger's reputation, the existence of a credit rating, and the lead arranger's previous relationships with the same borrower. Finally, we find that when loans include performance pricing provisions, the likelihood that the single performance measure used is an accounting ratio, rather than a credit rating, is increasing in DCV.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00273.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting information and loan syndicate structures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Additionally, I test for learning versus effort-allocation effects of promotion-based incentives. I find that promotion and demotion decisions for store managers of a major U.S.-based fast-food retailer (QSR) are sensitive to nonfinancial performance measures of service quality and employee retention after controlling for financial performance. The likelihood of demotion in this organization is also sensitive to nonfinancial performance on the dimension of service quality, while the probability of exit is primarily sensitive to financial performance measures rather than nonfinancial performance measures. I also find evidence that the behavior of lower-level managers is consistent with the incentives created by the weighting of nonfinancial performance measures in promotion decisions. Managers in locations where there is a higher ex ante probability of promotion and a higher potential reward upon promotion demonstrate significantly higher levels and rates of performance improvement in service quality. Finally, consistent with promotion-based incentives inducing both effort-allocation and learning effects, I find that performance-improvement rates for service quality: (1) are higher in prepromotion periods in markets where promotions occur, (2) decrease immediately after the occurrence of a promotion in the same market area, and (3) remain higher than in markets where promotions do not occur. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence on an alternative to the explicit weighting of nonfinancial metrics in compensation contracts as a mechanism for generating improvements in nonfinancial dimensions of performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00275.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['nonfinancial', 'service quality', 'employee retention']","The article discusses nonfinancial performance measures and their impact on promotion decisions, indicating a focus on employee-related metrics.

Thus, while participants rewarded for creativity-weighted output tend to restrict their production to high-creativity efforts, they are unable to translate this focus into a greater volume of high-creativity output.

Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995\u20132006, we develop an exchange choice model that captures firm-level, industry-level, exchange-level, and country-level listing incentives, and test whether these listing preferences changed following the enactment of SOX. After controlling for firm characteristics and other economic determinants of these firms' exchange choice, we find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the London Stock Exchange's (LSE) Main Market did not change following the enactment of SOX. In contrast, we find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the NASDAQ and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following the enactment of SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these marginal companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance.

We decompose the cash component into: (1) the change in the cash balance, (2) issuances/distributions to debt, and (3) issuances/distributions to equity. We find that the higher persistence of the cash component is entirely due to the subcomponent related to equity. The other subcomponents have persistence levels almost identical to accruals. We investigate whether investors understand the implications of the differential persistence of the three subcomponents. Our results suggest that investors correctly price debt and equity issuances/distributions but misprice the change in the cash balance in a similar manner to accruals. Our tests enable us to empirically distinguish the \u201caccrual\u201d and \u201cexternal financing\u201d anomalies with results implying that the accrual anomaly subsumes the external financing anomaly.

Introducing a repeated, multiperiod, disclosure setting, we study the extent to which firms' strategic disclosure behavior in the past affects their prosperity to provide voluntary disclosures in the future. Our analysis demonstrates that by voluntarily disclosing private information firms make an implicit commitment to provide similar disclosures in the future, and therefore are less willing to voluntarily disclose information in the first place. This effect is expected to be of larger magnitude for firms (1) with a long history of absence of voluntary disclosures and an impressive past operating performance, or (2) that operate in a relatively stable and predictable business and information environment, or (3) whose managers have a long time horizon and a high degree of risk aversion.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00284.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate voluntary disclosures within a technical and strategic framework, lacking any references to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In such a setting, analysts allowed to participate during earnings conference calls by asking questions receive public signals that can facilitate the generation of new and valuable private information for the asking analyst. Realizing these public signals are valuable for the asking analyst, managers can use their discretion to discriminate among analysts by granting more participation to more favorable analysts. I use post\u2013Regulation Fair Disclosure conference call transcripts to document that the probability of an analyst asking a question during an earnings conference call is increasing in the favorableness of the analyst's outstanding stock recommendation. I also find that downgrades are associated with decreases in access to management during the conference call relative to other recommendation change activity. Analyst prestige moderates these effects. Favorable and prestigious analysts have higher participation probabilities than favorable and unprestigious analysts. Further, downgrades result in participation decreases only for unprestigious analysts. These findings are consistent with practitioner and regulatory concerns that managers discriminate among analysts by allowing more management access to more favorable analysts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00285.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","4","['discrimination', 'analysts', 'access', 'favorable']","The article discusses discrimination among analysts based on their favorability, which touches on ethical concerns related to access and equity in financial reporting.

The informational advantage such select participants gain is unclear. If multiple \u201cinsiders\u201d receive identical information, private information is immediately incorporated in price and each insider has zero expected profit. If, on the other hand, Regulation FD has curtailed the flow of information from firms, private information becomes longer-lived and more valuable. Hence, market makers will demand increased compensation by widening the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread. We identify the cost components of the bid-ask spread for a sample of NASDAQ stocks surrounding the implementation of Regulation FD. Controlling for other factors affecting the spread, we find that adverse selection costs increase approximately 36% after Regulation FD. We interpret our finding as Regulation FD failing to achieve one of its desired objectives.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00286.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial regulation and market behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Whereas the former is consistent with family owners having a longer investment horizon, better monitoring of management, and lower information asymmetry between owners and managers, the higher likelihood of earnings warnings is consistent with family owners having greater litigation and reputation cost concerns.

The agency cost hypothesis predicts that managers, when not monitored by shareholders, make self-maximizing decisions that may not necessarily be in the best interest of shareholders. These decisions include aggressively growing the firm, which reduces profitability and destroys firm value. Geographic earnings disclosures provide an interesting context to examine this issue. Beginning with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), most U.S. multinational firms are no longer required to disclose earnings by geographic area (e.g., net income in Mexico or net income in East Asia). Such nondisclosure potentially reduces the ability of shareholders to monitor managers' decisions related to foreign operations. Using a sample of U.S. multinationals with substantial foreign operations, we find that nondisclosing firms, relative to firms that continue to disclose geographic earnings, experience greater expansion of foreign sales, produce lower foreign profit margins, and have lower firm value in the post\u2013SFAS 131 period. Our conclusions are strengthened by the fact that these differences do not exist in the pre\u2013SFAS 131 period and do not relate to domestic operations. We find differences in the predicted direction only for foreign operations and only after adoption of SFAS 131. Our results are robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of control variables related to alternative corporate governance mechanisms, operating performance, and the firm's information environment. Overall, the results are consistent with the agency cost hypothesis and the important role of financial disclosures in monitoring managers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00289.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['agency cost', 'disclosure', 'shareholders']","The article primarily focuses on agency costs and financial disclosures without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Using standard market microstructure features we show that transaction costs constrain the informed trades that are necessary to incorporate earnings information into price. This implies weaker return responses at the time of the earnings announcement and higher subsequent returns drift for firms with higher transaction costs. Consistent with this prediction, we find that earnings response coefficients are lower for firms with higher transaction costs. Using portfolio analyses, we find that the profits of implementing the PEAD trading strategy are significantly reduced by transaction costs. In addition, we show, using a combination of portfolio and regression analyses, that firms with higher transaction costs are the ones that provide the higher abnormal returns for the PEAD strategy. Our results indicate that transaction costs can provide an explanation not only for the persistence but also for the existence of PEAD.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00290.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of transaction costs and their impact on market behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Under BRA, the auditor responds to the increasing complexity of auditee financial reports by acquiring a deep and comprehensive understanding of the auditee's industry, strategy, business models, and processes\u2014tasks best accomplished by higher-ranked labor\u2014and by employing this understanding to make audit labor allocations. Using proprietary data for 165 audits conducted in 2002, we investigate three propositions about audit labor use under BRA. First, relative to pre-BRA benchmarks for the same auditor, we expect BRA audits to use a greater proportion of higher-ranked labor. Second, we expect engagements with high assessed auditor business risk (ABR), a summary risk assessment that reflects the BRA auditor's rich understanding of the auditee, to be allocated more labor and more higher-ranked labor than pre-BRA benchmarks. Third, at all ranks of labor, we expect a positive association between assessed ABR and levels of labor use. We find empirical evidence consistent with these propositions. We also find that total labor use in our sample is only modestly lower than pre-BRA norms. Analysis of fee data from these engagements suggests that audit fees in 2002 are substantially less than would be expected under pre-BRA benchmarks. After controlling for audit labor use, both total fees and fees per hour increase with assessed ABR for first-year auditees but not for continuing auditees. Overall, our results provide evidence on the impact of the BRA audit regime and speak to the likely impact of BRA on audit effectiveness and efficiency.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00291.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit labor usage and fees without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that when only the leader is given a high-quality cost report, private cost information of higher quality is better incorporated into market prices (that are observable to participants). Both the leader and follower improve in profits and their prices better reflect the differences in overhead costs because the follower infers information from the leader's prices (information leakage). In contrast, when only the follower receives a high-quality cost report, the leader's profits and prices do not improve. This occurs because the follower conceals cost information when the leader has a low-quality cost report.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00292.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies in markets with different overhead costs, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Additional tests suggest that managers' discretionary choices that lead to smoother or more volatile earnings than cash flows garble information, on average.

In such markets, public information plays an additional commonality role, biasing stock prices away from the consensus fundamental value toward public information. Despite this bias, I demonstrate that provisions of public information always drive stock prices closer to the fundamental value. Hence, as a main source of public information, accounting disclosure enhances market efficiency, and transparency should not be compromised on grounds of the Keynesian-beauty-contest effect.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00295.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on market efficiency and accounting disclosure without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Bad news breaks are defined as breaks that are by growth firms, preceded by longer strings of consecutive earnings increases, followed by longer strings of consecutive earnings decreases, and associated with larger declines in earnings. Pre\u2013Reg FD transient institutions have abnormal selling of stocks in the quarter immediately preceding a bad news break. This abnormal selling is confined to firms that hold conference calls in the pre\u2013Reg FD period. However, in the post\u2013Reg FD period transient institutions do not exhibit similar abnormal selling of stocks in the quarter before a bad news break. Furthermore, after Reg FD transient institutions allocate less of their stock portfolios to conference call firms relative to non\u2013conference call firms in the quarters prior to a bad news break.

Positive information transfers are due to industry commonalities whereas negative information transfers are caused by competitive shifts. We argue that positive and negative intra-industry information transfers offset each other and lead to an overall finding of no information transfers even though they exist. We also conjecture that the type of information transfers from the same management forecast can be positive or negative based on the characteristics of the information receiver. We hypothesize positive information transfers to nonrival firms and negative information transfers to rivals. Consistent with our prediction, we find negative (positive) information transfers between forecasting firms and nonforecasting rival (nonrival) firms in the same industry. Through analyses using competitors identified by Hoover's and 10-K reports, we show more general evidence of negative information transfers to rival firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00297.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information transfers in management forecasts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2008","46","4","JOSEPH WEBER,\u00a0\n                     JOSEPH WEBER\n                     Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologySearch for more papers by this authorMICHAEL WILLENBORG,\u00a0\n                     MICHAEL WILLENBORG\n                     School of Business, University of ConnecticutSearch for more papers by this authorJIEYING ZHANG,\u00a0\n                     JIEYING ZHANG\n                     Leventhal School of Accounting, University of Southern California.

The Case of KPMG Germany and ComROAD AG","We study the stock and audit market effects associated with a widely publicized accounting scandal involving a public company (ComROAD AG) and a large, reputable audit firm (KPMG) in a country (Germany) that has long provided auditors with substantial protection from shareholder legal liability. We use this event to study whether an auditor's reputation helps to ensure audit quality, a rationale for which recent literature and events provide scant support. Given the absence of a strong insurance rationale for audit quality, Germany permits a relatively clean test of whether auditor reputation matters. We find that KPMG's clients sustain negative abnormal returns of 3% at events pertaining to ComROAD, and that these returns are more negative for companies that are likely to have higher demands for audit quality. We also find an increase in the number of clients that drop KPMG in the year of the ComROAD scandal (mostly smaller, recently public companies that are similar to ComROAD). Overall, our results provide support for the reputation rationale for audit quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00298.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of auditor reputation and its impact on audit quality without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The R2, which averages approximately 5% to 9%, measures the proportion of total information incorporated in share prices annually that is associated with earnings announcements. We conclude that the average quarterly announcement is associated with approximately 1% to 2% of total annual information, thus providing a modest but not overwhelming amount of incremental information to the market. The results are consistent with the view that the primary economic role of reported earnings is not to provide timely new information to the share market. By inference, that role lies elsewhere, for example, in settling debt and compensation contracts and in disciplining prior information, including more timely managerial disclosures of information originating in the firm's accounting system. The relative informativeness of earnings announcements is a concave function of size. Increased information during earnings-announcement windows in recent years is due only in part to increased concurrent releases of management forecasts. There is no evidence of abnormal information arrival in the weeks surrounding earnings announcements. Substantial information is released in management forecasts and in analyst forecast revisions prior (but not subsequent) to earnings announcements.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00299.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of earnings announcements and their impact on market information, with no mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or DEI.

By matching commercial paper investors with corporations seeking liquidity, ABCP sponsors facilitate a significant amount of short-term, securitized financing in the United States. FIN 46 and AcG-15 require sponsors to consolidate their ABCP conduits with their financial statements. We demonstrate that the volume of ABCP began to decline when FIN 46 was first proposed, and that this decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in North American banks' sponsorship of ABCP. We also demonstrate that North American banks entered into costly restructuring arrangements to avoid having to consolidate their conduits per the new accounting standards. Our results suggest that, in certain settings, accounting standards appear to have real effects on investment activity and product-market competition.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00300.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and investment decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I employ exploratory principal components analysis on 22 individual governance variables to obtain seven factors that represent the different dimensions of governance for a firm. I measure the level of agency conflicts in firms based on seven proxies for agency conflicts used in the literature. I find that firms with greater agency conflicts have better governance mechanisms in place, particularly those related to the board, audit committee, and auditor. I also find that the composition and functioning of the board, the independence of the auditor, and the equity-based compensation of directors are significantly associated with firm performance, but primarily for firms with high agency conflicts. Overall, the results support the theory that the existence and role of various governance mechanisms in a firm are a function of the level of agency conflicts in the firm.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00301.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['governance', 'agency conflicts', 'firm performance']","The article focuses primarily on corporate governance and agency conflicts without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

However, little subsequent research discusses the potential strategies that auditors may employ during the negotiation process. Our study extends the literature by investigating, in a post\u2013Sarbanes-Oxley environment, whether auditors will employ a reciprocity-based strategy for the resolution of audit differences and what client characteristics (client management's negotiating style and client retention risk) increase the extent to which it is utilized. Further, we explore the potential effect of a reciprocity-based strategy on the quality of the financial statements. Such a strategy involves bringing inconsequential items to management and subsequently waiving these items in an effort to encourage management to be more cooperative in the posting of significant income-decreasing adjustments. The results of experiment 1 indicate that client management's negotiating style and retention risk have an interactive effect on auditors' use of a reciprocity-based strategy. Specifically, auditors are more likely to utilize a reciprocity-based strategy when management's negotiating style is competitive and client retention risk is high. Experiment 2 findings suggest that the auditor's use of reciprocity during negotiation can actually result in more conservative financial statements by helping the auditor manage perceived client pressures to waive or reduce proposed adjustments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00302.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['negotiation', 'strategy', 'financial statements']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of auditing and negotiation tactics without significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

We show that, contrary to the standard textbook proposition, properties of management and financial accounting systems are not independent. Significantly, we provide an explicit connection between exogenous and observable properties of a firm's financial reporting system and the quality of the managerial accounting system on which manager(s) base real economic decisions. As the quality of those economic decisions can also be inferred from publicly available data, our theory generates new opportunities for empirical managerial accounting research on large nonproprietary samples. Further, by being able to identify enhanced performance due to improved managerial accounting information, our theory provides opportunities to gain a better understanding of the link between particular managerial accounting practices and the quality of the information produced.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00303.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial and financial reporting systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Proxying for sentiment using the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, we show that during low-sentiment periods, managers increase forecasts to \u201cwalk up\u201d current estimates of future earnings over long horizons. In contrast, during periods of high sentiment, managers reduce their long-horizon forecasting activity. Further, while there is an association between sentiment and the biases in analysts' estimates of future earnings, management disclosures vary with sentiment even after controlling for analyst pessimism, indicating that managers attempt to communicate with investors at large, and not just analysts. Our study provides evidence that firms' long-horizon disclosure choices reflect managers' desire to maintain optimistic earnings valuations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00305.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of corporate disclosure and investor sentiment without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We analyze the effects on market liquidity, cost of capital, and Tobin's q in 26 countries using a large sample of firms that are mandated to adopt IFRS. We find that, on average, market liquidity increases around the time of the introduction of IFRS. We also document a decrease in firms' cost of capital and an increase in equity valuations, but only if we account for the possibility that the effects occur prior to the official adoption date. Partitioning our sample, we find that the capital-market benefits occur only in countries where firms have incentives to be transparent and where legal enforcement is strong, underscoring the central importance of firms' reporting incentives and countries' enforcement regimes for the quality of financial reporting. Comparing mandatory and voluntary adopters, we find that the capital market effects are most pronounced for firms that voluntarily switch to IFRS, both in the year when they switch and again later, when IFRS become mandatory. While the former result is likely due to self-selection, the latter result cautions us to attribute the capital-market effects for mandatory adopters solely or even primarily to the IFRS mandate. Many adopting countries make concurrent efforts to improve enforcement and governance regimes, which likely play into our findings. Consistent with this interpretation, the estimated liquidity improvements are smaller in magnitude when we analyze them on a monthly basis, which is more likely to isolate IFRS reporting effects.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00306.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic consequences of IFRS reporting without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Audit partners are asked to predict which members of the audit team (managers or seniors) are able to detect specific types of errors. These predictions are then compared to errors detected by managers and seniors that are seeded in working papers. The results show that partners (1) exhibit significant overconfidence in the ability of subordinates to detect errors, (2) are more accurate in predicting managers' performance than seniors, (3) are more accurate at predicting subordinates' ability to detect mechanical (simple) errors than conceptual (complex) errors, and (4) are not better at predicting subordinates' ability to detect more frequent and more important errors than less frequent and less important errors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00307.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit effectiveness and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

It is shown that asymmetric reporting of good and bad news is value relevant as it affects the allocation of risk among future generations of shareholders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00309.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and investment risk without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2008","34","1","Klaus Wertenbroch\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Klaus Wertenbroch\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Dilip Soman\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Dilip Soman\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Amitava Chattopadhyay\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Amitava Chattopadhyay\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar","On the Perceived Value of Money: The Reference Dependence of Currency Numerosity EffectsGet access","Money illusion research shows that the nominal (face) value of money affects consumer perceptions of its real value. Recent mixed findings on consumer valuations in different currencies suggest that the underlying anchoring and adjustment processes are complex. We develop a framework to identify boundary conditions that specify the direction of anchoring effects on valuations in different currencies. Consumers anchor on the numerosity of the nominal difference between prices and salient referents (e.g., budgets) when evaluating transactions. Support for our framework comes from a series of experiments that evoke different reference standards. We discuss implications and opportunities for future research.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/34/1/1/1787177","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer perceptions and valuation of money without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The present studies show that people rely heavily on their relative self-assessments in product choice, but these estimates are often inaccurate and thus lead to unintended and inconsistent choices.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/34/1/104/1787182","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product choice without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The ad context, along with the ad content and individual differences in expertise, are found to influence the type of elaboration (item-specific and relational elaboration) a message receives. Message repetition affects evaluation when the additional exposures facilitate the complementary generation of these two types of elaboration of the ad message. When either type of elaboration dominates or when the message recipient spontaneously generates the impoverished type of elaboration, the effect of ad repetition is not observed.

Further, collectivists were more context driven in product ratings in a categorization task (study 3).

The findings rule out the cognition-based PF/M and suggest that the spontaneous affective reaction resulting from perceptual fluency is a crucial link between fluency and evaluation. The studies provide strong evidence that the spontaneous affect influences evaluative judgments through a more complex process, likely by coloring the interpretation of the fluency experience and the nature of resulting metacognitions relating fluency to liking.

Four studies show that people are more likely to underestimate the caloric content of main dishes and to choose higher-calorie side dishes, drinks, or desserts when fast-food restaurants claim to be healthy (e.g., Subway) compared to when they do not (e.g., McDonald's). We also find that the effect of these health halos can be eliminated by simply asking people to consider whether the opposite of such health claims may be true. These studies help explain why the success of fast-food restaurants serving lower-calorie foods has not led to the expected reduction in total calorie intake and in obesity rates.

This research proposes that negative group information induces asymmetric effects on individual attitudes toward a product, depending on anticipated group interaction as a moderating variable. More specifically, negative group information is expected to induce more attitude change on consumers who hold positive attitudes. However, an opposite pattern of results is predicted when consumers anticipate discussing their product attitude with a group. Namely, negative group information should stimulate more attitude change on consumers who hold negative attitudes. In two experiments, we show reliable support for this interaction between individual attitude valence, group attitude valence, and anticipated group interaction. We also provide evidence in support of the theoretically predicted mechanism responsible for these effects.

Schema Congruity as a Basis for Evaluating Anthropomorphized ProductsGet access","The present research proposes schema congruity as a theoretical basis for examining the effectiveness and consequences of product anthropomorphism. Results of two studies suggest that the ability of consumers to anthropomorphize a product and their consequent evaluation of that product depend on the extent to which that product is endowed with characteristics congruent with the proposed human schema. Furthermore, consumers' perception of the product as human mediates the influence of feature type on product evaluation. Results of a third study, however, show that the affective tag attached to the specific human schema moderates the evaluation but not the successful anthropomorphizing of the product.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/34/4/468/1820244","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of consumer product evaluation through anthropomorphism without engaging in any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

We posit that consumers rely on singular evaluative processing in pioneer contexts and comparative evaluation in follower contexts, producing unique moderating effects based on the existence of comparison brands.

A series of experiments provides evidence that drug marketing undermines intentions to engage in health-protective behaviors (i.e., a boomerang effect). The boomerang arises from two psychological mechanisms: (1) drugs reduce risk perceptions and perceived importance of, and motivation to engage in, complementary health-protective behaviors, and (2) drugs are associated with poor health that reduces self-efficacy and perceived ability to engage in complementary health-protective behaviors. A combined intervention accompanying a drug remedy that targets both motivation and ability mitigates the drug boomerang on a healthy lifestyle.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/34/5/713/1794592","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['healthy lifestyle', 'marketing', 'health-protective behaviors']","The article discusses the impact of drug marketing on consumer health behaviors, which touches on ethical implications of marketing practices and consumer well-being.

In a field experiment that assessed responses to actual ads shortly before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, we found that negative advertising produced more critical responses than positive advertising even for the voters' favored candidate. Yet, our findings suggest that the effects of negative advertising are multidimensional; four different effects\u2014reinforcement, backlash, defensive reactance, and position change\u2014were identified.

Thus, the firmness of a cup in which water is served may affect consumers' judgments of the water itself. This framework predicts that not all consumers are equally affected by such nondiagnostic haptic cues. Results from four studies show that consumers high in the autotelic need for touch (general liking for haptic input) are less affected by such nondiagnostic haptic cues compared to consumers low in the autotelic need for touch.

Relative to participants in the money condition, those in the time condition show a higher propensity to choose a compromise option (experiment 1) and to rely on an arbitrary anchor (experiment 2). We propose that such heuristics are used more for time because, compared to monetary expenditures, temporal expenditures are harder to account for. Consistent with this proposition, when participants in both time and money conditions are primed to account for their expenditures, they no longer differ in their use of heuristics.

We construct measures of information asymmetry based on market microstructure models, and find that they explain a significant portion of cross-sectional variation in B-share discounts, even after controlling for other factors. On a univariate basis, the price impact measure and the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread in the A- and B-share markets explains 44% and 46% of the variation in B-share discounts. On a multivariate basis, both measures are far more statistically significant than any of the control variables.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01313.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information asymmetry and its impact on asset prices, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

To mitigate this well-known risk, the bank enters into a repeat game with a coalition of investors who do not lemon-dodge in exchange for on-average underpriced shares. We (i) derive and test a quantitative IPO pricing rule (showing that tech IPOs were not excessively underpriced during the boom of the 1990s); and (ii) analyzing a unique multibank data set, find strong support for the conjecture that a bank preferentially allocates shares to its coalition.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01321.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO pricing and share allocation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A Study of Defaults in France, Germany, and the U.K.","Using a sample of small firms that defaulted on their bank debt in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we find that large differences in creditors' rights across countries lead banks to adjust their lending and reorganization practices to mitigate costly aspects of bankruptcy law. In particular, French banks respond to a creditor-unfriendly code by requiring more collateral than lenders elsewhere, and by relying on collateral forms that minimize the statutory dilution of their claims in bankruptcy. Despite such adjustments, bank recovery rates in default remain sharply different across the three countries, reflecting very different levels of creditor protection.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01325.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bankruptcy law and creditor rights without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a real options framework, I show that shareholders' risk-shifting incentives can reverse the expected negative relation between volatility and investment. I test two hypotheses that are consistent with risk-shifting behavior: (i) volatility has a positive effect on distressed firms' investment; (ii) investments of distressed firms generate less value during times of high uncertainty. Empirical evidence using 40 years of data supports both hypotheses. I further evaluate the effect of various firm characteristics on risk shifting, and estimate the costs of the investment distortion.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01326.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial risk-shifting behavior in distressed firms without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Hence, the effects of its incorporation into stock prices depend on who is the agent controlling its flow. Like a durable goods monopolist, a monopolistic analyst selling information intertemporally competes against herself. This forces her to partially relinquish control over the information flow to traders. Conversely, an insider solves the intertemporal competition problem through vertical integration, thus exerting tighter control over the information flow. Comparing market patterns I show that a dynamic market where information is provided by an analyst is thicker and more informative than one where an insider trades.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01327.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information flow and trading dynamics without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or diversity themes.

In particular, 36% of the growth recorded by conglomerate segments in growth industries comes from acquisitions, versus 9% for single-segment firms. In growth industries, the effect of financial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms increase in productivity.

Further, this representation has more identifiable parameters than the \u201cmaximal\u201d model of Dai and Singleton (2000).

The downward earnings management increases with both the percentage of the company that managers repurchase and CEO ownership. Pre-repurchase abnormal accruals are also negatively associated with future performance, with the association driven mainly by those firms that report the largest income-decreasing abnormal accruals. The study suggests that one reason firms experience post-repurchase abnormal returns is that post-repurchase realized earnings growth exceeds expectations formed on the basis of pre-repurchase deflated earnings numbers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01336.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and firm performance without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

However, this long-term abnormal performance is driven by the post-earnings-announcement drift. After controlling for the earnings performance and the skewness of buy-and-hold abnormal returns, there is no compelling evidence of a post-dividend-reduction or post-dividend-omission price drift.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01337.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on financial performance metrics related to dividend announcements without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

If the firm's manager cares about the current stock price, she will favor the growth strategy when the market pays more attention to growth numbers. Conversely, it can be rational for the market to weight growth measures more heavily when it is known that the firm is following a growth strategy. This two-way feedback between firms' strategies and the market's pricing rule can lead to excess volatility in real variables, even absent any external shocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01351.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial strategies related to growth and profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As part of the nexus of contracts surrounding a firm, strategic alliances can be viewed as relational contracts that blur firm boundaries. This paper provides evidence that alliances are more frequent among companies sharing a common venture capitalist. The effect is concentrated in alliances in which contracting problems are more pronounced, consistent with venture capitalists utilizing informational and other advantages in providing resources to firms. Further, these alliances improve the probability of exit for venture-backed firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01354.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of venture capital and strategic alliances without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Changes in the relative strength of promoter and opponent industries thus result in changes in the political equilibrium level of financial development. We conduct an event study using a sample of 41 countries that liberalized trade during 1970 to 2000, and show that the strengthening of promoter relative to opponent industries resulting from liberalization is a good predictor of subsequent financial development. The benefits of developing the financial system are insufficient for financial development, and rents in particular hands appear to be necessary to achieve it.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01363.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['financial development', 'political equilibrium', 'trade liberalization']","The article primarily focuses on financial development and trade liberalization without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

This feature of leverage is largely unexplained by previously identified determinants, is robust to firm exit, and is present prior to the IPO, suggesting that variation in capital structures is primarily determined by factors that remain stable for long periods of time.

When we compare asset growth rates with the previously documented determinants of the cross-section of returns (i.e., book-to-market ratios, firm capitalization, lagged returns, accruals, and other growth measures), we find that a firm's annual asset growth rate emerges as an economically and statistically significant predictor of the cross-section of U.S. stock returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01370.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical financial metrics and does not address any socially progressive themes, ethical considerations, or issues related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2008","63","4","EUGENE F.

For example, better investor protection mitigates the taking of private benefits leading to excess risk-avoidance. Further, in better investor protection environments, stakeholders like creditors, labor groups, and the government are less effective in reducing corporate risk-taking for their self-interest. However, arguments can also be made for a negative relationship between investor protection and risk-taking. Using a cross-country panel and a U.S.-only sample, we find that corporate risk-taking and firm growth rates are positively related to the quality of investor protection.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01372.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['investor protection', 'stakeholders', 'corporate risk-taking']","The article discusses investor protection and its effects on corporate risk-taking, focusing primarily on financial metrics rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

The CIO allocates capital to the managers who, in turn, allocate these funds to the assets in their asset class. This two-step investment process causes several misalignments of objectives between the CIO and his managers and can lead to large utility costs for the CIO. We focus on (1) loss of diversification, (2) unobservable managerial appetite for risk, and (3) different investment horizons. We derive an optimal unconditional linear performance benchmark and show that this benchmark can be used to better align incentives within the firm. We find that the CIO's uncertainty about the managers' risk appetites increases both the costs of decentralized investment management and the value of an optimally designed benchmark.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01376.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investment management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this environment, by buying assets that others are buying, investors ensure high future cash flows for the firm and subsequent high returns for themselves. Hence, investors have an incentive to coordinate, which may generate self-fulfilling beliefs and multiple equilibria. Using insights from global games, we pin down investors' beliefs, analyze equilibrium prices, and show that strong feedback leads to higher excess volatility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01378.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and investor behavior without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The Role of Debt Covenants","We identify a specific channel (debt covenants) and the corresponding mechanism (transfer of control rights) through which financing frictions impact corporate investment. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that capital investment declines sharply following a financial covenant violation, when creditors use the threat of accelerating the loan to intervene in management. Further, the reduction in investment is concentrated in situations in which agency and information problems are relatively more severe, highlighting how the state-contingent allocation of control rights can help mitigate investment distortions arising from financing frictions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01391.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the impact of debt covenants on corporate investment, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2008","63","5","ENRICA DETRAGIACHE,\u00a0\n                     ENRICA DETRAGIACHESearch for more papers by this authorTHIERRY TRESSEL,\u00a0\n                     THIERRY TRESSELSearch for more papers by this authorPOONAM GUPTA,\u00a0\n                     POONAM GUPTA\n                     Detragiache and Tressel are at the IMF.

One of our main findings is that the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has reduced the net benefits of a U.S. listing and registration, particularly for smaller foreign firms with lower trading volume and stronger insider control.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01402.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of U.S. securities markets and the implications of regulatory frameworks for foreign firms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

ICMs provide ex post resource flexibility, but come with ex ante commitment costs. Alternatively, stand-alones possess commitment ability but lack flexibility. By creating flexibility, integration can sometimes deter a rival's entry, but commitment problems can also invite predatory capital raising. These forces drive different organizational equilibria depending on the integrator's relation to the product market. Hybrid organizational forms like strategic alliances can sometimes dominate integration by offering some of its benefits with fewer strategic costs.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01395.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of internal capital markets and firm boundaries without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock and, conditional on buying stock, they will buy less.

That is, ownership is positively and significantly correlated with most variables that are predicted to indicate greater value from directors' monitoring. For example, directors' ownership is more prevalent in actively managed funds and in funds with lower institutional ownership.

We examine the value of disclosure through the controversial SEC requirement, since overturned, which required major hedge funds to register as investment advisors and file Form ADV disclosures. Leverage and ownership structures suggest that lenders and equity investors were already aware of operational risk. However, operational risk does not mediate flow-performance relationships. Investors either lack this information or regard it as immaterial.

Although asset growth has little effect on the behavior of the typical fund, we find that large funds and small-cap funds diversify their portfolios in response to growth. Greater diversification, especially for small-cap funds, is associated with better performance. Fund family growth is related to the introduction of new funds that hold different stocks from their existing siblings. Funds with many siblings diversify less rapidly as they grow, suggesting that the fund family may influence a fund's portfolio strategy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01417.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of mutual fund behavior and performance without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we examine individual NYSE specialist portfolios and test whether liquidity provision is affected as specialists allocate their attention across stocks. Our results indicate that specialists allocate effort toward their most active stocks during periods of increased activity, resulting in less frequent price improvement and increased transaction costs for their remaining assigned stocks. Thus, the allocation of effort due to limited attention has a significant impact on liquidity provision in securities markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01420.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial markets and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2008","63","6","SOKU BYOUN,\u00a0\n                     SOKU BYOUNSoku Byoun is with Hankamer School of Business, Baylor University.

Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994\u20132002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so.

Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest, most profitable firms.

The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding.

We show that, despite this, they provide quite accurate predictions of the sensitivity of corporate bond returns to changes in the value of equity (hedge ratios). This is important since it suggests that the poor performance of structural models may have more to do with the influence of non-credit factors rather than their failure to capture the credit exposure of corporate debt. The main result of this paper is that even the simplest of the structural models [Merton, R., 1974. On the pricing of corporate debt: the risk structure of interest rates. Journal of Finance 29, 449\u2013470] produces hedge ratios that are not rejected in time-series tests. However, we find that the Merton model (with or without stochastic interest rates) does not capture the interest rate sensitivity of corporate debt, which is substantially lower than would be expected from conventional duration measures. The paper also shows that corporate bond prices are related to a number of market-wide factors such as the Fama-French SMB (small minus big) factor in a way that is not predicted by structural models.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X08001001","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit risk modeling and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices."],["2008","90","1","Author links open overlay panelHarrison Hong a, Jeffrey D.

Exploring industry heterogeneity in learning by exporting","In recent years the international trade literature has focused on the effects of exporting and its benefits in an open economy.

Although the macro-literature has long addressed economic convergence, there has been relatively little research examining the effect of exporting on ex post firm performance. Likewise, there has been little research that examines the differential learning-by-exporting effects across industries. In this paper we build upon the convergence literature to argue that engaging in exporting provides firms, especially firms in technologically lagging industries, the opportunity to benefit disproportionately from knowledge spillovers. Using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 1997, we investigate empirically how exporting differentially influences the innovative outcomes of firms in technologically leading vs lagging industries. We find evidence that firms in technologically lagging industries (in which Spain lags the global technology frontier) learn more from exporting than those firms in technologically leading industries (in which Spain is at, or near, the global technology frontier).

First, we find that firms entering the region have greater advertising intensity and sales growth than industry peers that did not enter the region, suggesting that market-seeking considerations motivate expansion. Second, we find that earlier entry is undertaken by firms with fewer industry competitors and higher sales growth, suggesting that the desire to secure market share ahead of competitors motivates entry timing. Finally, we investigate the choice of entry mode into the region, and find that firms from concentrated industries are more likely to enter the region with high-equity commitment, consistent with market-seeking motives.

Such instability can ultimately lead to their internalization by one of the partners. In this study, we consider factors that influence (1) whether IJVs evolve toward becoming a wholly owned subsidiary, and (2) which parent (foreign or local) gains ownership of the venture. We use a sample of Hungarian joint ventures, and find that only when there is both a power imbalance between the parents and high levels of conflict is the likelihood that the joint venture converts to a wholly owned subsidiary enhanced. The extent to which the joint venture has learned from the foreign parent indirectly determines which parent gains full ownership. Extensive knowledge transfer to a joint venture in a transitioning economy combined with high levels of conflict increases the likelihood of the foreign parent gaining full ownership. In contrast, when there is extensive knowledge transfer and low conflict between the parents, the local parent is more likely to internalize the venture.

The role of parent experience and subsidiary autonomy","Prior research has argued that multinational enterprises (MNEs) prefer to enter culturally distant countries through greenfields rather than through acquisitions, since acquisitions in such countries are costlier to manage. This argument contains two hidden assumptions: (1) the additional costs of acquisitions in culturally distant countries are the same for all MNEs; and (2) such acquisitions have no benefits over their greenfield counterparts. In this paper we relax these two assumptions by arguing that an MNE's preference for greenfields in culturally distant countries depends on its international and host-country experience, and on the level of autonomy it plans to grant the focal subsidiary. Analyzing 171 wholly owned greenfield investments and full acquisitions made by Dutch MNEs in 35 countries, we find that these MNEs prefer to enter culturally distant countries through greenfields, but that this preference is lower when they have little international experience, or plan to grant the focal subsidiary considerable autonomy in marketing.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400356","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","3","['culturally distant', 'autonomy', 'experience']","The article discusses the concept of cultural distance and subsidiary autonomy, which hints at considerations of diversity and the complexities of international business.

Regardless of the choice of greenfield investment vs acquisition, they can control full equity (i.e., wholly owned subsidiaries) or share ownership with local partners (i.e., joint ventures). Depending on the stake taken in the targets, therefore, international acquisitions can be classified into two major categories \u2013 full or partial \u2013 although this distinction is missing in most previous studies. In this paper, I propose that the motives for acquisitions (vs greenfield investments) are specific to whether entries are made through full or partial ownership, in that full acquisitions are driven mostly by capability procurements, whereas partial acquisitions are motivated by other strategic considerations. By splitting a sample of Japanese investments in the US into two sub-regimes, the study has found that the decision on joint ventures vs wholly owned subsidiaries dictates the determinants that shape the choice between greenfield and acquisitive entries. There is also evidence that Japanese investors self-select the decision on full or partial ownership to justify the strategy that they have chosen to enter the US.

The laws are designed to reduce the supply of bribes by foreign investors by increasing the costs of bribing abroad. Such increase in costs will make foreign investors more sensitive to corruption, and induce them to reduce their investments in corrupt countries. However, the paper argues that these laws need to be implemented and coordinated in multiple countries to become effective.

Results support the theory's contention that commitment (to future exchanges) is associated with export performance, and is itself driven by a reciprocal cycle of each partner's perception of the other's commitment, relationship-specific investments and dependence. This cycle of commitment is in turn influenced by each partner's trust in the other (from past exchanges), with different types of trust linked to different types of commitment.

We empirically examine the relationship between television viewing, core values (i.e., religiosity and materialism), and perceived well-being factors (e.g., perceived socioeconomic status and relative life satisfaction). Data collected from the Western developed nations (e.g., United States and New Zealand) and several culturally homogeneous regions, including New Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far and Southeast, support the prevalence of diverse consumptionscapes with multiple global consumer cultures, rather than a single global culture. Globalization and advances in technology have not created global norms and homogenized our identities, but behavioral patterns and regional identities that are surprisingly durable. Specifically, materialism was shown to influence perceived socioeconomic status both positively (for two regions) and negatively (for two regions), and relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe), while perceived socioeconomic status had a positive influence on relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe and Latin America). The quantity of television viewing was positively shown to influence materialism, directly in some cases, as well as through perceived realism in others, providing limited support for the cultivation theory effect. Finally, religiosity was shown to play a countervailing role in negatively influencing materialism only in Latin American and Middle Eastern countries, and a positive influence on relative life satisfaction only in Latin America.

At the same time, customers expect firms to increasingly customize their products and services to meet their demands. Firms still need to produce superior products, sell smarter, and understand the markets as a whole, but the ability of firms to orient themselves to interact successfully with their individual customers will differentiate them in the future. Advances in technology have resulted in increasing opportunities for interactions between firms and customers, between customers, and between firms. An interaction orientation reflects a firm's ability to interact with its individual customers and to take advantage of information obtained from them through successive interactions to achieve profitable customer relationships. First, the authors identify the components of interaction orientation: (1) customer concept, (2) interaction response capacity, (3) customer empowerment, and (4) customer value management. Second, they relate interaction orientation to both customer-level and aggregate-level performance measures. Third, they identify the antecedents of interaction orientation. Fourth, they examine the moderating effects of customer-initiated contacts and competitive intensity on the interaction orientation\u2013performance linkage. The results are based on a survey of top marketing managers. The commonly held view that customer-based relational performance is related to customer-based profit performance is not supported. However, both customer-based relational performance and customer-based profit performance affect aggregate business-level performance positively.

It proposes that the firm's upgrade decision is influenced by (1) decision-maker perceptions of the relationship with the supplier, (2) contract-level experiences, and (3) interactions between firm- and contract-level variables. The authors model the firm's decision as a binary logit model with random parameters for the contract-level variables and fixed parameters for the firm-level variables. They estimate the model with data describing more than 2000 service contracts and find that decision-maker satisfaction, service quality, and price have a significant effect on the decision to upgrade; price and satisfaction also moderate the effect of service quality on the decision. Simulations indicate that modest improvements in service quality for a focal contract can have a relatively large, positive effect on the likelihood that the firm will upgrade. The results suggest that suppliers need to manage their firm relationships at both the individual contract level and the overall firm level.

Although extant approaches have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors, such as reported satisfaction, marketing-mix activities, and so on, managers often face situations in which the only information available is the duration for which subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service churn and understand the contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting. Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1) duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects (e.g., seasonality). Then, they apply the framework to subscription databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service churn (and to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does not significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence also contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these results to understand how the expected value of a subscription differs across model specifications. They find considerable variation across model specifications, indicating that model misspecification can affect resource allocation decisions and other marketing efforts that are important to a firm.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.1.082","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['subscriber heterogeneity', 'service churn', 'retention']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of service retention and churn without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Depending on the nature of information available to consumers, a firm's longevity can act in one of two ways to reduce the consumers\u2019 perceived risk: (1) Longevity may act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality, or (2) availability of a longer track record of an older firm may allow consumers to make more precise prediction of the firm's future quality. The authors develop a set of hypotheses that relate these two effects to consumers\u2019 preferences and test them in a series of four experiments. They find that a firm's age can act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality. When consumers also have information about firms\u2019 intrinsic attributes, the effect of a firm's age as an extrinsic cue is diminished under conditions of high involvement. The experiments also show that consumers prefer firms with longer track records, especially when firms\u2019 performance/quality levels are subject to more variability.

Specifically, the authors examine whether control on new product development exercised through rigorous gate review criteria increases project inflexibility, which in turn leads to increased failure to learn. They also focus on whether the effect of project inflexibility is worsened when there is turbulence in the firm's technological and market environment. Furthermore, the authors study whether failure to learn can have an adverse effect on new product performance when the product is novel. Finally, they examine whether a certain relaxation in gate evaluation (gate conditionality) that has been suggested recently mitigates the adverse effect of rigorously enforced controls. The results, which are based on a survey of 120 projects that used the Stage-Gate process for new product development, show that repeated application of strictly enforced and objective evaluation criteria for improved control makes projects more inflexible. Gate conditionality does not mitigate the adverse effect of gate review criteria. Project inflexibility leads to learning failure, and this effect is worsened when the technological environment of the firm is turbulent.

Does the type of innovation make a difference? To answer these questions, the authors examine how breakthrough and incremental innovations affect three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic rents, and total firm risk. They argue that each of these metrics is of independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on economic rents or firm risk.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.2.114","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the financial metrics related to innovation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, they examine the circumstances under which retailers choose demand-based pricing versus past-price dependence for different brands and categories. Given scarce resources and costs of price adjustments, demand-based pricing is more likely when the customer-driven and firm-driven costs of adjusting pricing patterns are low or when the benefits of such adjustments are high. First, the customer-driven benefits of demand-based pricing are expected to be greater in categories with higher penetration and for brands with higher market share and higher demand sensitivity to price. Second, the firm-driven benefits are greater for categories with higher private-label share. Finally, the customer-driven costs are greater for expensive categories, whereas the firm-driven costs are greater for categories with many stockkeeping units. The empirical findings support the conceptual framework, implying that customer-driven and firm-driven benefits are the main stimulants in the retailer's choice of demand-based pricing. In contrast, customer-driven and firm-driven costs significantly hinder retailer implementation of demand-based pricing. These insights enable retailers to identify problem areas and opportunities to improve the allocation of scarce pricing resources. The results also contribute to the ongoing debate in economics and marketing on the rationality of observed past-price dependence. Whereas previous research points to the negative impact on gross margins of this practice, the authors find that retailers weigh the costs and benefits of demand-based pricing rather than adhere to past-pricing patterns.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.2.15","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast, unit cohesion strengthens the positive effect of frontline autonomy on revenue and customer satisfaction without augmenting its negative effect on unit efficiency.

This research investigates the role of two factors\u2014(1) the goal congruence between the added functionality and the base and (2) the nature of the base product (utilitarian versus hedonic)\u2014on the evaluation of such convergent products (CPs). The author proposes that the evaluation of CPs with a utilitarian versus hedonic base is subject to an asymmetric additivity effect. Specifically, whereas CPs with a utilitarian base gain more from adding an incongruent, hedonic functionality than a congruent, utilitarian one, CPs with a hedonic base gain less from an incongruent, utilitarian addition than a congruent, hedonic one. This asymmetry is because hedonic additions enhance the pleasure of using a utilitarian base, whereas utilitarian additions may dilute the existing hedonic image of a hedonic base. The moderating role of prior ownership of the base of a CP is also explored. The author proposes that the effects of goal congruence are stronger for owners than for nonowners, but only for CPs with a hedonic base, not for those with a utilitarian base. The author verifies the proposed effects in an experimental study conducted with a large-scale, representative sample of the target market population. Further research on other (moderating) factors affecting the evaluation of CPs is also suggested.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.2.46","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product functionality and consumer evaluation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Contagion can occur inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties. Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur. Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked manufacturer\u2013dealer\u2013customer supply chain triads and explain a large variance (R2 = .30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to influence strategically the behavior of channel partners and may be better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other organizations within their supply chain.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.2.63","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['interfirm behavior', 'influence strategies', 'environmental uncertainty']","The article discusses interfirm behaviors and influence strategies within supply chains, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Dyadic survey and longitudinal objective performance data from 114 international joint ventures indicate that trust at each level has unique effects but similarly influences the collaborating firms' resource investments or the coentity's use of those resources. Interorganizational and agency trust motivate resource investments in the coentity, particularly in the context of a differentiation strategy, whereas intraentity trust promotes coordination within the coentity, and interorganizational trust and a differentiation strategy magnify that effect. Intraentity trust can also undermine coentity responsiveness to environmental change, especially when joined by interorganizational trust between collaborating firms and formalized decision making within the coentity.

For one online content provider, this article examines (1) the sources of long-term revenue loss (through attracting fewer free subscribers) and (2) how the firm's marketing actions affect its revenue gains (through attracting paid subscribers). The authors quantify revenue loss from several sources, including the direct effects of charging for part of the online content and the reduced effectiveness of search-engine referrals and e-mails. The analysis suggests several managerial implications. Managers should focus their price promotions on stimulating new monthly subscriptions, rather than the current promotional focus on stimulating new yearly contracts. In contrast, e-mail and search-engine referrals appear to be effective at generating yearly subscriptions. Meanwhile, free-to-fee conversion e-mail blasts are a double-edged sword; they increase subscription revenue at the expense of advertising revenue. Finally, further analysis shows that the move was preceded by the buildup of momentum in new free subscriptions, which appears to be beneficial for the move's success.

The authors demonstrate how two seemingly innocuous but common decision inputs that mid- and entry-level managers use\u2014(1) advice from colleagues and (2) training\u2014could propagate this bias. The authors conduct an experiment in which one generation of participants plays a noncooperative game and then passes on advice on how to play the same game to the second generation. The authors find that the second generation is more likely to accept decisions that negatively impact the competitor's profits, even when those decisions result in lower payoffs. The results suggest that the advice of the first generation causes the second generation to be more sensitive to relative performance. In a second experiment, the authors show that training films that create negative feelings toward competitors can have adverse effects on managers\u2019 decisions. The training increases the willingness of managers to sacrifice own profits to reduce competitor profitability. These findings have important implications for managers in competitive markets. This research suggests that standard training materials that emphasize beating competitors should be carefully assessed for their unintentional but potentially damaging effects.

They introduce the dual concepts of market expansion and entry thresholds to develop new hypotheses about competitive response. Some of these hypotheses contradict prior literature. Using objective data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry between 1997 and 2001, they estimate a shared-frailty hazard model to explain the competitive response to radical product innovations.

Several empirical findings remain puzzling; for example, within the same market, some small retailers decide to discount deeply, whereas others forgo the price-sensitive switchers and price high. The authors present theoretical and empirical analyses that address these varied pricing strategies. A model of three asymmetric firms shows that under multiple switcher segments, in which different switchers compare prices at different retailers, firm-specific loyalty is not sufficient to explain the variety of pricing strategies. The authors demonstrate that a retailer's strategy to discount deeply or frequently is driven by the ratio of the size of switcher segments for which the retailer competes to its loyal segment size. The relative switcher-to-loyal ratios among retailers explain situations in which a small retailer finds it optimal to price high, despite having few loyals, or to discount and go for the switchers. The results of two empirical studies confirm the model's predictions for varied pricing strategies in the context of Internet booksellers. The analyses also present several implications. A small retailer can sometimes benefit from strategically limiting its access to switchers to soften price competition. A midsized retailer can benefit from targeting its switcher acquisition activities toward its larger rival, given the shallower discounts involved. When most switchers widely compare prices, a large retailer should offer few shallow discounts because other firms will more aggressively discount. The importance of switcher segmentation suggests that managers should carefully measure switching behavior in devising pricing strategies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/JMKG.72.3.124","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical studies of pricing strategies among retailers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level.

The authors argue that the new ventures that gain the most from innovation are those that adopt strategies that give them legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders. New ventures can gain legitimacy by creating associations with established entities; such associations can be internal or external to the firm. The authors test these ideas by examining the stock market gains of all products introduced between 1982 and 2002 by all public firms in the U.S. biotechnology industry. The results show that new ventures that acquire legitimacy externally by forming alliances with established firms gain more from their new products than new ventures that do not form such alliances. Among new ventures that do not form alliances, those that acquire legitimacy internally by creating a history of product launches or by hiring reputed executives or scientists gain more from their new products than those that do not. In relative terms, it pays more to have introduced a new drug before than to have a reputed executive on the firm's board; in turn, adding a reputed executive pays more than adding a reputed scientist to the firm's board. Finally, although new ventures can gain from either external or internal legitimacy, pursuit of external legitimacy by firms that already have internal legitimacy leads to lower rewards to innovation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.4.058","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['legitimacy', 'stakeholders', 'alliances']","The article focuses primarily on the strategies for gaining legitimacy in the context of innovation and market performance, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, most financial models do not include customer-related metrics in this process. Studies in marketing have found that one particular customer metric, customer satisfaction, improves the ability to predict future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and shareholder value. However, most of these studies predominantly employ models that are not directly used in finance practice. This article extends existing literature by examining the impact of customer satisfaction on firm valuation by employing multiples and risk-adjusted abnormal return models borrowed directly from the practice of finance. Data include 3600 firm-quarter observations from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, COMPUSTAT, and Center for Research in Securities Prices databases from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that a portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive changes in customer satisfaction will outperform the other three possible portfolio combinations (low levels and negative changes, low levels and positive changes, and high levels and negative changes in customer satisfaction) along with Standard & Poor's 500.

The proposed intrinsic market evolution test can identify intrinsic-evolving and intrinsic-stationary markets. The authors analyze five major budgeting implications and provide methods to quantify temporary and sustained budgeting. In general, in an intrinsic-evolving market, budgeting can be short-term focused, whereas in an intrinsic-stationary market, the focus should be on sustained budgeting.

In both the experiments, salespeople adopting the customer-focused sales campaign coordinated their sales calls with the objective of selling all the products that a customer was predicted to purchase only at the time the customer was expected to purchase. The authors compare this strategy with the current practice in the organization in which salespeople for each product category independently contacted the customers who were expected to purchase in that category without any guidance on the expected timing of customer purchase. The experiments show that adopting a customer-focused sales campaign can significantly increase firm profits and return on investment. The total incremental profits obtained from implementing the customer-focused sales campaign was more than $1 million. High-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the efficiency of marketing contacts, whereas low-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the effectiveness of the marketing contacts. A customer-focused sales campaign also improved the relationship quality between the customer and the firm. This research provides empirical evidence for theoretical expectations of the benefits provided by a customer-focused sales campaign.

This research considers whether the choice of language in advertising to bilinguals influences the types of thoughts they have in response to an advertisement. In other words, for a bilingual, can the exact same selling message cue different associations depending on the language in which it is presented? The underlying issue is whether advertisers can use language of execution as a strategic variable with which to generate certain types of associations that may facilitate persuasion. The authors consider this issue from a social cognition perspective. They hypothesize that a native-language advertisement is more likely to elicit self-referent thoughts about family, friends, home, or homeland, which in turn may lead to more positive attitude measures and behavioral intentions.

The authors address both issues and conduct a cross-industry study with 310 firms from business-to-consumer and business-to-business contexts together with two independent validation samples. The results show that customer prioritization ultimately leads to higher average customer profitability and a higher return on sales because it (1) affects relationships with top-tier customers positively but does not affect relationships with bottom-tier customers and (2) reduces marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the ability to assess customer profitability, the quality of customer information, selective organizational alignment, selective senior-level involvement, and selective elaboration of planning and control all positively moderate the link between a firm's prioritization strategy and actual customer prioritization.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.5.110","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['customer prioritization', 'relationships', 'profitability']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of customer prioritization and profitability without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Drawing on knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the new product development literature, helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms.

Empirical research using four data sources for a single artistic industry produces strong support for the moderation hypotheses. When competitive density is low, a customer retention strategy emphasizing close relationships with customers and adaptive learning enhances performance. When competitive density is high, a customer acquisition strategy emphasizing innovation and competitor learning enhances performance. Four key takeaways emerge. As competitive density increases, (1) the financial impact of choosing the right mix of resources and capabilities increases; (2) close customer relationships become liabilities, providing no revenue benefits and exerting a negative effect on net income; (3) close relationships with suppliers increase revenues but also expenses, so that net income decreases; and (4) adaptive learning lowers revenue and, even more so, expenses, so that net income increases.

The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them.

The authors estimate the model for two retail chains in the Netherlands\u2014the leading service chain with a well-differentiated high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough levels. The managerial implications of this research are important. Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general, not to the PL of any particular chain.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.6.019","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on econometric modeling of consumer behavior related to private-label products and store loyalty, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

However, the impact of brand community membership on actual new product adoption behavior has yet to be explored. This study examines the effects of brand community participation and membership duration on the adoption of new products from opposing brands as well as from the preferred brand. Longitudinal data were collected on the participation behavior, membership duration, and adoption behavior of 7506 members spanning four brand communities and two product categories. Using a hazard modeling approach, the authors find that higher levels of participation and longer-term membership in a brand community not only increase the likelihood of adopting a new product from the preferred brand but also decrease the likelihood of adopting new products from opposing brands. However, such oppositional loyalty is contingent on whether a competitor's new product is the first to market. Furthermore, in the case of overlapping memberships, higher levels of participation in a brand community may actually increase the likelihood of adopting products from rival brands. This finding is both surprising and disconcerting because marketing managers usually do not know which other memberships their brand community members possess.

Understanding how Consumers Allocate their Consumption\n                        Budget","All types of consumer expenditures ultimately vie for the same pool of limited resources\u2014the consumer's discretionary income. Consequently, consumers\u2019 spending in a particular industry can be better understood in relation to their expenditures in others. Although marketers may believe that they are operating in distinct and unrelated industries, it is important to understand how consumers, with a given budget, make trade-offs between meeting different consumption needs. For example, how much would escalating gas prices affect consumer spending on food and apparel? Which industries would gain most in terms of extra consumer spending as a result of a tax rebate? Answers to these questions are also important from a public policy standpoint because they provide insights into how consumer welfare would be affected as consumers reallocate their consumption budget in response to environmental changes. This study proposes a structural demand model to approximate the household budget allocation decision, in which consumers are assumed to allocate a given budget across a full spectrum of consumption categories to maximize an underlying utility function. The authors illustrate the model using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the United States, covering 31 consumption categories over 22 years. The calibrated model makes it possible to draw direct inferences about the trade-offs individual households make when they face budget constraints and how their relative preferences for different consumption categories vary across life stages and income levels. The study also demonstrates how the proposed model can be used in policy simulations to quantify the potential impacts on consumption patterns due to shifts in prices or discretionary income.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.72.6.109","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['consumer welfare', 'public policy', 'budget allocation']","The article discusses consumer spending and its implications for public policy, which hints at social considerations, but it primarily focuses on economic behavior and technical modeling without a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes."],["2008","72","6","Lisa C.

Second, the model integrates an advanced item response theory measurement model with a structural hierarchical model for studying antecedents of ERS. The authors simultaneously estimate a person's ERS score and individual- and group-level (country) drivers of ERS.

In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference.

A household can respond to price promotions by effectively cherry-picking through (1) spatial price search across stores and (2) temporal price search across time. However, extant research has analyzed these two dimensions of price search only separately and therefore underestimates both the consumer response to price promotions and the impact of promotions on retail profit. In this article, the authors introduce an integrated analysis of spatial and temporal price search. They seek answers to three questions: First, what are the predictors of household decisions to perform either spatial or temporal price search? Second, how effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with observed purchase data to address these questions.

In this article, the authors test two rival sociological perspectives regarding the influence of customer trust in the broader context. One perspective proposes that trust in the context replaces trust in individual firms and their representatives. This view suggests that firm/representative trust is not always critical, especially for customers with high trust in the context. An alternative perspective is that trust in the context fosters and legitimates trust in firms and their representatives. This view implies that firm/representative trust is a necessary mediator of the influence of trust in the context. The authors test predictions based on both perspectives, using empirical results from two studies implemented in two countries.

Using panel data for seven years from 100 brands across seven product categories, the authors employ a two-stage approach in which long-term promotional effectiveness is first estimated with persistence modeling and then these effectiveness estimates are related to brand equity and new product introductions. By examining a broad range of brands in each category, the authors find that positive sales evolution from promotional efforts is fairly common, especially for small brands.

It is postulated that an interdependent self-construal leads to a superior ability to uncover relationships among stimuli (e.g., an extension and its parent brand) and thus is likely to enhance the perceived fit of an extension and the likelihood of its acceptance. However, these beneficial effects are likely to emerge only under conditions in which the interdependent consumer is motivated to elaborate extensively on the extension information.

They develop three buyer-centric measures for the intensity level of each competing make from this information: (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to the buyer's location).

All three buyer-centric measures of intensity were significantly related to new car choice. Buyers were more likely to select cars whose dealer networks had shorter distances to the closest outlet (accessibility), more dealers within a given radius from the buyer (concentration), and locations that skewed toward the buyer (spread).

Contrary to previous literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant force for the increase in sales.

The authors investigate the short- and long-term effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains.

The authors find strong support for the conceptual model, which distinguishes between the seriousness of the threat to the incumbents and their capacity to withstand the threat. The authors validate their findings using three alternative measures of company performance: percentage growth in the incumbent retailer's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and return on assets between 1998 (the year before the Asda takeover) and 2002 (three years after the takeover). The authors discuss various managerial implications of their results. By acting proactively, incumbents can mitigate the negative performance consequences, while maximally benefiting from the positive implications of a giant competitor's entry.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.519","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic impact of Wal-Mart's entry into the UK market, emphasizing shareholder value and performance metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns."],["2008","45","5","Michael Lewis Michael.lewis@wustl.edu","Individual Team Incentives and Managing Competitive Balance in Sports Leagues: An\n                        Empirical Analysis of Major League Baseball","Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have long been concerned with competitive imbalances caused by differences in local revenues. The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from high-local-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million. Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically, the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.535","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['competitive balance', 'revenue sharing', 'market population']","The article focuses primarily on competitive balance and economic factors in sports leagues, with minimal emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

The results suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition.

Entry Strategy and the Role of Market Research","A firm planning market entry can attempt to develop a product that is either similar to the incumbent's existing offering (imitation) or entirely novel (innovation). The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation\u2013imitation decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.575","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market entry strategies and the impact of research and development on profitability, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The optimal construction of the split questionnaire design is easy and fast. The authors use Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures to impute missing values that result from the design.

They compare the efficiency of split questionnaires generated with the proposed method with multiple matrix sampling designs, incomplete block designs, and a heuristic procedure, using synthetic and empirical Web survey data.

Partitions draw attention to the consumption decision by introducing a small transaction cost; that is, they provide more decision-making opportunities so that prudent consumers can control consumption. Thus, people are better able to constrain consumption when resources associated with a desirable activity (which they are trying to control) are partitioned rather than when they are aggregated. This effect of partitioning is demonstrated for the consumption of chocolates (Study 1) and gambles (Study 2). In Study 3, process measures reveal that partitioning increases recall accuracy and decision times. Importantly, the effect of partitioning diminishes when consumers are not trying to regulate consumption (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, Study 4 explores how habituation may decrease the amount of attention that partitions draw to consumption. In this context, partitions control consumption to a greater extent when the nature of partitions changes frequently.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.665","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of consumption control through partitioning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping mall and during Thanksgiving.

The former is caused by consumer heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms\u2019 decisions. In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity, and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and without instrumenting for the explanatory variables. The authors show theoretically that in their estimation method, unobserved heterogeneity does not affect the consistency of the parameter estimates, but if it is not accounted for, endogeneity may bias the results.

In this study, we consider a variation of PTSP that involves a short shelf life product; hence, there is no inventory of the product in process. Once a lot of the product is produced, it must be transported with nonnegligible transportation time directly to various customer sites within its limited lifespan. The objective is to determine the minimum time required to complete producing and delivering the product to meet the demand of a given set of customers over a wide geographic region. This problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. We analyze the properties of this problem, develop lower bounds on the optimal solution, and propose a two-phase heuristic based on the analysis. The first phase uses either a genetic or a memetic algorithm to select a locally optimal permutation of the given set of customers; the second phase partitions the customer sequence and then uses the Gilmore-Gomory algorithm to order the subsequences of customers to form the integrated schedule.

As the number of prespecified decision-outcome classes increases, however, the trees so generated often become overly complex with regard to the number of leaves and nodes, and the classification accuracy consequently drops. In contrast, the multi-decision-tree induction (MDTI) approach, which constructs different decision trees for different decision-outcome classes, may reduce rule cardinality, and improve both rule conciseness and classification accuracy over a traditional single-decision tree inducer. This paper analytically and empirically compares the two techniques based on these measures. The analysis and results show that, in some situations, MDTI outperforms the traditional approach in terms of cardinality, conciseness, and classification accuracy of the acquired knowledge structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0215","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-tree induction without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2008","20","1","Oscar Cord\u00f3nOscar Cord\u00f3nocordon@decsai.ugr.esDepartamento de Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f3n e Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain, and European Centre for Soft Computing, Edificio Cient\u00edfico-Tecnol\u00f3gico, 33600 Mieres (Asturias), SpainSearch for more papers by this author, Sergio DamasSergio Damassdamas@ugr.esDepartamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Inform\u00e1ticos, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain, and European Centre for Soft Computing, Edificio Cient\u00edfico-Tecnol\u00f3gico, 33600 Mieres (Asturias), SpainSearch for more papers by this author, Jose Santamar\u00edaJose Santamar\u00edajose.santamarialopez@uca.esDepartamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Inform\u00e1ticos, Universidad de C\u00e1diz, Chile 1, 11002 C\u00e1diz, SpainSearch for more papers by this author, Rafael Mart\u00edRafael Mart\u00edrafael.marti@uv.esDepartamento de Estad\u00edstica e I.O., Universidad de Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Valencia, SpainSearch for more papers by this author","Scatter Search for the Point-Matching Problem in 3D Image Registration","Scatter search is a population-based method that has recently been shown to yield promising outcomes for solving combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problems. Based on formulations originally proposed in the 1960s for combining decision rules and problem constraints, such as the surrogate constraint method, scatter search uses strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective in a variety of problem settings. We present a scatter-search implementation designed to find high-quality solutions for the 3D image-registration problem, which has many practical applications. This problem arises in computer vision applications when finding a correspondence or transformation between two computer images obtained under different conditions. Our implementation goes beyond a simple exercise on applying scatter search, by incorporating innovative mechanisms to combine and improve solutions and to create a balance between intensification and diversification in the reference set. Furthermore, heuristic information taken from a preprocessing of the images is incorporated into the algorithm to improve its performance. Our computational experimentation tackling two different medical registration applications establishes the effectiveness of scatter search in relation to different approaches usually applied to solving the problem. We have considered both simulated magnetic resonance images and real-world computerized tomography images as data sets. To measure the robustness of our proposal, the image data sets are intentionally selected for addressing registration environments with the presence of noise, anatomical lesions, and occlusions between images.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0216","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization method in image registration without any references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Much of this work has considered deteriorating inventory control with many models having been proposed for various situations. However, no researchers have specifically studied fresh produce, which has its own special characteristics. Most research categorizes fresh produce into more general deteriorating categories with random lifetimes and nondecaying utilities. However, this classification is not reasonable or practical because the freshness of an item usually plays an important role in influencing the demand for the produce. In this paper, a single-period inventory and shelf-space allocation model is proposed for fresh produce. These items usually have a very short lifetime. The demand rate is assumed to be deterministic and dependent on both the displayed inventory (the number of facings of items on the shelves) and the items' freshness condition (which decreases over time).

It is now widely deployed by organizations and provides seamless temporary processing-capacity expansion to handle peak-period demand on e-commerce servers, distributed gaming, and content storage and distribution. We develop a market-based resource-allocation model that adds an economic layer to the current approach of treating resource allocation as primarily a scheduling issue. We design a value-elicitation and allocation scheme that provides the economic incentives for buyers and sellers of computing resources to exchange assets. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial call auction and present a portfolio of three solution approaches that trade off economic properties, such as allocative efficiency, incentive compatibility, and fairness in allocation, with computational efficiency. The first of these is an efficient solution that maximizes social welfare and yields incentive-compatible Vickrey-Clarke-Groves prices, but requires solving multiple instances of an NP-hard problem. For markets where having a commodity price is critical, we show how the addition of fairness constraints to the efficient model can somewhat reduce the computational burden and yet preserve incentive compatibility. Finally, for markets that require real-time fast solution techniques, we propose a time-sensitive fair Grid (tsfGRID) heuristic that relaxes the maximal allocation requirement of the welfare-maximizing fair solution. Its solution is not guaranteed to be incentive-compatible, but the heuristic is designed to be fast, maintain fairness in allocations, and yield commodity prices. Notably, while incentive compatibility is not guaranteed by tsfGRID, computational results comparing it with the efficient solution technique indicate that there are no significant differences in the expected-revenue and operational-allocative characteristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0221","","JOC","Information Systems","3","['fairness', 'social welfare', 'incentive compatibility']","The article discusses fairness in allocation and social welfare, which are relevant to ethical considerations in economic models.

Thus, even when the IDS is good, an intrusion signal may not imply that the user is more likely to be a hacker than a normal user. Ignoring the low base rate for the proportion of hackers results in acting on every intrusion signal, which is costly because of the high rate of false alarms. This problem is known as the base-rate fallacy in IDSs. On the other hand, ignoring intrusion signals renders IDSs useless. We propose and analyze waiting-time policies, which specify a response to signals from IDSs. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic programming model and derive the optimal waiting time before acting upon an intrusion signal. Because the optimal policy is difficult to implement in many situations, we also derive and theoretically analyze a myopic policy. Our simulations suggest that the behavior of the myopic policy is qualitatively similar to that of the optimal policy. Further, the myopic policy performs better than other policies often used in practice, such as the Bayes policy and m-strike policies. The myopic policy can be implemented easily in a decision support system that supplements an IDS to mitigate the base-rate fallacy and to improve the value of the IDS.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0222","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of intrusion-detection systems and their effectiveness, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although this problem is often met in real-life scenarios of transportation logistics, it has not received much attention by researchers. Our proposed framework employs a combination of algorithmic blocks based on powerful metaheuristic methodologies designed to achieve a desirable intensification and diversification interplay. In the first step of the solution approach, the initial solution is obtained by a cost-saving construction heuristic. In the second step, the initial solution is improved by employing tabu search within the variable neighborhood search methodology. Finally, guided local search is applied in the third step, to eliminate low-quality features from the final solution produced. The proposed algorithmic framework was successfully applied to benchmark instances in the literature, generating several new best solutions.

SANs and the related concept of stochastic process algebra are advantageous because they keep the transition matrix in a compact form called the SAN descriptor. Several iterative and projection methods have been tested for SANs. Some preconditioners for SANs have been developed to speed up the convergence. Recently, Langville and Stewart [Langville, A., W.

In TSP, we take into account as much as possible the effect of synchronization using term grouping, factorizations, and approximation techniques. We conducted an experimental study to compare our TSP with the NKP preconditioner, and the results show that TSP outperformed NKP on both the number of iterations and the execution time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0236","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic automata networks and performance modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We present a faster decoupled computation method, which in a first stage computes the continuation index and then, in a second stage, computes the switching index an order of magnitude faster in at most n2 + O(n) arithmetic operations, achieving overall a fourfold reduction in arithmetic operations and substantially reduced memory operations. The analysis exploits the fact that the Asawa and Teneketzis index is the marginal productivity index of the project in its restless reformulation, using methods introduced by the author. Extensive computational experiments are reported, which demonstrate the dramatic runtime speedups achieved by the new algorithm, as well as the near optimality of the resultant index policy and its substantial gains against the benchmark Gittins index policy across a wide range of randomly generated two- and three-project instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0238","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution to a computational problem without any mention of social themes, diversity, ethics, or social justice.

The work is focused on strong modeling capabilities as well as efficient solution procedures to be used in all kinds of metaheuristics. From the modeling point of view, the framework covers a variety of standard VRP types with classical constraints such as capacity, distance, route length, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints, but also nonstandard \u201crich\u201d VRPs. From the methodological point of view, local search (LS) is the key solver engine to be used in heuristic solution procedures. First and foremost, the framework introduces two generic techniques for the efficient exploration of edge- and node-exchange neighborhoods. New preprocessing methods allow \ud835\udcaa(nk) neighborhoods to be searched in time complexity \ud835\udcaa(nk), i.e., without an additional effort for feasibility testing in the worst case.

While intrusion prevention provides immediate/real-time protection, it suffers from two deficiencies, which are the sensitivity and specificity trade-off and the accuracy and efficiency trade-off. To address these issues, we introduce two models of intrusion prevention. The first model is for a hybrid system playing both detection and protection roles.

However, when k is large (e.g., for a generator such as the popular Mersenne twister, for which k = 19,937), this matrix-vector multiplication is slow, and a large amount of memory is required to store the k \u00d7 k matrix.

Stations in close proximity are not allowed to use the same frequency, as their signals would interfere with each other. In this context, an important design problem is that of scheduling access to the high-speed communications channel in such a way as to maximize the utilization while avoiding interference and keeping the frame length to a minimum. This is frequently referred to as the broadcast scheduling problem and is known to be NP-hard. It is often formulated as a nonlinear discrete optimization problem for a given frame length and solved via heuristic approaches by parametrically varying the length of the frame. Despite this, the sizes of the problems solved have been small, with the solution times becoming prohibitive with increasing problem size.

A total of 23 different algorithms including both flowshop-specific methods as well as general multiobjective optimization approaches have been tested under three different two-criteria combinations with a comprehensive benchmark. All methods have been studied under recent state-of-the-art quality measures. Parametric and nonparametric statistical testing is profusely employed to support the observed performance of the compared methods. As a result, we have identified the best-performing methods from the literature, which along with the review, constitutes a reference work for further research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0258","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of multiobjective algorithms in scheduling without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The focus of this paper is the situation in which the collection of properties are not \u201cgiven,\u201d but data are available from which a time-series input model is to be estimated. The input model we consider is the very flexible autoregressive-to-anything (ARTA) model of Cario and Nelson [Cario, M. C., B. L. Nelson. 1996. Autoregressive to anything: Time-series input processes for simulation. Oper. Res. Lett.19 51\u201358]. Recently, we developed a statistically valid algorithm (ARTAFIT) for fitting this model to stationary univariate time-series data using marginal distributions from the Johnson translation system. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study to assess the performance of our algorithm relative to the two most commonly used approaches: (a) fitting the marginal distribution but ignoring the autocorrelation structure, and (b) fitting separately the marginal distribution as in (a) and the autocorrelation structure using the sample autocorrelation function. We find that ARTAFIT, which fits the marginal distribution and the autocorrelation structure jointly, outperforms both (a) and (b), and we demonstrate the importance of taking dependencies into account while developing input models for stochastic simulation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1070.0261","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for fitting time-series models in stochastic simulations without any reference to social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Most previous studies require the specification of a minimum correlation threshold to perform the computation. However, it may be difficult for users to provide an appropriate threshold in practice because different data sets typically have different characteristics. To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative task: finding the top-k strongly correlated pairs. Consequently, we identify a two-dimensional monotone property of an upper bound of \u03d5 correlation coefficient and develop an efficient algorithm, called TOP-COP, to exploit this property to effectively prune many pairs even without computing their correlation coefficients. Our experimental results show that TOP-COP can be an order of magnitude faster than alternative approaches for mining the top-k strongly correlated pairs. Finally, we show that the performance of the TOP-COP algorithm is tightly related to the degree of data dispersion. Indeed, the higher the degree of data dispersion, the larger the computational savings achieved by the TOP-COP algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0265","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical algorithm for computing correlations in data without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

We examine the robust two-path problem, which seeks to establish two paths between a source and destination node wherein at least one path must remain fully operable with some threshold probability. We consider the case where both paths must be arc disjoint and the case where arcs can be shared between the paths. We examine various strategies for solving the resulting nonlinear integer program, including pruning, coefficient tightening, lifting, and branch-and-bound partitioning schemes.

The motivation for the development of this method came from the failure of a black-box-type approach implemented at United Airlines for solving such problems using column generation in concert with a commercial LP solver, where the software was observed to stall while yet remote from optimality. We identify a phenomenon called dual noise to explain this stalling behavior and present an analysis of the desirable properties of dual solutions in this context. The proposed deflected subgradient approach has been embedded within the crew pairing solver at United Airlines and tested using historical data sets. Our computational experience suggests a strong correlation between the dual noise phenomenon and the quality of the final solution produced, as well as with the accompanying algorithmic performance. Although we observed that our deflected subgradient scheme yielded an average speed-up factor of 10 for the column generation scheme over the commercial solver, the average reduction in the optimality gap over the same number of iterations was better by a factor of 26, along with an average reduction in the dual noise by a factor of 30. The results from the column generation implementation suggest that significant benefits can be obtained by using the deflected subgradient-based scheme instead of a black-box-type or standard solver approach to solve the intermediate linear programs that arise within the column generation scheme.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0267","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization method for airline crew scheduling without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For an approximation of this correct selection probability, we derive an asymptotically optimal allocation and propose an easy-to-implement heuristic sequential allocation procedure. Numerical experiments indicate that the resulting allocations are superior to other methods in the literature that we tested, and the relative efficiency increases for larger problems.

We show that the iterates of our method converge to a stationary point of the total expected revenue function of the smoothed version.

In this paper, we seek to extend the stream of research in supply chain management by systematically investigating the antecedents and performance outcomes of inter-organizational communication. Specifically, inter-organizational communication is proposed as a relational competency that may yield strategic advantages for supply chain partners. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically test a number of hypothesized relationships based on a sample of over 200 United States firms. Our results provide strong support for the notion of inter-organizational communication as a relational competency that enhances buyers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 performance. Implications for future research and practice are offered.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['communication', 'collaboration', 'performance']","The article focuses on inter-organizational communication and its impact on performance outcomes in supply chains, which is primarily technical and profit-focused.

We refer to this key activity in process innovation as external technology integration. This paper develops a conceptual framework of external technology integration based on organizational information processing theory and technology management literature. The primary hypothesis underlying the conceptual framework is that external technology integration will be most successful when the level of interaction between the source of the technology and recipient of the technology is appropriately matched, or fit, to the characteristics of the technology to be integrated. The conceptual framework also develops other hypotheses relating to contextual factors that may also influence the success of external technology integration. A cross-sectional survey methodology is employed to test the four hypotheses of the conceptual framework, with the results indicating strong support for the fit hypothesis and general support for the contextual hypotheses. The paper closes with a discussion of the implications of this study for both theory and practice.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.04.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of technology integration without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or DEI themes.

While such bundles are used in offline purchase negotiations, their criticality is heightened in online auctions due to their usual short duration and constrained bidding environment. Despite this importance, little systematic discussion or evaluation has taken place concerning bundling practice, especially as it relates to the individual items included in the bundle, the overall bundle composition, and the resulting supply base and ultimate bundle performance. This study investigates these issues by developing a conceptual model and testing it with a large-scale survey completed by purchasing professionals practicing bundling in B2B online auctions. Results indicate that crafting a more homogeneous bundle is most important in achieving a successful outcome. Furthermore, more complex or difficult-to-specify items do not impact perceived bundle performance, but do influence the supply base that is willing and able to bid on the business.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.05.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bundling in B2B online reverse auctions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2008","26","1","Sabyasachi Mitra,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Sabyasachi Mitra\n                     \n                        saby.mitra@mgt.gatech.edu\n                     \n                     College of Management, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, United States\n                     Tel.: +1 404 894 4365; fax: +1 404 894 6030.Corresponding author.

This paper analyzes the shareholder value effects of setting up industry exchanges, a prominent mechanism used to achieve supply chain integration. Shareholder value effects are estimated by measuring the stock market reaction (abnormal returns) associated with announcements to form or join industry exchanges. We find that abnormal returns from participation in industry exchanges are positive but only marginally significant in the whole sample of 144 firms in 18 exchanges formed during 2000\u20132001. In the sub-sample of 88 exchange founders who were part of the original announcements to form the exchange, the abnormal market reaction is about 1% and significant. We also find that firms with greater bargaining power and higher process efficiency benefit more from participation in industry exchanges.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.05.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on shareholder value and supply chain integration without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Despite this, prior literature has not adequately addressed supplier involvement in radical innovation, nor what the antecedents to increased supplier involvement are. We build and test a conceptual model of the antecedents and new product performance outcomes of supplier involvement in the development of radical innovation by new ventures. Antecedent variables (supplier's specific investments and the new venture's qualification of the supplier's abilities) are drawn from the transaction cost analysis literature. We include new venture's relative power and new venture's level of commitment to the supplier as contingency conditions. We develop a set of hypotheses relating supplier involvement to radical innovation performance, relating the antecedent variables to supplier involvement, and also testing the interaction effects of the two contingency conditions. We gather data from both new ventures and their major suppliers for 173 recent radical innovation projects, and use hierarchical regression analysis to test our hypotheses. We find that the contingency conditions moderate achieved levels of supplier involvement, and also find a direct relationship between achieved level of involvement and performance.

This consolidation and streamlining of common business functions is also known as insourcing, in-house services, business services, or staff services. While adoption of a shared service structure is viewed by many as an appropriate strategy to pursue, most companies still struggle to devise optimal strategies and to generate adequate returns on investments for their projects, because none of the approaches that are commonly adopted is recognized as universally effective.\n            \n            This paper builds upon the \u201cstructure-environment\u201d perspective to uncover configurations of shared services organizations and to explain why and under what circumstances some of these configurations exhibit superior results. The conceptual model proposed challenges the notion of \u201cbest practice\u201d and suggests that the effectiveness of a shared services project depends on the degree of complementarity between the \u201cneeds\u201d arising from the environment in which a company operates and the specific capabilities developed to address these needs. The theoretical findings are validated empirically through the analysis of a large sample of European firms that recently undertook initiatives in this domain. Four dominant configurations of shared service organizations are uncovered, and their relationship to performance is explored.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on cost reduction and efficiency in business services without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This research examines the perspectives of eight organizations through interviews with 10 high-ranking supply management executives. The paper first explores the rationale for offshore outsourcing among the organizations studied. Using the tenants of TCE, this paper postulates that fixed costs of establishing the relationship dominate the variable costs of day-to-day transactions, and that organizations will not offshore outsource areas where there is high perceived degree of unmanageable risk. The paper expands on themes provided by TCE and offers some lessons learned, and guidelines for managing and controlling offshore outsourced services relationships.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on transaction cost economics and the management of offshore outsourcing without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Although research to date has maintained that these practices are beneficial to the offshoring firm and national economies, by reducing costs and expanding markets, little is known about the longer term effect of offshoring on the rate of innovation of home economies. This paper suggests that offshoring practices have adverse effects on innovation at the national home base. The analysis uses patents in the rare-earth element industry, a high-tech area which is among those that have evolved the furthest towards outsourcing and relocation away from the US and to developing countries. Looking at the rare-earth industry can provide insights in identifying potential long term impacts of offshoring on innovation because many other US industries are likely to adopt similar offshoring strategies.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.013","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['offshoring', 'innovation', 'adverse effects']","The article discusses the negative impacts of offshoring on national innovation, which hints at ethical considerations regarding business practices.

Our analysis reveals that the ability of the vendor to forecast the task environment without bias and to gain sophistication in interpreting contract terms might make the firm indifferent between outsourcing and retaining front-end processes in-house. We validate our findings against the work of Apte and Mason [Apte, U.M., Mason, R.O., 1995. Global disaggregation of information-intensive services. Manage.

Drawing from organizational theories of learning, we build on this research by proposing a model that relates the pattern of supplier use of IT to specific types of supply chain coordination activities and a comprehensive set of organizational benefits. Specifically, we evaluate how two patterns of IT use by suppliers (exploitation and exploration) relate to two specific types of coordination activities with their buyers (operational and strategic coordination), which in turn are posited to promote specific organizational benefits. Using data from 241 first-tier OEM suppliers in the computer industry, our findings show that each pattern of IT use directly promotes a specific type of coordination activity. Although both types of coordination activities are needed to achieve both strategic and operational benefits, we find each coordination activity to be uniquely promoted by a specific pattern of IT use. IT use for exploitation is found to be an antecedent to operational coordination; IT use for exploration is found to be an antecedent to strategic coordination. No crossover between pattern of use and coordination activities is found. Our findings show that to achieve a complete set of benefits, suppliers must ultimately use IT for both exploration and exploitation. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of how the pattern of IT use can result in a comprehensive set of organizational benefits for supplier firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.07.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information technology use and its impact on supply chain coordination and performance, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2008","26","3","Xiande Zhao,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Xiande Zhao\n                     \n                        xiande@baf.msmail.cuhk.edu.hk\n                     \n                     Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics, Faculty of Business Administration, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, ChinaCorresponding author.

However, our knowledge of what influences SCI is still very limited. Although marketing and management researchers have investigated power and relationship commitment issues between organizations, few have examined their impact on SCI. This paper extends the power\u2013relationship commitment theory established in Western marketing literature and links it with SCI in China, through examining the relationship between power, relationship commitment and the integration between manufacturers and their customers. We propose and empirically test a model using data collected from 617 manufacturing companies in China. The results show that different types of customer power impact manufacturers\u2019 relationship commitment in different ways. Expert power, referent power and reward power are important in improving manufacturers\u2019 normative relationship commitment, while reward power and coercive power enhance instrumental relationship commitment. We also found that normative relationship commitment had a greater impact on customer integration than instrumental relationship commitment. These findings are interpreted in light of national culture differences between China and the U.S. in terms of power distance and collectivism, which provide a new perspective on SCI.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.08.002","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['power', 'relationship commitment', 'integration']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain integration and relationship dynamics without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, new demands on the supply-chain system require changes to information flow and exchange. We undertake a case study of three automotive supply chains that face such new demands resulting from the introduction of an order-driven supply-chain strategy. We use our case study findings to evaluate the applicability of three different theoretical lenses on the multi-faceted interactions between information, physical flow, and the complex rationales driving supply-chain evolution: the resource-based view (RBV), the concept of complex adaptive systems (CAS), and adaptive structuration theory (AST). We find that each theory has a separate realm of applicability and while complimentary in nature, provides distinct insight on the structural shift in the supply-chain system. More specifically, we find that AST, a theory prominent in the social sciences, provides novel insights to supply-chain research at the firm level, particularly with respect to the difficulties in using IT systems to drive systemic change. It complements both the system-level perspective offered by the complex adaptive systems theory, as well as the concept of dynamic capabilities originating in the resourced-based view. The paper concludes with wider implications for future research in supply and value chain management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.08.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['information flow', 'systemic change', 'social sciences']","The article primarily focuses on supply chain coordination and theoretical frameworks without a significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Using the theoretical lens of Dynamic Capabilities Theory and Resource-Based View, we postulate that online information and process act as resources that result in logistics fulfillment capabilities. These capabilities in turn lead to satisfaction with e-procurement. We estimate our research model using structural equation modeling with survey data collected from 131 purchasing and procurement managers. We empirically examine these linkages by analyzing data collected from procurement managers. Our results indicate strong support for the relationships between information flow process quality, logistics fulfillment quality processes, and e-procurement satisfaction performance. One of the surprising findings of our study is that fulfilled order timeliness has a significantly greater impact on satisfaction than fulfilled order accuracy. This finding points to the increasingly important role that the dimension of time plays in today's competitive environment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.08.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiency and performance metrics in e-procurement without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Building on the well-established motivation\u2013opportunity\u2013ability (MOA) framework, we posit that knowledge sharing among employees is a function of their MOA to do so. Existing literature suggests that the interaction among motivation, opportunity, and ability drives knowledge-sharing behavior. In contrast, we specify a new model in which the \u201cbottleneck\u201d or constraining factor among the MOA variables determines the degree of knowledge sharing that occurs. This constraining-factor model (CFM) fits the data better than the traditional multiplicative model and reveals a new, qualitatively different portrait of knowledge sharing that resolves some of the puzzles in the previous literature. The CFM provides macro-level insights with respect to how operations managers can improve employee knowledge sharing by focusing on the bottleneck MOA variable. As a result, the CFM can help set strategic directions of related policies. The model emphasizes that, counter to conventional wisdom, the MOA variables should not be addressed independently, but rather in a dynamic and coordinated way.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.09.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['knowledge sharing', 'motivation', 'opportunity', 'ability']","The article discusses knowledge-sharing behavior among employees, which touches on aspects of organizational behavior and employee engagement.

Drawing on social capital theory, we develop a model linking positive relational capital, and its antecedents, supplier integration and supplier closeness, to buyer performance improvements. Further, we hypothesize that structural capital, as reflected in managerial communication and technical exchanges, is also positively related to buyer performance improvements.

Supplier quality management and customer focus are two QM practices that are also clearly in the domain of SCM. In this study we investigate how these two supply chain management-related quality practices lead to improved performance and examine the practices that precede and mediate those relationships.

Supply management, the cornerstone of the integration of industrial supply chains, has evolved as a key research area. Based on quantitative and qualitative investigations of 225 electronics manufacturing firms, we examine the organizational impacts of strategic supply management (SSM) and the contexts of company size, process type, ISO 9000 certification, and quality management (QM) implementation that facilitate such an endeavor. We reveal that SSM is essentially a quality management initiative that requires bilateral efforts for continuous improvement and thus is not associated with the basic requirements of ISO 9000.

The standard aims to evaluate a firm's ability to effectively design, produce, and deliver quality products and services. This version of the standard tries to enhance customer satisfaction by including more top-management involvement and continual improvement. Despite widespread international acceptance, the new standard is surrounded by controversy similar to that surrounding its predecessor, the 1994 version. The literature is clearly divided in its assessment of ISO 9000:2000, which is viewed as either a quality management (QM)-based system or as another paper-driven process that increases risk, uncertainty, and costs.

In this paper we use the grounded theory approach and the scant literature available to propose an initial definition and theory of Six Sigma. Our research argues that although the tools and techniques in Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior approaches to quality management, it provides an organizational structure not previously seen. This emergent structure for quality management helps organizations more rigorously control process improvement activities, while at the same time creating a context that enables problem exploration between disparate organizational members. Although Six Sigma provides benefits over prior approaches to quality management, it also creates new challenges for researchers and practitioners.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.06.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['quality management', 'organizational structure', 'process improvement']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of Six Sigma and quality management without significant emphasis on socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The research investigates the links among organizational structure (formalization and integration), supply chain process variability, and performance as moderated by environmental uncertainty. We found that in a predictable demand environment, only formal control affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial results; but in an unpredictable demand environment, only cross-functional integration affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial performance. We also examined whether supply chain process variability is a complete or partial mediator of the relationship between organizational structure and performance, and found that: (1) in a predictable demand environment, supply chain process variability completely mediates the relationship between formal control and performance and (2) in an unpredictable demand environment, supply chain process variability partially mediates the relationship between integration and performance. Supply chain process variability has an inverse relationship with financial performance, regardless of the demand environment; and organizational structure provides managers with the mechanisms to mitigate this variability's detrimental impact on financial performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.10.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Proponents of such programs stress the promise of improved efficiency and profitability. But research has not consistently borne out these prospects. Moreover, the expectation of universal benefits is not consistent with research highlighting the important role of firm-specific capabilities in sustaining competitive advantage. In this paper, we use longitudinal panel data on ISO 9000 practices for firms in the auto supplier industry to study two new issues related to the adoption of process management practices. First, we find that, as the majority of firms within an industry adopt ISO 9000, late adopters no longer gain financial benefits from these practices. Second, we explore how firms\u2019 technological coherence moderates the performance advantages of ISO 9000 practices. We find that firms that have a very narrow or very broad technological focus have fewer opportunities for complementary interactions that arise from process management practices and thus benefit less than those with limited breadth in technologically related activities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.10.005","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of ISO 9000 practices and their impact on financial performance, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We establish professional service influence factors, which we posit will impact agency relationships in professional service firms. That is, we hypothesize that professional service influence factors (PSIFs) will moderate the effect of task programmability and outcome measurability in predicting the use of behavior- or outcome-based compensation schemes (control strategy). Logistic regression is used on data provided by 192 professional service providers in order to examine the impact of the agency variables and moderating factors on control strategies. The results indicate that company- and profession-based factors have moderating effects on task programmability when predicting control strategy.

However, the influence of employee attributes on these performance dimensions has rarely been examined. In this study we investigate the impact of employee satisfaction on operational performance in high-contact service industries. Based on an empirical study of 206 service shops in Hong Kong, we examined the hypothesized relationships among employee satisfaction, service quality, customer satisfaction, and firm profitability. Using structural equations modeling, we found that employee satisfaction is significantly related to service quality and to customer satisfaction, while the latter in turn influences firm profitability. We also found that firm profitability has a moderate non-recursive effect on employee satisfaction, leading to a \u201csatisfaction\u2013quality\u2013profit cycle\u201d.

There is a criticism that Six Sigma simply puts traditional quality management practices in a new package. To investigate this issue and the role of Six Sigma in quality management, this study reviewed both the traditional quality management and Six Sigma literatures and identified three new practices that are critical for implementing Six Sigma's concept and method in an organization. These practices are referred to as: Six Sigma role structure, Six Sigma structured improvement procedure, and Six Sigma focus on metrics. A research model and survey instrument were developed to investigate how these Six Sigma practices integrate with seven traditional quality management practices to affect quality performance and business performance. Test results based on a sample of 226 US manufacturing plants revealed that the three Six Sigma practices are distinct practices from traditional quality management practices, and that they complement the traditional quality management practices in improving performance.

After an extensive cross-disciplinary review of the general team and project management literatures, we constructed and tested a theoretically based, five-dimensional model of organizational context, project team design, project team leadership, project team processes, and project outcome factors. We examined the model by means of an empirical study of 56 newly completed capital projects executed by 15 Fortune 500 companies in the process industries. The results indicate the value of disaggregating project outcomes for research purposes. Different bundles of project team factors were found to drive project cost, schedule, and operability. Project team efficacy, cross-functional project teams, autonomous project team structure, and virtual office usage were the strongest predictors of project cost effectiveness. Continuity of project leadership, cross-functional project teams, and project manager incentives were the strongest predictors of project construction schedule. In contrast, clear project goals and an office design to facilitate effective communication were the main predictors of plant operability. Implications of these findings for researchers and project practitioners are discussed. One major practical implication of our findings is that project managers need to clearly focus and prioritize their goals for each project so they can adopt the appropriate bundles of project team practices that will facilitate their goal achievement.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.10.006","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['project team', 'leadership', 'cross-functional']","The article focuses primarily on project management efficiency and outcomes without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

While it is crucial to identify the operational performance that helps create competitive advantage, it is equally important to understand the means for delivering the needed performance at the operational level. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we argue that routines are a critical source of operations capabilities and subsequently investigate operations capabilities by means of their underlying routines. Because a common problem to studying capabilities is the ambiguous and confusing definitions, we conduct an extensive literature review to address the semantic confusion among various definitions of capabilities and delineate it from other related terms. We identify improvement and innovation as two critical plant level capabilities, each consisting of a bundle of interrelated yet distinct routines. We then empirically measure the two capabilities as second-order latent variables and estimate their effects on a set of operational performance measures. The results suggest that routines form internally consistent bundles which are significantly related to operational performance. This supports our notion of \u201ccapabilities as routine bundles\u201d that are difficult to imitate and thus a source of competitive advantage.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2007.11.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational performance and competitive advantage without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Drawing upon retailer and consumer perspectives, we articulate and justify a set of propositions regarding the relationships among different Internet retailer margins and promised product distribution service performance. We examine a sample comprising over 2000 retail transactions with customers and find partial empirical support for the set of propositions. Specifically, the results show that product margins and the margins on shipping and handling are inversely proportional. We also find a direct relationship between promised product distribution service performance and shipping and handling margins even after key product characteristics known to influence the cost side of the margin equation are controlled for. These results confirm an intuitively logical view of the relationships among pricing and promised product distribution service performance.

Many EUS studies in the past have attempted to identify the antecedents of EUS, yet most of the relationships found have been criticized for their lack of a strong theoretical underpinning.  Today it is generally understood that IS failure is due to psychological and organizational issues rather than technological issues, hence individual differences must be addressed.  This study proposes a new model with an objective to extend our understanding of the antecedents of EUS by incorporating three well-founded theories of motivation, namely expectation theory, needs theory, and equity theory.  The uniqueness of the model not only recognizes the three different needs (i.e., work performance, relatedness, and self-development) that users may have with IS use, but also the corresponding inputs required from each individual to achieve those needs fulfillments, which have been ignored in most previous studies.  This input/needs fulfillment ratio, referred to as equitable needs fulfillment, is likely to vary from one individual to another and satisfaction will only result in a user if the needs being fulfilled are perceived as \u201cworthy\u201d to obtain.\n\nThe partial least squares (PLS) method of structural equation modeling was used to analyze 922 survey returns collected form the hotel and airline sectors.  The results of the study show that IS end users do have different needs.  Equitable work performance fulfillment and equitable relatedness fulfillment play a significant role in affecting the satisfaction of end users.  The results also indicate that the impact of perceived IS performance expectations on EUS is not as significant as most previous studies have suggested.  The conclusion is that merely focusing on the technical soundness of the IS and the way in which it benefits employees may not be sufficient.  Rather, the input requirements of users for achieving the corresponding needs fulfillments also need to be examined.","https://misq.umn.edu/extending-the-understanding-of-end-user-information-systems-satisfaction-formation-an-equitable-needs-fulfillment-model-approach.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","6","['equitable', 'needs fulfillment', 'satisfaction', 'individual differences']","The article emphasizes 'equitable needs fulfillment' and acknowledges 'individual differences,' indicating a focus on fairness and inclusivity in user satisfaction.

By identifying the lead actors of the initiation, development, and approval stages in IT governance, the patterns of 57 IT investment decisions at 6 hospitals are analyzed.

Each archetype is analyzed by taking into account four specific factors:  IT investment level, external influence, organizational centralization, and IT function power. This study makes several contributions to IT governance theory and practice.  First, IT governance is reframed to include pre-decision stages, highlighting the importance of participants other than the final decision maker.  Second, the variation of IT governance archetypes suggests that even when top management approval is required, the IT department may not play a key role in the IT investment decision process.  Third, governance of the pre-decision initiation and development stages is found to be jointly affected by several contextual factors, suggesting that the allocation of final decision rights is only a part of IT governance.  While decision rights may be allocated by the organization a priori, the actual patterns of IT governance are contingent on contextual factors.

Innovation diffusion theory suggests that consumers make adoption decisions based on their perceptions of the relative advantage of the innovation.  The relative advantage of electronic channels is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct involving a cumulative assessment of the perceived relative merits of channels on three dimensions:  convenience, trust, and efficacy of information acquisition.  Combining the multidimensional nature of relative advantage with the multistage purchase process, the central assertion, and intended contribution, of this paper is to show that the relative advantage of electronic channels, and the influence of each dimension of relative advantage on the adoption of electronic channels, will vary across the different stages of the purchase process.\n\nSurvey data were collected from faculty and staff at a large university about their intention to use the web for auto insurance transactions.  The results provide support for the multidimensional nature of relative advantage, although the emergent factors do not align neatly with the hypothesized dimensions (convenience, trust, and efficacy of information acquisition) or stages.  Results of the study support three conclusions.  First, the dimensions along which consumers assess relative advantage blend hypothesized dimensions such as trust and convenience with stages of the purchase process.  Second, consumers consider the relative advantage of channels at two distinct stages of the purchase process:  gathering information and executing the transaction.  Third, different dimensions of relative advantage are critical in predicting consumer channel choice at each stage.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-relative-advantage-of-electronic-channels-a-multidimensional-view.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['consumer', 'trust', 'information acquisition']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and the technical aspects of electronic channels without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

By proposing that Information Systems researchers conduct applicability checks with practitioners on the research objects (for example, theories, models, frameworks, processes, technical artifacts, or other theoretically based IS artifacts) they either produce or use in theory-focused research, our paper presents an actionable, systematic approach to evaluating, establishing, and further improving research relevance.  Furthermore, because it is an approach that can be conducted as an additional step either at the beginning or the end of the traditional research life cycle, it leaves untouched the rigorous methods used to conduct the study, that is, it does not compromise traditional research models. \n\nThe approach we propose is based on the analyses of three dimensions of relevance that are critical to practitioners\u2019 attempts to internalize IS research findings (importance, accessibility, and suitability), and a comprehensive set of solutions that can be used to address them.  Our analysis reveals that the most critical dimension for practice is the importance of the research to the needs of practice.

The applicability check forms an integral part of the research process, either prior to or following engagement in a typical research process.

Fewer DSS studies have integrated decision process variables, such as user beliefs and attitudes, in their models.  In this paper, we examine the mediating role of decision process variables in the use of an online customer DSS.  We do so through an experimental study of an alternative-based and an attribute-based DSS for product customization by online customers.  Using cognitive fit and flow theories, we develop a theoretical model with four mediating decision process variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and perceived control) and two of their antecedents:  interface design (attribute-based versus alternative-based) and task complexity (choice set size).  Our results show that the impact of DSS interface design on behavioral intentions is fully mediated by perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, although not by perceived control.  Specifically, we verify that users of an attribute-based DSS express higher perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment than users of an alternative-based one.  In addition, we find that task complexity has an interesting relationship with usefulness and enjoyment, both of which follow an inverted U-shaped curve as choice set size increases.  Finally, we find that for users of the alternative-based DSS, perceived ease of use and perceived control decrease as task complexity increases.  However, the attribute-based DSS alleviates that decline for both variables.  Among other contributions, our results indicate the importance of including decision process variables when studying DSS as well as the complex effect of task complexity on those variables.  Our study also provides some important guidelines for online companies that provide customer DSS on their websites, especially the danger of providing too many product choice options that can overwhelm customers and harm their shopping experience.","https://misq.umn.edu/using-an-attribute-based-decision-support-system-for-user-customized-products-online-an-experimental-investigation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['decision support systems', 'user beliefs', 'user performance']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of decision support systems and user performance without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects?  This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects.  The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects.  The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors.  A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context.  The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution.  The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post- contractual extra costs for four types of activities:  (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination.  In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed.  Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure.  Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects.  Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects.  Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs.  Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect).","https://misq.umn.edu/explaining-variations-in-client-extra-costs-between-software-projects-offshored-to-india.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['offshoring', 'extra costs', 'cultural distance']","The article primarily focuses on economic factors and operational challenges related to offshoring without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Status Differences and Overlapping Boundaries in Offshore Collaboration","Increasingly, firms source more complex and strategic as well as harder to codify information technology projects to low-cost offshore locations.  Completing such projects successfully requires close collaboration among all participants.  Yet, achieving such collaboration is extremely difficult because of the complexity of the context:  multiple and overlapping boundaries associated with diverse organizational and national contexts separate the participants.  These boundaries also lead to a pronounced imbalance of resources among onshore and offshore contributors giving rise to status differences and inhibiting collaboration.  This research adopts a practice perspective to investigate how differences in country and organizational contexts give rise to boundaries and associated status differences in offshore application development projects and how these boundaries and status differences can be renegotiated in practice to establish effective collaboration.  To illustrate and refine the theory, a qualitative case study of a large financial services firm, which sourced a variety of high-end IT work to its wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201ccaptive centers\u201d) and to third party vendors in multiple global locations (in particular, to India and Russia), is presented.  Using a grounded theory approach, the paper finds that differences in country contexts gave rise to a number of boundaries that inhibited collaboration effectiveness, while differences in organizational contexts were largely mediated through organizational practices that treated vendor centers and captive units similarly.  It also shows that some key onshore managers were able to alleviate status differences and facilitate effective collaboration across diverse country contexts by drawing on their position and resources.

A Look at Offshoring in an Online Programming Marketplace","In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts.  We examined a particularly flat \u201cworld\u201d\u2014an online programming marketplace\u2014and found that this profound tilt to low-wage nations is overstated. We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects.  The data spanned 38 months and included over 263,000 bids by over 31,000 providers from 70 countries on over 20,000 small IT projects requested by over 7,900 clients from 59 countries.\n\nContrary to the world-is-flat proposition, the data in this particular site show some client preference for domestic providers.  However, the largest group of clients, the American clients, are a marked exception to clients in the rest of the world:  they give relatively less preference to domestic providers. In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, often very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider. Nonetheless, the strongest determinant of the winning bid is client loyalty: the client gives very strong preference to a provider with whom there has been a previous relationship, regardless of whether the provider is offshore or domestic.","https://misq.umn.edu/is-the-world-really-flat-a-look-at-offshoring-in-an-online-programming-marketplace.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['offshoring', 'low-wage nations', 'client preference']","The article discusses offshoring and client preferences, but it primarily focuses on economic factors rather than social justice or ethical implications.

Specifically, we model a domestic firm\u2019s use of a selective offshore strategy (i.e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor\u2019s large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge.  We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm\u2019s in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term.  Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project.  A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse.  However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor\u2019s economies of scale.

Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived.  The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, \nPhilips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had \u201cliberated\u201d what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product.  We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon.  The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success.  We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary.  Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness:  The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem.  The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.  It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.","https://misq.umn.edu/ourtsourcing-in-an-unknown-workforce-exploring-opensourcing-as-a-global-sourcing-strategy.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","4","['openness', 'trust', 'transparency', 'community', 'responsibility']","The article discusses themes of openness, trust, and transparency in the context of collaboration between commercial companies and open source communities, which suggests a moderate focus on ethical practices and community engagement.

Much  less is known about knowledge transfer problems associated with transformational technologies, which afford the creation, modification, and manipulation of digital artifacts.  Yet, these technologies play a critical role in offshoring by allowing the distribution of work at the task level, what we call task-based offshoring.  For example, computer-aided engineering applications transform input like physical dimensions, location coordinates, and material properties into computational models that can be shared electronically among engineers around the world as they work together on analysis tasks. Digital artifacts created via transformational technologies often embody implicit knowledge that must be correctly interpreted to successfully act upon the artifacts.  To explore what problems might arise in interpreting this implicit knowledge across time and space, and how individuals might remedy these problems, we studied a firm that sent engineering tasks from home sites in Mexico and the United States to an offshore site in India.  Despite having proper formal education and ample tool skills, the Indian engineers had difficulty interpreting the implicit knowledge embodied in artifacts sent to them from Mexico and the United States.  To resolve and prevent the problems that subsequently arose, individuals from the home sites developed five new work practices to transfer occupational knowledge to the offshore site.  The five practices were defining requirements, monitoring progress, fixing returns, routing tasks strategically, and filtering quality.  The extent to which sending engineers in our study were free from having to enact these new work practices because on-site coordinators acted on their behalf predicted their perceptions of the effectiveness of the offshoring arrangement, but Indian engineers preferred learning from sending engineers, not on-site coordinators.

As part of these companies, the Irish sites act as a bridge in their offshoring arrangements:  While the U.S. sites offshore work to Ireland, the Irish sites offshore work further to India and, hence, have experience of being both customer and vendor in two-stage offshore sourcing relationships. Using a framework derived from relational exchange theory (RET), we conducted multiple case study research to investigate and develop an initial theoretical model of the implementation of this two-stage offshoring bridge model.  Our study shows that while both companies act as bridges in two-stage offshoring arrangements, their approaches differ in relation to (1) team integration, (2) organizational level implementation, and (3) site hierarchy.  Although, there are opportunities afforded by the bridge model at present, the extent to which these opportunities will be viable into the future is open to question.  As revealed in our study, temporal location seems to favor a bridge location such as Ireland, certainly with United States\u2013Asian partners.  However, location alone will not be enough to maintain position in future two-stage offshoring arrangements.  Furthermore, our research supports the view that offshoring tends to progress through a staged sequence of progressively lower cost destinations.

This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses\u2014refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations\u2014that are classified into three categories:  information provision, private action, and public action.  Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antecedents\u2014concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining\u2014of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR.  The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users.  The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR.  These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR.  Such an understanding could enable researchers to analyze a variety of behavioral responses to information privacy threats in a fairly systematic manner.  Overall, this paper contributes to researchers\u2019 theory-building efforts in the area of information privacy by breaking new ground for the study of individuals\u2019 responses to information privacy threats.","https://misq.umn.edu/internet-users-information-privacy-protective-responses-a-taxonomy-and-a-nomological-model.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'justice', 'societal benefits']","The article discusses users' responses to privacy threats, incorporating themes of 'justice' and 'societal benefits,' which align with moderate woke themes of ethical considerations in information systems.

Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together.  We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes:  conveyance and convergence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes.  Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance.  For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance.  We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes.  The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium.","https://misq.umn.edu/media-tasks-and-communication-processes-a-theory-of-media-synchronicity.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on media synchronicity theory and communication processes without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

For instance, contrary to widespread claims, some researchers now argue the relationship between components and composites is not always transitive.  Moreover, how the part-of construct should be represented in a conceptual schema diagram remains a contentious issue.  Some analysts argue composites should be represented as a relationship or association.  Others argue they should be represented as an entity.

Over the time frame of our analysis, these core topics have remained quite stable.  However, the specific research themes within each core area have evolved significantly, reflecting research that has focused less on technology development and more on the social context in which information technologies are designed and used.

One is that such use prevents us from exposing the model\u2019s constructs to a robust test of their measure and relationships to each other, termed their nomological validity.  The other is that such use leaves us unsure about whether or not we have selected an efficient way, in terms of survey completion time, to assess these constructs.  Past researchers have used short form scales to address the issue of efficiency, but there are problems that may result from such efforts.  In this study, we address both shortcomings by exploring the use of a semantic differential scale, which we refer to as a fast form, to assess the constructs of TAM.  In this regard, we do three things.  First, we describe how fast form as a scale may be developed.  Second, we conduct a psychometric evaluation of the constructs that are measured by the fast form and examine their relationships.  Third, we assess the efficiency of the fast form by comparing the time required to complete a survey with it to that which is required to complete a survey with Likert scales.  Our results confirm that the constructs that are measured by the fast form are psychometrically equivalent to those that are measured by the Likert scales.  The relationship among these constructs was unchanged, providing strong evidence for nomological validity.  The fast form also yielded a 40 percent reduction in the survey completion time, proving its superior efficiency.  We conclude with a description of the implications of these results for research and practice.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-fast-form-approach-to-measuring-technology-acceptance-and-other-constructs.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of measuring constructs in technology acceptance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

CMC text analysis relies on systems capable of providing suitable navigation and knowledge discovery functionalities.  However, existing CMC systems focus on structural features, with little support for features derived from message text.  This deficiency is attributable to the informational richness and representational complexities associated with CMC text.  In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a design framework for CMC text analysis systems.  Grounded in systemic functional linguistic theory, the proposed framework advocates the development of systems capable of representing the rich array of information types inherent in CMC text.  It also provides guidelines regarding the choice of features, feature selection, and visualization techniques that CMC text analysis systems should employ.  The CyberGate system was developed as an instantiation of the design framework.  CyberGate incorporates a rich feature set and complementary feature selection and visualization methods, including the writeprints and ink blots techniques.  An application example was used to illustrate the system\u2019s ability to discern important patterns in CMC text.  Furthermore, results from numerous experiments conducted in comparison with benchmark methods confirmed the viability of CyberGate\u2019s features and techniques.

Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in acquiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment.  The sheer number of available technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging.  Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice.  We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model.  The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology development trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.  We adopt a process theory perspective and use a combination of visual mapping and quantification strategies to develop our artifacts and a state diagram-based technique to represent evolutionary transitions over time.

The ability to classify phenomena encountered in daily life in useful ways is essential to human survival and adaptation.  Not surprisingly, then, classification-oriented activities are widespread in the information systems field.  Classes or entity types play a central role in conceptual modeling for information systems requirements analysis, as well as in the design of databases and object-oriented software.  Furthermore, classification is the primary task in applications such as data mining and the development of domain ontologies to support information sharing in semantic web applications.  However, despite the pervasiveness of classification, little research has proposed well-grounded guidelines for identifying, evaluating, and choosing classes when modeling a domain or designing information systems artifacts.  In this paper, we adopt the cognitive notions of inference and economy to derive a set of principles to guide effective and efficient classification.  We present a model for characterizing what may be considered useful classes in a given context based on the inferences that can be drawn from membership in a class.  This foundation is then used to suggest practical design rules for evaluating and refining potential classes.  We illustrate the use of the rules by showing that applying them to a previously published example yields meaningful changes.  We then present an evaluation by a panel of experts who compared the published and revised models.  The evaluation shows that following the rules leads to semantically clearer models that are preferred by experts.

(2) What are the interactions between organizational incentives to form joint ventures and strategic alliances with competitors, and coordinate decisions vertically with downstream channel members? We focus on situations where spillovers are involuntary, firms' innovative activities are nonoverlapping, and firms benefit directly from the results of competitors' innovations. Under these conditions, we find that spillovers in process knowledge increase the likelihood of observing decentralized channel structures. Surprisingly, decentralized manufacturers invest more in process innovation than perfectly coordinated manufacturers do when spillovers are large. Moreover, in industries where large spillovers exist, horizontal cooperation among manufacturers induces higher levels of process innovation investments than channel coordination does. From a public policy perspective, however, the desirability of such cooperative arrangements among competitors depends on channel structure: joint ventures among decentralized manufacturers are more likely to meet the regulators' criteria of raising effort investments than cooperation among integrated manufacturers would be. Investment incentives are best provided when firms share their process knowledge and are buffered from subsequent price competition by independent retailers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0285","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of channel structure and knowledge spillovers without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our analysis accounts for observed and unobserved household heterogeneity as well as price endogeneity. The results hold for large basket-share categories and small basket-share categories, for consumer packaged goods and nonpackaged goods, for categories that are more likely to be purchased online because of their bulkiness or heaviness, and for categories that are more likely to be purchased offline because of their \u201csensory\u201d nature.

Our proposed model permits not only capturing the dynamics of customer relationships, but also incorporating the effect of the sequence of customer-firm encounters on the dynamics of customer relationships and the subsequent buying behavior. Our approach to modeling relationship dynamics is structurally different from existing approaches. Specifically, we construct and estimate a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model to model the transitions among latent relationship states and effects on buying behavior. In the proposed model, the transitions between the states are a function of time-varying covariates such as customer-firm encounters that could have an enduring impact by shifting the customer to a different (unobservable) relationship state. The proposed model enables marketers to dynamically segment their customer base and to examine methods by which the firm can alter long-term buying behavior. We use a hierarchical Bayes approach to capture the unobserved heterogeneity across customers. We calibrate the model in the context of alumni relations using a longitudinal gift-giving data set. Using the proposed model, we probabilistically classify the alumni base into three relationship states and estimate the effect of alumni-university interactions, such as reunions, on the movement of alumni between these states.

To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a new mechanism whereby price partitioning affects a consumer's perception of the secondary (i.e., nonfocal) benefits derived from a transaction. Four experiments support the hypothesis that a partitioned price increases the amount of attention paid to secondary attributes tagged with distinct price components. Characteristics of the offered secondary attributes such as their perceived value, relative importance, and evaluability can therefore determine whether price partitioning stimulates or hinders demand. Beyond its descriptive and prescriptive implications, this theory contributes to the emerging notion that pricing can transform, as well as capture, the utility of an offer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0295","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2008","27","2","Aradhna KrishnaAradhna Krishnaaradhna@umich.eduRoss School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109Search for more papers by this author, M.

Because demand exceeds supply for many courses, course allocation needs to be done equitably and efficiently. Many schools use bidding systems in which student bids are used both to infer preferences over courses and to determine student priorities for courses. However, this dual role of bids can result in course allocations not being market outcomes, and in unnecessary efficiency loss, which can potentially be avoided with the use of an appropriate market mechanism. We report the result of field and laboratory studies that compare a typical course-bidding mechanism with the alternate Gale-Shapley Pareto-dominant market mechanism. Results from the field study (conducted at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan) suggest that using the latter could vastly improve efficiency of course allocation systems while facilitating market outcomes. Laboratory experiments with greater design control confirm the superior efficiency of the Gale-Shapley mechanism. The paper tests theory that has important practical implications because it has the potential to affect the learning experience of very large numbers of students enrolled in educational institutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0297","","MKS","Marketing","3","['equitable', 'efficiency', 'allocation']","The article discusses equitable course allocation, which touches on fairness but primarily focuses on efficiency and market mechanisms rather than social justice or critical theory.

An implication of specialization is that the firm has forgone alternative opportunities. In the context of effort-intensive categories, we show that a firm can signal quality to consumers by specializing. In the model, a firm must decide to provide one service offering or to market two services. By entering a single category, the firm incurs an opportunity cost of not entering the secondary profitable category, but may attain reduced costs. The net cost is the signaling cost that a high-quality type firm incurs to signal quality over a low-quality type firm. We show that in homogenous markets, a high-quality type firm signals its high-quality type by specializing in one category. When consumers are heterogeneous, the firm can signal its high-quality type by using prices alone in both the primary and secondary categories. However, specialization can be used as a secondary signal of quality in heterogeneous markets because of lower signaling costs. We also find that signaling using specialization is more likely in the presence of competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0300","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market signaling and specialization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Furthermore, to satisfy heterogeneous consumer preferences within each quality tier, these firms also offer several variants for each brand. A natural outcome of this practice is interbrand variant overlap that could occur across tiers or within a tier. In this paper, we show that across-tier variant overlap is likely to diminish the preference of an upper-tier brand and enhance the preference of a lower-tier brand. We also find that variant overlap within a tier is likely to increase preferences of a brand belonging to the tier. Such variant overlap effects have important brand portfolio management implications for a multibrand firm. Specifically, we demonstrate that such a firm can enhance its portfolio profit under certain conditions by pruning its variants to reduce variant overlap. Because our paper relies on aggregate data, future research should investigate variant overlap at the individual level using panel or experimental data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1060.0262","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on brand management and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Depending on which of the four stylized cases is considered, a higher-value bidder may be allocated a higher-ranked or lower-ranked object.

Miswanting and Regret for a Standard Good in a Mass-Customized World","How can a standardized product survive in a mass-customized world? This requires understanding that consumers often experience problems predicting their future hedonic reactions to new experiences (such as custom products), leading to feelings of regret. This form of regret occurs not because the custom product differs from specifications, but because consumers miswanted the design they ordered. Our analytic model shows that regret aversion induces consumers to design custom products to reflect the attributes of the available standard products. Consequently, regret-averse consumers may choose the standard product rather than place a custom order. The number of available standard products, however, moderates both these effects. Two experiments empirically substantiate the key predictions of the analytical model: (a) the custom product's resemblance to the standard product grows with regret aversion associated with miswanting, (b) there exists a segment of \u201cregretfully loyal consumers\u201d for the standard product in a mass-customized world and it expands with regret aversion, (c) both the above effects are weakened by the presence of a second standard product, and (d) the custom product can increase its market share when the number of standard products increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0302","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making related to product customization and standardization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Conventional wisdom suggests that easier search creates a competition-intensifying effect that puts pressure on firms to lower their prices and reduce assortments. However, in our model we demonstrate that search also exhibits a market-expansion effect that encourages firms to expand their assortment\u2014easier search means that each firm is searched by more consumers. Because of broader assortments, consumers are more likely to find products that better match their ideal preferences, improving the efficiency of the market. In fact, we demonstrate that the market-expansion effect can even dominate the competition-intensifying effect potentially leading to higher prices, broader assortments, more profits, and expanded welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0304","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer search behavior and market dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Typically, a form of brand loyalty is detected whereby there is a higher probability of purchasing the same brand as has been purchased in the recent past. The economic significance of the measured loyalty remains an open question. We consider the category pricing problem and demonstrate that the presence of loyalty materially affects optimal pricing. The prices of higher quality products decline relative to those of lower quality when loyalty is introduced into the model. Given the well-known problems with the confounding of state dependence and consumer heterogeneity, loyalty must be measured in a model which allows for an unknown and possibly highly nonnormal distribution of heterogeneity. We implement a highly flexible model of heterogeneity using multivariate mixtures of normals in a hierarchical choice model. We use an Euler equations approach to the solution of the dynamic pricing problem which allows us to consider a very large number of consumer types.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0305","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Assuming the firms have asymmetric information about the demand volatility, we examine the potential benefits of sharing information and contracts that facilitate such cooperation. We conclude that under a wholesale price regime, information sharing might not improve channel profits when the retailer underestimates the demand volatility but the manufacturer does not. Although information sharing is always beneficial under a two-part tariff regime, it is in general not sufficient to achieve sharing, and additional contractual arrangements are necessary.

It is often claimed that illegal copying of intellectual property costs companies billions of dollars in lost revenues and reduces firms' incentives to innovate. Some researchers have shown that copying can be beneficial to firms when there are strong network effects and copying expands the market. In this paper, we first examine the impact of illegal copying of software and other similar intellectual properties on firms' prices, profits, and quality choices, even when there are no network effects and the market is saturated. We show that contrary to the claims of manufacturers, there are conditions under which copying can increase firms' profits, lead to better quality products, and increase social welfare. This is because weaker copyright protection enables firms to reduce price competition by allowing price-sensitive consumers to copy. Thus, weaker copyright protection can serve as a coordination device to reduce price competition. We also examine how equilibrium copyright enforcement is affected by network externalities. In contrast to previous research, we show that strong network effects can sometimes lead to a firm choosing higher levels of copyright protection. Our results show that in the presence of strong network effects, stronger copyright enforcement by one firm can serve as a coordinating device to reduce price competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0313","","MKS","Marketing","2","['copyright protection', 'social welfare', 'price competition']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of digital piracy without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Although such a contracting practice creates a considerable administrative effort and channel conflict, it is not clear whether such complexity is necessary for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision support system, SilverScreener, to capture strategic behaviors of channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler two-part tariff or 50/50 split contracts perform as well as the current contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts.

It is well known that pooling such demand information within a distribution channel improves supply chain logistics. However, little is known about how information-sharing affects wholesale pricing incentives. In this paper, we investigate a channel structure where a manufacturer and two retailers have private signals of the state of the demand. Our model identifies the presence of a pricing distortion, which we term the inference effect, when a manufacturer sets price to an uninformed retailer. Because of this inference effect, the manufacturer would like to set a low wholesale price to signal to the retailer that the demand is low. On the other hand, the manufacturer would like to set a high wholesale price so that he earns the optimal margin on each unit sold. Vertical information sharing benefits the manufacturer by eliminating the distortion caused by the inference effect, which is more profound in a channel whose retailer has a noisier signal. This result implies that when there is a cost associated with transmitting information, the manufacturer may choose to share information with only the less-informed retailer rather than with both.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0316","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information sharing and pricing strategies within a distribution channel without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Thus, for example, a firm may employ some of its advertising to promote price-related themes or messages and other of its advertising to promote product-related themes. This study examines the interdependence that can occur between pairs of themes in a pool (i.e., pooling effects), the impact of these pooling effects on the allocation of advertising expenditures, and the factors that can affect forgetting rates (or, conversely, carry-over rates) in a multitheme advertising environment. The study measures pooling, wear out, and forgetting (carry-over) effects for a campaign that uses five different advertising themes. To obtain these measures, I extend the linear Nerlove-Arrow (NA) (1962) model to a nonlinear model of advertising theme quality and goodwill and estimate the extended model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle filtering ideas. Particle filtering belongs to a class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods designed to estimate nonlinear/nonnormal state space models. Results show that forgetting (or carry-over) rates may be time varying and a function of prior goodwill (past advertising) and other advertising variables. Results show, moreover, that pooling effects can reduce theme wear out and, in turn, significantly improve advertising efficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0317","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

A probabilistic good is not a concrete product or service but an offer involving a probability of getting any one of a set of multiple distinct items. Under the probabilistic selling strategy, a multi-item seller creates probabilistic goods using the existing distinct products or services and offers such probabilistic goods as additional purchase choices. The probabilistic selling strategy allows sellers to benefit from introducing a new type of buyer uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in product assignments. First, introducing such uncertainty enables sellers to create a \u201cvirtual\u201d product or service (i.e., probabilistic good), which opens up a creative way to segment a market. We find that the probabilistic selling strategy is a general marketing tool that has the potential to benefit sellers in many different industries. Second, this paper shows that creating buyer uncertainty in product assignments is a new way for sellers to deal with their own market uncertainty. We illustrate two such benefits: (a) offering probabilistic goods can reduce the seller's information disadvantage and lessen the negative effect of demand uncertainty on profit, and (b) offering probabilistic goods can solve the mismatch between capacity and demand and enhance efficiency. Emerging technology is creating exciting (previously unfeasible) opportunities to implement PS and to obtain these many advantages.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0318","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical marketing strategy involving probabilistic goods and does not address any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Measurement of customer profitability and a deep understanding of the link between firm actions and customer profitability are critical for ensuring the success of the above decisions. We present the case study of how IBM used customer lifetime value (CLV) as an indicator of customer profitability and allocated marketing resources based on CLV. CLV was used as a criterion for determining the level of marketing contacts through direct mail, telesales, e-mail, and catalogs for each customer. In a pilot study implemented for about 35,000 customers, this approach led to reallocation of resources for about 14% of the customers as compared to the allocation rules used previously (which were based on past spending history). The CLV-based resource reallocation led to an increase in revenue of about $20 million (a tenfold increase) without any changes in the level of marketing investment.

Using two samples of business units, one for consumer goods and one for industrial goods, we find support for five of the six sources of pioneering cost advantage and disadvantage in both samples, while the advantage due to preemption of ideal market space is limited to the consumer goods sample. The unconditional analysis shows a pioneering purchasing cost advantage but even larger pioneering production and SG&A cost disadvantages. The complexity of our obtained findings suggests that managers need to think carefully about their particular conditions before making assumptions about the cost and, therefore, profit implications of a pioneering strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0324","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical testing of cost advantages and disadvantages related to pioneering strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, reflecting a purely technical and profit-oriented approach."],["2008","27","4","Dmitri G.

In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a brand's image is reinforced or impaired as a result of co-branding, and the characteristics of a good partner for a firm considering co-branding for image reinforcement. We address these issues by conceptualizing attribute beliefs as two-dimensional constructs: The first dimension reflects the expected value of the attribute, while the second dimension reflects the degree of certainty about the attribute. We argue that these parameters are updated after consumers are exposed to a co-branding activity, and we develop an analytical model that incorporates these notions. An analysis of the model leads to several propositions, which we test in an experiment. Our findings indicate that it is not necessarily in a brand's best interest to choose an alliance partner that is of the highest performance possible. Moreover, we find that, while expected values of the brand attributes may improve as a result of co-branding, under certain conditions the uncertainty associated with the brands increases through the alliance.

We discuss its implementation in the U.S. automotive industry, which \u201cspends\u201d about $45 billion each year in price promotions. The approach is based on a random effects multinomial nested logit model of product (e.g., a vehicle model, such as Hyundai Tucson), and transaction-type choice. Transaction types include combinations of acquisition types (e.g., purchase versus lease) and pricing instruments (cash rebates, reduced APR financing, lease payment discounts). We estimate the model using hierarchical Bayes methods to capture response heterogeneity at the local market level. We find key characteristics unique to durable-good markets. First, consumers are heterogeneous in both their brand and transaction-type preferences. Second, consumers differ in their overall price sensitivity as well as in their relative sensitivity to alternative pricing instruments (e.g., cash discounts, reduced monthly payments). Third, the most effective pricing programs tend to be those in which automakers offer consumers a menu of options to choose from (e.g., a choice among a cash discount, reduced interest rate financing, or a lease payment discount). We illustrate the model through an empirical application to a sample of data drawn from J.D.

This study proposes a methodology to determine the competitive salience of brands, based on a model of visual search and eye-movement recordings collected during a brand search experiment. We estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers' search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising. We show that about one-third of salience on the shelf is due to out-of-store and two-thirds due to in-store marketing. The proposed methodology for competitive salience analysis exposes the optimal visual differentiation level of a brand versus its competitors, and of each SKU versus the other SKUs of the same brand. The model of the visual search process and methodology for competitive salience analysis enable diagnostic analyses of the current levels of visual differentiation of brands and SKUs at the point of purchase, and provide directions for increasing these.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0327","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on brand salience and marketing strategies without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

As such, there seems to be specialization across sites in revenue models: high content sites tend to earn revenue from the sales of content, whereas low content ones earn revenue from the sales of traffic (advertising). In an extension, we also allow sites to establish (reference) out-links to each other and find that there is a general tendency to establish reference links to sites with higher content. Finally, we explore network formation in the presence of search engines and find that the higher the proportion of people using them, the more sites have an incentive to specialize in certain content areas.

In this paper, we examine the theoretical implications of these social forces for firm prices, product design, and target consumer selection. We show that the presence of reference group effects can motivate firms to add costly features, which provide limited or no functional benefit to consumers. Furthermore, reference group effects can induce product proliferation on one hand and motivate firms to offer limited editions on the other hand.

Results indicate that buyer valuations are affected by item, seller, and auction characteristics; buyer costs are affected by bidding behavior; and seller costs are affected by item characteristics and the number of listings. The model enables us to compute fee elasticities even though there is no variation in fees in our data. We find that commission elasticities exceed per item fee elasticities because they target high-value sellers and enhance their likelihood of listing. By targeting commission reductions to high-value sellers, auction house revenues can be increased by 3.9%. Computing customer value, we find that attrition of the largest seller would decrease fees paid to the auction house by $97. Given the seller paid $127 in fees, competitive effects offset only 24% of those fees. In contrast, competition offsets 81% of the buyer attrition effect.

Thus, we demonstrate a counterintuitive result: A common bias in individual decision making can help players to coordinate their decisions to obtain efficient outcomes. Further, limited steps of thinking alone cannot account for the observed asymmetric dominance effect. The effect appears to be due to increased psychological attractiveness of the dominating strategy, with our estimates of the incremental attractiveness ranging from 3%\u20136%.

Extant research pays little attention to the contingent efficacy of such global strategies from the perspective of MNC country subsidiary markets. We adopt the strategy-environment alignment principle and study how host country task- and institutional environments might influence the efficacy of global strategies for MNC subsidiary performance. We assess MNC subsidiary performance using subjective managerial judgments, and on the basis of recent research on human judgments, we theorize that these judgments embody information about judgment magnitude and uncertainty. A mean-variance function model simultaneously teases out the effects of the explanatory variables on the magnitude and uncertainty of MNC subsidiary performance judgments. To test the hypotheses, we analyze survey data from German and Japanese subsidiaries in the United States. The results support the use of the mean-variance function model and specific theory about the antecedents of performance judgment magnitude and uncertainty.

However, in explaining why established competitive brands continuously compete through periodic price promotions, most of the existing theories do not attribute this phenomenon to underlying consumer learning. Yet, \u201ctry it, you will like it\u201d is often the stated rationale of the practicing marketing manager in offering consumers a price promotion on a brand. This paper examines the connection between consumer learning and the offering of price promotions. The consumer model specified is Markovian in nature and encompasses in addition to consumer learning other empirical findings such as the increase in product class consumption in response to price reductions. The consumer models used in the existing game theoretic approaches to this problem are shown to be mostly special cases of the proposed model. It is demonstrated that for the commonly used price response functions the existence of consumer learning, at a level of intensity consistent with that identified in empirical works, makes it optimal for competing brands to periodically offer price promotions. Moreover, it is shown that the competing brands should promote in different periods as opposed to head to head.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0368","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer learning and price promotions without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

While this choice has been addressed from a theoretical perspective in both the marketing and economic literature, relatively little is known about how these decisions are made in practice, especially within a competitive environment. This paper exploits a unique store level data set consisting of every supermarket operating in the United States in 1998. For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that agree with those of its rivals. We also find a significant impact of various demographic and store/chain characteristics, providing some qualified support for several specific predictions from marketing theory.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0398","","MKS","Marketing","2","['demographic', 'pricing strategy']","The article primarily focuses on pricing strategies in supermarkets and does not emphasize social justice or ethical considerations.

While the literature has emphasized rationales based on screening, this paper looks at the implications of costly pricing. My analysis suggests that class pricing is more likely to be used when the number of buyers is smaller, the number of versions is larger, the variance in costs is smaller, and demand ex ante differs less between versions.

In bilateral trades, the most efficient game form is that in which classes are designed by the player with fewer varied gains from trade, while the traded version is chosen by the other player.

This information allows a firm to straightforwardly classify consumers as either \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cpast\u201d consumers. This opens the door for firms to implement marketing that (a) discriminates between new and past consumers and (b) entails making offers to them that are significantly different. Our objective is to examine the competitive effects of marketing that tailors offers to consumers based on their past buying behavior. In a two-period model with two competing firms, we assume that each firm is able to commit about whether or not to implement behavior-based discrimination (BBD), i.e., to add benefits to its offer for past consumers in the second period. When the firms are identical in their ability to add value to the second-period offer, BBD generally leads to lower profits for both firms. Past customers are so valuable in the second period that BBD leads to cutthroat competition in the first period. As a result, the payoffs associated with the implementation of BBD form a prisoner's dilemma. Interestingly, when a firm has a significant advantage over its competitor (one firm has the capability to add more benefits for its past customers than the other), it can increase its profit versus the base case even when there is significant competition in the second period. Moreover, the firm at a disadvantage sometimes finds that the best response to BBD by a strong competitor is to respond with a uniform price and avoid the practice completely.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0355","","MKS","Marketing","3","['discrimination', 'consumer', 'marketing']","The article discusses behavior-based discrimination in marketing, which touches on ethical considerations in consumer treatment.

Durable-Goods Monopoly with Network Effects","This paper studies the pricing problem of a durable-goods monopolist. It finds that contrary to the existing literature, profits from selling durable goods might be higher than from leasing when the products exhibit network effects. Under the influence of network effects, there exist multiple self-fulfilling equilibria that would sustain different network sizes at the same price. By using the assumption that consumers are cautious about network growth, we find that consumption externalities among heterogeneous groups of consumers generate a discontinuous demand function, which requires a lessor to offer a low price if she wants to reach the mass market. In contrast, a seller enjoys a relative advantage in that she can build a customer base by setting a lower initial price and raise the price later in the mass market. Our finding that selling can be more profitable than leasing holds when consumers are more cautious about the prospect of the product's success, which might be the case if, for example, the technology or manufacturer is relatively unknown.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0356","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic analysis of pricing strategies for durable goods and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We assemble an original database that includes the number of auto rental operators and other exogenous demand and cost conditions at every commercial airport in the country. The data are interesting because we observe a large variation in market structure, ranging from more than 100 monopoly and duopoly markets to several competitive airports with more than eight firms. In addition, we collect daily rental prices in each market that are regressed against the number of operating firms and other control factors. Due to potential biases in treating market participants as exogenously assigned, we employ a two-stage estimation procedure in which an equilibrium model of endogenous market structure provides correction terms for the second-stage price regression. Results show that ignoring the endogeneity of market structure severely underestimates the impact of additional competitors on prices, with the competitive interaction parameters doubling in magnitude after the correction procedure. The downward bias in the competitive parameter can have important implications for horizontal mergers, which may incorrectly appear innocuous when using a model that ignores the endogeneity of market structure. More generally, our results serve as a warning on the potential biases to a large number of applications in marketing and economics that attempt to relate outcome variables such as prices, markups, or profits to the observed market structure.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1070.0357","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market structure and pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper sheds light on this question by ascribing growth performance to firms' postlaunch marketing choices. We decompose the success of a new brand into its ultimate market potential and the rate at which it achieves this potential. To achieve this aim we formulate a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) of repeat purchase diffusion wherein growth and market potential are directly linked to the new brand's long-term advertising, promotion, distribution, and product strategy. We perform the analysis on 225 new-brand introductions across 22 repeat-purchase product categories over five years to develop generalized findings about the correlates of new-brand success. We find that access to distribution breadth plays the greatest role in the success of a new brand, and that investments in distribution and product innovation lead to greater marginal increases in sales for new brands than either discounting, feature/display, or advertising. Moreover, distribution interacts with other strategies to enhance their effectiveness. These findings underscore the utility of extending marketing mix models of new-brand performance to include product and distribution decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0358","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of marketing strategies and brand performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We estimate our proposed model using scanner panel data on ketchup. If price is important as a signal of brand quality, then frequent price promotion may have the unintended consequence of reducing brand equity. We use our estimated model to measure the importance of such effects.

To this end, we develop a method, called BidAnalyzer, which estimates dynamic bidding models and selects the most appropriate of them. Specifically, we enable model estimation by addressing the problem of partial observability; i.e., only one of N suppliers' bids is realized, and the other (N-1) bids remain unobserved. To address partial observability, BidAnalyzer estimates the latent price distributions of bidders by applying the Kalman filtering theory. In addition, BidAnalyzer conducts model selection by applying multiple information criteria. Using empirical data from an automotive parts auction, we illustrate the application of BidAnalyzer by estimating several dynamic bidding models to obtain empirical insights, retaining a model for forecasting, and assessing its predictive performance in out-of-sample. The resulting one-step-ahead price forecast is accurate up to 2.95% median absolute percentage error.

Thus, dissociation between these two types of measures should not be interpreted as failure to map utility onto money, as such mapping is not really attempted.

We illustrate the value of this idea by deriving and testing empirical predictions of disparities in the impact of different types of information and manipulations on the two types of value assessment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0364","","MKS","Marketing","3","['fairness', 'utility', 'value assessment']","The article discusses the concept of fairness in transactions and how it relates to value assessment, which introduces a moderate ethical consideration.

The importance of these dependencies is further shown by the substantive profit gains we obtain with our proposed shelf optimization approach. The basis of our model is a standard sales equation that explains sales using item-specific marketing effect parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) fashion, we augment this model with a second layer that relates the effect parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We also take into account potential endogeneity of facings. After estimating the parameters of the two-level model using Bayesian methodology, we carefully investigate the dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the shelf layout. Next, we search for the shelf arrangement that maximizes the expected total profit using simulated annealing (SA).

In cases where not all products are available at every consumer shopping trip, the observed market share is a convolution of two factors: consumer preferences and the availability of the product in stores. Failing to account for the varying degree of availability would produce incorrect estimates of the demand parameters. The proposed model uses information on aggregate availability to simulate the potential assortments that consumers may face in a given shopping trip. The model parameters are estimated by simulating potential product assortment vectors by drawing multivariate Bernoulli vectors consistent with the observed aggregate level of availability. The model is applied to the UK chocolate confectionery market, focusing on the convenience store channel.

Two experiments using a novel computer game show evidence of a valuation-usage disparity: Participants display a high willingness to pay for a new version of the game that offers a new set of controls, but fail to fully exercise the option to use these controls after purchase. This discrepancy is attributed to a fundamental difference in how new capabilities are valued at the time of purchase versus use. Consumer usage decisions appear to be driven by such myopic concerns as a desire to avoid short-term learning costs, whereas purchase decisions often fail to take into account the factors that drive usage, and are further inflated by global optimism in the future usefulness of new capabilities. We show that this lack of foresight can be explained by an intertemporal judgment model in which consumers attempt to value the option to use new capabilities as would be prescribed by economic theory, but are prone to hyperbolic discounting in their temporal valuation of present versus future costs and benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0367","","MKS","Marketing","2","['biases', 'valuation', 'consumer', 'decisions']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and economic theories without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Managers expect these forecasts to be \u201crealistic\u201d in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or \u201cbase-case\u201d scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1080.0369","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing research and decision-making without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Alternatively, once a title becomes available (i.e., formally released), consumers can obtain it upon purchase with minimal delay. We propose an individual-level behavioral model that captures the aggregate preorder/postrelease sales of motion picture DVDs. Our model is based on an optimal stopping framework. Starting with the utility function of a forward-looking consumer, and allowing for consumer heterogeneity, we derive the aggregate preorder/postrelease sales distribution. Even under a parsimonious specification for the heterogeneity distribution, our model recovers the typically observed temporal pattern of DVD preorder and sales, a pattern which exhibits an exponentially increasing number of preorder units before the release, peaks at release, and drops exponentially afterward. Using data provided by a major Internet DVD retailer, we demonstrate a number of important managerial implications stemming from our model. We investigate the role of preorder timing through a policy experiment, estimate residual sales, and forecast post-release sales based only on preorder information.

For a firm, it is important to form some expectations as to the lifetime value of each customer at the time a customer starts doing business with the firm, and at each purchase by the customer. In this paper, we use a hierarchical Bayes approach to estimate the lifetime value of each customer at each purchase occasion by jointly modeling the purchase timing, purchase amount, and risk of defection from the firm for each customer. The data come from a membership-based direct marketing company where the times of each customer joining the membership and terminating it are known once these events happen. In addition, there is an uncertain relationship between customer lifetime and purchase behavior. Therefore, longer customer lifetime does not necessarily imply higher customer lifetime value. We compare the performance of our model with other models on a separate validation data set. The models compared are the extended NBD\u2013Pareto model, the recency, frequency, and monetary value model, two models nested in our proposed model, and a heuristic model that takes the average customer lifetime, the average interpurchase time, and the average dollar purchase amount observed in our estimation sample and uses them to predict the present value of future customer revenues at each purchase occasion in our hold-out sample. The results show that our model performs better than all the other models compared both at predicting customer lifetime value and in targeting valuable customers. The results also show that longer interpurchase times are associated with larger purchase amounts and a greater risk of leaving the firm. Both male and female customers seem to have similar interpurchase time intervals and risk of leaving; however, female customers spend less compared with male customers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0746","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['gender', 'customer behavior', 'risk']","The article touches on gender differences in spending behavior, which introduces a moderate level of social awareness, but the primary focus remains on technical metrics and customer relationship management rather than social justice or equity themes."],["2008","54","1","Stefan HaefligerStefan Haefligershaefliger@ethz.chDepartment of Management, Technology, and Economics, ETH Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author, Georg von KroghGeorg von Kroghgvkrogh@ethz.chDepartment of Management, Technology, and Economics, ETH Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author, Sebastian SpaethSebastian Spaethsspaeth@ethz.chDepartment of Management, Technology, and Economics, ETH Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author","Code Reuse in Open Source Software","Code reuse is a form of knowledge reuse in software development that is fundamental to innovation in many fields.

However, the power of such models may tempt researchers to trust that they continue to produce reasonable estimates, when in fact either model misspecification or insufficient data limits the models' ability to recover household-level parameters successfully. If household-level choice behaviors are not recovered successfully, managerial decisions such as marketing-mix planning and targeting, direct marketing, segmentation, and forecasting may not produce the desired results. This study addresses the following questions. First, can random coefficients choice models correctly identify markets characterized by preference and response heterogeneity, state dependence, the use of alternative decision heuristics that result in reduced choice sets, and combinations of these effects? If so, how much data is required, and is this realistic given the size of data sets typically used in marketing analyses? Which model selection criteria should be used to identify these markets? When there is spurious market identification, which parameters contribute to the spurious result? An extensive simulation experiment is conducted wherein random coefficients logit models with varying specifications of parameter heterogeneity, state dependence effects, and choice set heterogeneity are applied to 128 experimental conditions. The results show which types of markets can be identified reliably and which cannot. Based on the results of the simulation, the authors develop a model selection heuristic that identifies the correct market in 81% of the experimental conditions. In contrast, strict application of the best model selection criterion alone results in correct market identification in at most 34% of experimental conditions. Interestingly, we find that the amount of data (number of households or number of purchases per household) does not affect our ability to identify the correct market type with this heuristic, so there is a good chance of identifying the correct market type even when little data is available.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0749","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing research and statistical modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, awareness formation models in the marketing literature ignore the role of competition. Consequently, we lack both the empirical knowledge and normative understanding of building brand awareness in dynamic oligopoly markets. To address this gap, we propose an N-brand awareness formation model, design an extended Kalman filter to estimate the proposed model using market data for five car brands over time, and derive the optimal closed-loop Nash equilibrium strategies for every brand. The empirical results furnish strong support for the proposed model in terms of both goodness-of-fit in the estimation sample and cross-validation in the out-of-sample data. In addition, the estimation method offers managers a systematic way to estimate ad effectiveness and forecast awareness levels for their particular brands as well as competitors' brands. Finally, the normative analysis reveals an inverse allocation principle that suggests\u2014contrary to the proportional-to-sales or competitive parity heuristics\u2014that large (small) brands should invest in advertising proportionally less (more) than small (large) brands.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0755","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brand awareness and advertising strategies without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2008","54","1","Marcelo OlivaresMarcelo Olivaresmolivares@columbia.eduColumbia Business School, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author, Christian TerwieschChristian Terwieschterwiesch@wharton.upenn.eduThe Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104Search for more papers by this author, Lydia CassorlaLydia Cassorlacassorla@anesthesia.ucsf.eduDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143Search for more papers by this author","Structural Estimation of the Newsvendor Model: An Application to Reserving Operating Room Time","The newsvendor model captures the trade-off faced by a decision maker that needs to place a firm bet prior to the occurrence of a random event.

This study develops a product recommendation model based on the principle that customer preference similarity stemming from prior purchase behavior is a key element in predicting current product purchase. The proposed recommendation model is dependent on two complementary methodologies: joint space mapping (placing customers and products on the same psychological map) and spatial choice modeling (allowing observed choices to be correlated across customers). Using a joint space map based on past purchase behavior, a predictive model is calibrated in which the probability of product purchase depends on the customer's relative distance to other customers on the map. An empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach provides excellent forecasts relative to benchmark models for a customer database provided by an insurance firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0760","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for product recommendation without addressing any social justice, diversity, equity, or inclusion themes.

The main responsibility to mitigate the hazmat transport risk at a population zone belongs to the government agency with jurisdiction over that region. One of the common policy tools is to close certain road links to vehicles carrying hazmats. In effect, the road network available to dangerous goods carriers can be determined by the regulator. The transport risk in the region, however, is determined by the carriers' routing decisions over the available road network. Thus, the regulator needs to make the road closure decisions so that the total risk resulting from the carriers' route choices is minimized. We provide a path-based formulation for this network design problem. Alternative solutions can be generated by varying the routing options included in the model for each shipment. Each solution corresponds to a certain compromise between the two parties in terms of transport risk and economic viability. The proposed framework can be used for identifying mutually agreeable hazmat transport policies. We present two applications of the methodology to illustrate the insights that can be gained through its use: The first application focuses on hazmat shipments through the highway network of Western Ontario, Canada, whereas the second application studies the problem in a much larger geographical region that covers the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0763","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['risk', 'policy', 'transport', 'safety']","The article discusses the risks associated with hazardous material transport and the role of government policy in mitigating these risks, which reflects a concern for public safety.

Evacuation decisions must be made on the basis of imperfect information, in the form of forecasts. The quality of these decisions can be improved if they are also informed by measures of uncertainty about the forecast, including estimates of the value of waiting for updated, more accurate, forecasts. Using a stochastic model of storm motion derived from historic tracks, this paper explores the relationship between lead time and track uncertainty for Atlantic hurricanes and the implications of this relationship for evacuation decisions. Typical evacuation clearance times and track uncertainty imply that public officials who require no more than a 10% probability of failing to evacuate before a striking hurricane (a false negative) must accept that at least 76%\u2014and for some locations over 90%\u2014of evacuations will be false alarms. Reducing decision lead times from 72 to 48 hours for major population centers could save an average of hundreds of millions of dollars in evacuation costs annually, with substantial geographic variation in savings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0764","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['evacuation', 'risks', 'public officials']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of evacuation decisions and economic implications, with minimal emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We hypothesize that the perceptions of a firm's efforts to provide quality content, to foster member embeddedness, and to encourage interaction foster favorable customer beliefs about and trust in a virtual community sponsor. Further, we hypothesize that trust motivates customers to behave relationally toward the sponsoring firm by sharing information with, coproducing new products with, and granting loyalty to, the sponsoring firm. Data from 663 customers are analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. We find that efforts to provide quality content and foster member embeddedness have positive effects on customer beliefs about the sponsor. In fact, fostering member embeddedness has a stronger explanatory effect on customer beliefs than does providing quality content. However, despite the fact that previous studies show that customers value interaction in virtual communities, our findings suggest that firms must do more than encourage interaction among their community members if they hope to create value from their virtual communities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0765","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['trust', 'member embeddedness', 'interaction']","The article discusses the importance of trust and member interaction within virtual communities, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

A core practice of extreme programming is pair programming, where two developers work on the same piece of code. We introduce the problem of assigning pairs of developers to modules so as to maximize the commonality\u2014a measure of the extent to which common developers work on related modules\u2014subject to a load-balancing constraint that is motivated by the need to control the completion time of the project. We consider two variants of this problem. In MCAPn, a developer is teamed up with exactly one other developer to form a pair that works together for the entire duration of the project. In MCAPs, we allow a developer to pair with more than one other developer during the project. This \u201cpair-splitting\u201d version of the problem facilitates knowledge dissemination among developers, but can increase the effort needed for a developer to adjust to the work habits of several partners. The difference between the commonality achieved with and without pair splitting crucially depends on the underlying structure of the problem. For trees, we show that the value of the maximum commonality is the same for both MCAPn and MCAPs. Additionally, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for both of these variants. For general graphs, both problems MCAPn and MCAPs are shown to be strongly NP-complete. We prove that the maximum commonality for MCAPs is at most 3/2 times the maximum commonality of MCAPn. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms and approximation results for a number of special cases of these problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0766","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development and algorithmic problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This vulnerability can be exploited by terrorist groups wanting to enter the United States. We construct a queueing model of the U.S. detention and removal operations, and derive approximate analytical expressions for key performance measures, including a simple normal approximation for the required number of beds. Due to shortcomings in the U.S. government's data collection procedures, we cannot directly estimate all of the model's parameter values. Consequently, we use the approximate analytical expressions and the 2003 U.S. government data quantifying these key performance measures to estimate several unknown parameter values. Although current funding is for approximately 21,000 detention beds, we estimate that approximately 34,500 beds are needed to remove all potential detainees (this does not include nonviolent, noncriminal Mexicans, who are returned to Mexico within several hours) based on 2003 data. The dramatic increase in the arrivals of potential detainees since 2003 suggests that approximately 50,000 beds are currently required, although the estimation of future arrival rates is very difficult due to uncertainties about the future direction of U.S. immigration policy. Our estimated bed requirements are approximately 25% higher than naive estimates that fail to account for right censoring of residence times due to some detainees being released from detention before removal to make way for higher-priority detainees.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0770","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['detention', 'illegal aliens', 'removal', 'capacity', 'vulnerability']","The article focuses on a technical analysis of detention capacity and does not engage with themes of social justice, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

An Empirical Investigation","This paper tests the notion of whether high preference for store brands leads to higher store loyalty. Our work differs from the earlier empirical evidence on this issue in how we define and measure the two key constructs: store-brand loyalty and store loyalty. To measure store-brand preference, we develop a multicategory brand choice to elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands, while controlling for other factors such as price sensitivity. The household-specific measures on store-brand preference and price sensitivity (along with other control variables) are then used to assess household store loyalty in the context of entry by a Wal-Mart supercenter in the market. Results show that store-brand buying behavior is driven by households' underlying \u201cvalue trait\u201d over and beyond what is captured by price sensitivity alone. In addition, these value-oriented households, which show high preference for store brands in the pre-entry period, shift a significantly higher level of their expenditures to Wal-Mart. These results are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom that high store-brand patronage is associated with a higher level of store loyalty.

Given that firms' resources to enhance costing accuracy are typically constrained, it is argued that costing system refinement efforts should be focused on such cases, where they are likely to be most effective. However, little guidance is available on how to identify those situations where costing system refinement efforts (such as introducing an activity-based costing system) are likely to pay off most in terms of increased accuracy. Further, to our knowledge, the existing guidance provided by this high diversity rule of thumb has never been empirically tested. Using a simulation method, we address these issues in this paper. Specifically, we model various aspects, and degrees, of diversity in the resource consumption patterns to be reflected by the costing system and find that more diversity in resource consumption patterns only leads to increased costing system sensitivity to errors for some of the aspects of diversity studied. We also identify situations in which allocating costing system refinement resources to cases characterized by high diversity in resource consumption patterns is detrimental to improved accuracy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0885","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['diversity', 'costing systems', 'accuracy']","The article discusses 'diversity' in resource consumption patterns, which indicates a moderate focus on DEI themes.

We start with a newsvendor seller facing forward-looking customers. The seller initially charges a regular price but may salvage the leftover inventory at a lower salvage price after random demand is realized. Customers anticipate future sales and choose purchase timing to maximize their expected surplus. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium, where we find that the seller's stocking level is lower than that in the classic model without strategic customers. We show that the seller's profit can be improved by promising either that quantities available will be limited (quantity commitment) or that prices will be kept high (price commitment). In most cases, both forms of commitment are not credible in a centralized supply chain with a single seller. However, decentralized supply chains can use contractual arrangements as indirect commitment devices to attain the desired outcomes with commitment. Decentralization has generally been associated with coordination problems, but we present the contrasting view that disparate interests within a supply chain can actually improve overall supply chain performance. In particular, with strategic customer behavior, we find that (i) a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale price contract may perform strictly better than a centralized supply chain; (ii) contracts widely studied in the supply chain coordination literature (e.g., markdown money, sales rebates, and buyback contracts) can serve as a commitment device as well as an incentive-coordinating device; and (iii) some of the above contracts cannot allocate profits arbitrarily between supply chain members because of strategic customer behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0886","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain performance and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Existing literature reports a few calibration exercises for social utility models, but the predictive accuracy of these models for out-of-sample forecasting remains unknown. Therefore, we investigate whether fairness considerations are stable enough across bargaining situations to be quantified and used to forecast bargaining behavior accurately. We develop a model that embeds a preference for fair treatment in a quantal response framework to account for noise and experience. In addition, we estimate preference for fairness (willingness to pay) using the simplest, one-round version of sequential bargaining games and then employ it to perform out-of-sample forecasts of multiple-round games of various lengths, discount factors, pie sizes, and levels of bargainer experience. Except in circumstances in which the bargaining pie is very small, the fitted model has significant and substantial out-of-sample explanatory power. The stability we find implies that the model and techniques might ultimately be extended to estimates of the influence of fairness on field negotiations, as well as across subpopulations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0887","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['fairness', 'negotiation', 'bargaining', 'social utility']","The article discusses fairness in bargaining behavior, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations within negotiation contexts.

We examine theoretically and empirically whether asking consumers to place a joint bid for multiple items, rather than bid one item at a time as practiced today, can increase NYOP retailers' profits. Relatedly, we also examine whether allowing consumers to self-select whether to place a joint bid or itemwise bids increases retailers' profits and consumers' surplus. We construct a dynamic model that incorporates both demand uncertainty and supply uncertainty to address these issues. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which joint bidding can increase both NYOP retailers' profits and consumers' surplus. We find that some consumers might bid more for the very same items when they place joint bids. The increase in bid amount is related to the fact that joint bidding reduces the chance of mismatch between NYOP retailers' costs and consumer bids. We conducted a laboratory study to assess the descriptive validity of some of the model predictions, because there are no field data on joint bidding in the NYOP channel. The results of the study are directionally consistent with our theory.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0888","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of a pricing strategy without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The initial model considers a single firm. We allow for consumer forgiveness where customers may flow back to the committed purchasing market from a nonpurchasing \u201clatent\u201d market. The per-period decisions include a marketing mix to attract latent and new consumers to the committed market and the setting of inventory levels. We establish conditions under which the firm optimally operates a base-stock inventory policy. The subsequent two models consider a duopoly where the potential market for a firm is now the committed market of the other firm; each firm decides its own inventory level. In the first model, the only decisions are the stocking decisions and in the second model, a firm may also advertise to attract dissatisfied customers from its competitor's market. In both cases, we establish conditions for a base-stock equilibrium policy.

We provide an alternative and somewhat complementary approach that considers demand-related issues, such as the existence of green segments, original equipment manufacturer competition, and product life-cycle effects. The profitability of a remanufacturing system strongly depends on these issues as well as on their interactions. For a monopolist, we show that there exist thresholds on the remanufacturing cost savings, the green segment size, market growth rate, and consumer valuations for the remanufactured products, above which remanufacturing is profitable. More important, we show that under competition remanufacturing can become an effective marketing strategy, which allows the manufacturer to defend its market share via price discrimination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0893","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['green segments', 'remanuacturing', 'sustainability']","The article discusses remanufacturing in the context of 'green segments' and sustainability, indicating a moderate focus on environmental concerns.

The last decade has seen active research in supply chain coordination focusing on the role of incentive contracts to achieve first-best levels of inventory. An extensive literature in industrial organization that studies incentives for vertical controls largely ignores the effect of inventories. Does the ability to carry inventory influence the problem of vertical control? Conversely, can inventories arise purely due to incentive effects? This paper explicitly considers both incentives and inventories, and their interplay, in a dynamic model of an upstream firm (supplier) and a downstream firm (buyer) who can carry inventories. In our model, none of the classical reasons for carrying inventory exists. However, as we prove, the buyer's optimal strategy in equilibrium is to carry inventories, and the supplier is unable to prevent this. These inventories arise out of purely strategic considerations not yet identified in the literature, and have a significant impact on the equilibrium solution as well as supplier, buyer, and channel profits. We prove that strategic inventories play a pivotal role under arbitrary contractual structures, general (arbitrary) demand functions and general (finite or infinite) horizon lengths. As one example, two-part tariff contracts do not lead to optimal channel performance, nor can the supplier extract away all of the channel profits, in our dynamic model. Our results imply that firms can and must carry inventories strategically, and that optimal vertical contracts must take the possibility of inventories into account.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0894","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and vertical contracts without any reference to socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

We hypothesize that managers also face a conflicting reporting incentive associated with their efforts to obtain external financing for the MBO and to lower their financing cost. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that managers who rely the most on external funds to finance their MBOs tend to report less negative abnormal accrual prior to the MBOs. In addition, the relation between external financing and abnormal accruals is tempered when there are more fixed assets that can serve as collateral for debt financing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0895","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and managerial incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

We show that this is not necessarily the case when a monopolistic input supplier also serves the firm's retail rival. In this case, the decision to buy the input (and thus become one of the supplier's customers) can limit the incentive the supplier would otherwise have to provide the input on particularly favorable terms to the retail rival.

Such dual distribution arrangements commonly suffer from excessive encroachment in that the manufacturer's ex post retail aggression is harmful ex ante because it undercuts potential wholesale profits. This paper demonstrates that with dual distribution, a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control and the use of transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of such concerns permits the manufacturer to credibly convey to its wholesale customer that it will not excessively encroach on its retail territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0906","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dual distribution and transfer pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Flexible firms can postpone production decisions until the actual demand curve is observed, but inflexible firms cannot. Under general demand structures and cost functions, we characterize the equilibrium for a symmetric duopoly and establish the strategic equivalence of price and quantity competitions when firms are flexible. We investigate the stochastic order properties of capacity and profit and show that they both increase for a flexible firm when the market is more volatile. We find that flexibility allows a firm to increase investment in capacity and earn a higher profit while benefiting customers by keeping the price in a narrower range; strategic equivalence implies that these properties are robust to market conjectures. We also show that flexibility plays an important role in mitigating the destructive effect of competition when the demand shock is additive; the destructive effect is nonexistent for firms facing multiplicative demand shock. When flexibility decision is endogenous, a firm's strategic flexibility choice depends on the cost of technology as well as the nature of demand shock. In particular, faced with a multiplicative demand shock, firms always choose to be inflexible, whereas all the possible equilibria are observed under additive demand shocks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0940","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of capacity investment and market competition without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper describes an equilibrium consumption-based CAPM framework based on Epstein-Zin preferences, which produces analytic pricing formulas for stocks and bonds under the assumption that macro growth rates follow affine processes. This allows the construction of equilibrium pricing formulas while maintaining the same flexibility of state dynamics as in no-arbitrage models. In demonstrating the approach, the paper presents a model that incorporates inflation such that asset prices are nominal. The model takes advantage of the possibility of non-Gaussian shocks and model macroeconomic uncertainty as a jump-diffusion process. This leads to endogenous stock market crashes as stock prices drop to reflect a higher expected rate of return in response to sudden increases in risk. The nominal yield curve in this model has a positive slope if expected inflation growth negatively impacts real growth. This model also produces asset prices that are consistent with observed data, including a substantial equity premium at moderate levels of risk aversion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0796","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical economic modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To examine which adopter characteristics matter, I use the introduction of a video-messaging technology in an investment bank. I use data on its 2,118 employees, their adoption decisions, and their 2.4 million subsequent calls. The video-messaging technology can also be used to watch TV. Exogenous shocks to the benefits of watching TV are used to identify the causal (network) externality of one individual user's adoption on others' adoption decisions. I allow this network externality to vary in size with a variety of measures of informal and formal influence. I find that adoption by either managers or workers in \u201cboundary spanner\u201d positions has a large impact on the adoption decisions of employees who wish to communicate with them.

The increasing collocation of the largest global firms in the cement industry since the 1980s is not easily attributed to either of these explanations. This paper draws on theories of multimarket contact to test whether strategic interaction across national markets has influenced the successive market entry decisions generating the observed agglomeration. We first establish that there is indeed nonrandom agglomeration of the six largest cement firms. We next show that preexisting cross-market interaction with current incumbents helps predict which firm will enter a given market and also the choice of market a given firm enters. The association does not appear to be caused by strategic convergence or mimicry of recent entry events and cannot be explained by production side effects, which depend only on local conditions. The findings are consistent with multimarket contact models where collocation allows firms to sustain higher prices in all markets. This latter inference is also supported by evidence of an association between global firm market share and local cement price. The paper suggests that pricing spillovers can serve as an alternative motivation for FDI agglomeration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0917","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on foreign direct investment and market strategies without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Evidence from the Automobile Industry","This paper examines the impact of vertical integration on the dynamics of performance over the automobile product development life cycle. Building on recent work in organizational economics and strategy, we evaluate the relationship between vertical integration and different dimensions of product performance. Outsourcing facilitates access to cutting-edge technology and the use of high-powered performance contracts. Vertical integration allows firms to adapt to unforeseen contingencies and customer feedback, maintain balanced incentives over the life cycle, and develop firm-specific capabilities over time. Together, these effects highlight a crucial trade-off: while outsourcing is associated with higher levels of initial performance, vertical integration will be associated with performance improvement over the product life cycle. We test these ideas using detailed data from the luxury automobile segment, establishing three key results. First, initial performance is declining in the level of vertical integration. Second, the level of performance improvement is significantly increasing in the level of vertical integration. Finally, the impact of vertical integration is mediated by the level of preexisting capabilities, by the salience of opportunities to access external technology leaders, and by the scope for learning over the product life cycle. Together, the findings highlight a strategic governance trade-off between short-term performance and the evolution of firm capabilities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0922","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing and vertical integration in the automobile industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In the presence of loyal consumers, for a large set of the parameters of the demand function, the firms use mixed strategies over a finite number of prices.

The attendant prescription is to invest more in R&D to derive greater benefit from the R&D of others (spillovers). Empirical tests of R&D productivity typically find absorptive capacity (R&D * rival R&D) to be significant. This result poses a puzzle, however: What can a firm conducting 50% of industry R&D learn from a set of firms each conducting 5%? Aren't the laggard firms merely playing catch-up? Yet, if this is so, why is the interaction term significant? One possible resolution to this puzzle is that the correlation between R&D spending and returns is really about innate ability (IQ) rather than investment behavior (absorptive capacity). In this view the causality between capability and behavior is reversed. It is not that firms obtain higher returns by investing more in R&D; it is that some firms have higher returns to R&D, thus they invest more. I conduct an empirical test of the competing views and find that (1) firms differ in the output elasticities of their own R&D (IQ) as well as the elasticities of spillovers from rivals, (2) absorptive capacity becomes insignificant when accounting for that heterogeneity, (3) R&D investment increases with IQ, but (4) R&D investment has no impact on a firm's ability to benefit from spillovers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0933","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of R&D productivity and organizational capabilities without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We consider two types of firms that compete on price and product variety: A traditional firm, which chooses a limited set of product configurations, and a customizing firm, which can produce any configuration to order. The traditional firm carries product inventories and experiences a lead-time delay. The customizing firm does not carry inventory, and its customers incur waiting costs until they receive their orders. We assume that the customizing firm has limited capacity in the short run (e.g., when it does not outsource production to high-volume manufacturers). We derive the equilibrium for a duopoly competition between the customizing firm and the traditional firm, study its characteristics, and compare it to a monopoly. We characterize conditions that favor customization under competition. We find that the customizing firm's profit is not monotone in the market size and its ease of customization. Similarly, a decline in the traditional firm's holding cost may increase or decrease its profit. We show that the unit cost differential between the firms crucially affects the customizing firm's ideal market size, its returns from expanding capacity, its product variety, and the way operational improvements affect its performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0935","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market competition and product configurations without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The problem is complicated by the fact that staffing level in one time period can affect the service levels in subsequent periods. Moreover, staff schedules typically take the form of shifts covering several periods. Interactions between staffing levels in different time periods, as well as the impact of shift requirements on the staffing levels and cost, should be considered in the planning. Traditional staffing methods based on stationary queueing formulas do not take this into account. We present a simulation-based analytic center cutting-plane method to solve a sample average approximation of the problem. We establish convergence of the method when the service-level functions are discrete pseudoconcave. An extensive numerical study of a moderately large call center shows that the method is robust and, in most of the test cases, outperforms traditional staffing heuristics that are based on analytical queueing methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0774","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for optimizing staffing in call centers without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We analyze five series of intraday arrivals for call centers operated by a retail bank in the United Kingdom. A notable feature of these series is the presence of both an intraweek and an intraday seasonal cycle. The methods considered include seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling; periodic autoregressive modeling; an extension of Holt-Winters exponential smoothing for the case of two seasonal cycles; robust exponential smoothing based on exponentially weighted least absolute deviations regression; and dynamic harmonic regression, which is a form of unobserved component state-space modeling. Our results indicate strong potential for the use of seasonal ARIMA modeling and the extension of Holt-Winters for predicting up to about two to three days ahead and that, for longer lead times, a simplistic historical average is difficult to beat.

Consequently, they often face constrained stochastic optimization problems, minimizing cost subject to service-level constraints. Complicating this problem is the fact that customer-arrival rates to call centers are often time varying. Thus, to satisfy their service goals in a cost-effective manner, call centers may employ permanent operators who always provide service, and temporary operators who provide service only when the call center is busy, i.e., when the number of customers in system increases beyond a threshold level. This provides flexibility to dynamically adjust the number of operators providing service in response to the time-varying arrival rate. The constrained dynamic operator staffing (CDOS) problem involves determining the number of permanent and temporary operators, and the threshold value(s) that minimize time-average hiring and opportunity costs subject to service-level constraints. We model the CDOS problem as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) and seek the optimal nonrandomized policy. The only exact method in the literature to obtain the optimal nonrandomized policy for a constrained MDP is enumeration, which is often computationally prohibitive. We provide a novel exact and efficient solution method, the modified balance equations disjunctive constraints (MBEDC) algorithm, yielding a mixed-integer program formulation; the computation times of this algorithm for sample problems are lower than enumeration by up to a factor of 200, and by a factor of 10 on average. Using our algorithm, we quickly solve diverse instances of the CDOS problem, generating managerial insights into the effects of temporary operators and service-level constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0819","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to call center staffing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The call center makes two strategic decisions: how many agents to have and how much effort to exert to achieve service quality. We are interested in the contracts the user company can use to induce the call center to both staff and exert effort at levels that are optimal for the outsourcing supply chain (i.e., chain coordination). Two commonly used contracts are analyzed first: piecemeal and pay-per-call-resolved contracts. We show that although they can coordinate the staffing level, the resulting service quality is below system optimum. Then, depending on the observability and contractibility of the call center's effort, we propose two contracts that can coordinate both staffing and effort.

Each cluster is referred to as a portfolio. Customers of the same portfolio are always served by an agent of the corresponding team. There is no specialization involved in this organization in the sense that all customer portfolios as well as all agent teams have (statistically) identical behaviors. The reason for moving to this organization is that dealing with teams of limited size allows a much better workforce management than the situation usually encountered in large call centers. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the benefits of moving to this new organization can outweigh the drawbacks. The drawbacks come from the fact that there is less of a pooling effect in the new organization than in the original one. The benefits come from the better human resource management that results in a higher efficiency of the agents, both in terms of speed and quality of the answers they provide to customers. Our analysis is supported by the use of some simple queueing models and provides some interesting insights. In particular, it appears that for some reasonable ranges of parameters, the new organization can outperform the original organization. We then extend the analysis to the case where, in addition to the identified customer portfolios, there is an additional flow of calls called out-portfolio flow. It is shown that this feature makes the new organization even more efficient.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0822","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['human resource management', 'efficiency', 'customer service']","The article focuses primarily on operational efficiency and workforce management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

The service provider receives an uncertain call volume over multiple periods and is considering outsourcing all or part of these calls to a contractor. Each call brings in a fixed revenue to the service provider. Answering calls requires having service capacity; thus implicit in the outsourcing decision is a capacity decision. Insufficient capacity implies that calls cannot be answered, which in turn means there will be a revenue loss. Faced with a choice between a volume-based and a capacity-based contract offered by a contractor that has pricing power, the service provider determines optimal capacity levels. The optimal price and capacity of the contractor together with the optimal capacity of the service provider determine optimal profits of each party under the two contracts being considered. This paper characterizes optimal capacity levels and partially characterizes optimal pricing decisions under each contract. The impact of demand variability and the economic parameters on contract choice are explored through numerical examples. It is shown that no contract type is universally preferred and that operating environments as well as cost-revenue structures have an important effect.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0823","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of call center outsourcing contracts and economic parameters without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The following question is addressed: How many servers are required (staffing) and how does one match them with customers (control) to minimize staffing cost, subject to class-level quality-of-service constraints? We tackle this question by characterizing scheduling and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as system load grows to infinity. The asymptotic regimes considered are consistent with the efficiency-driven (ED), quality-driven (QD), and quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regimes, first introduced in the context of a single-class service system. Our main findings are as follows: (a) Decoupling of staffing and control, namely, (i) staffing disregards the multiclass nature of the system and is analogous to the staffing of a single-class system with the same aggregate demand and a single global quality-of-service constraint, and (ii) class-level service differentiation is obtained by using a simple idle-server-based threshold-priority (ITP) control (with state-independent thresholds); and (b) robustness of the staffing and control rules: our proposed single-class staffing (SCS) rule and ITP control are approximately optimal under various problem formulations and model assumptions. Particularly, although our solution is shown to be asymptotically optimal for large systems, we numerically demonstrate that it performs well also for relatively small systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0825","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of staffing and control in service systems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This introduces the potential for reporting bias, a situation where traders exhibit different propensities to report different outcome types to the system. Unless properly accounted for, reporting bias may severely distort the distribution of public feedback relative to the underlying distribution of private transaction outcomes and, thus, hamper the reliability of feedback mechanisms. This study offers a method that allows users of feedback mechanisms where both partners of a bilateral exchange are allowed to report their satisfaction to \u201csee through\u201d the distortions introduced by reporting bias and derive unbiased estimates of the underlying distribution of privately observed outcomes. A key aspect of our method lies in extracting information from the number of transactions where one or both trading partners choose to remain silent. We apply our method to a large data set of eBay feedback. Our results support the widespread belief that eBay traders are more likely to post feedback when satisfied than when dissatisfied and are consistent with the presence of positive and negative reciprocation among eBay traders. Most importantly, our analysis derives unbiased estimates of the risks that are associated with trading on eBay that, we believe, are more realistic than those suggested by a na\u00efve interpretation of the unusually high (>99%) levels of positive feedback currently found on that system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0747","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['reporting bias', 'feedback mechanisms', 'trading risks']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of reporting bias in trading without addressing broader social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical implications.

Several external service vendors are available for this work. We develop models and analyses to support decisions concerning how responsibility for the warranty population should be divided between them. These also allow the manufacturer to resolve related questions concerning, for example, whether the service capacities of the contracted vendors are sufficient to deliver an effective post-sales service. Static allocation models yield information concerning the proportions of the warranty population for which the vendors should be responsible overall. Dynamic allocation models enable consideration of how such overall workloads might be delivered to the vendors over time in a way which avoids excessive variability in the repair burden. We apply dynamic programming policy improvement to develop an effective dynamic allocation heuristic. This is evaluated numerically and is also used as a yardstick to assess two simple allocation heuristics suggested by static models. A dynamic greedy allocation heuristic is found to perform well.

We show that ARVaR approximates the Conditional VaR of the portfolio as well.

The model presumes that the rate at which a manager's opportunity wage increases in his expertise depends on the nature of that expertise, i.e., whether it is general or firm specific. The analysis demonstrates that when managerial expertise is largely firm specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity is lower (higher) than its optimal value in a benchmark setting of symmetric information. Furthermore, when managerial skills are largely firm specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity decreases (increases) as managerial skills become a more important determinant of firm performance. Unlike the standard agency-theoretic prediction of a negative trade-off between risk and pay-performance sensitivity, this paper identifies plausible circumstances under which risk and incentives are positively associated. In addition to providing an explanation for why empirical tests of risk-incentive relationships have produced mixed results, the analysis generates insights that can be useful in guiding future empirical research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0785","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial compensation and performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Such systems typically produce a random quantity of vertically differentiated products. This product hierarchy enables the firm to fill demand for a lower-quality product by converting a higher-quality product. In addition to the challenges presented by random yields and multiple products, coproduction systems often serve multiple customer classes that differ in their product valuations. Furthermore, the sizes of these classes are uncertain. Employing a utility-maximizing customer model, we investigate the production, pricing, downconversion, and allocation decisions in a two-class, stochastic-demand, stochastic-yield coproduction system. For the single-class case, we establish that downconversion will not occur if prices are set optimally. In contrast, we show that downconversion can be optimal in the two-class case, even if prices are set optimally. We consider the benefit of postponing certain operational decisions, e.g., the pricing or allocation-rule decisions, until after uncertainties are resolved. We use the term recourse to denote actions taken after uncertainties have been resolved. We find that recourse pricing benefits the firm much more than either downconversion or recourse allocation do, implying that recourse demand management is more valuable than recourse supply management. Special cases of our model include the single-class and two-class random-yield newsvendor models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0807","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of coproduction systems and operational decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper argues that online consumer review, a type of product information created by users based on personal usage experience, can serve as a new element in the marketing communications mix and work as free \u201csales assistants\u201d to help consumers identify the products that best match their idiosyncratic usage conditions. This paper develops a normative model to address several important strategic issues related to consumer reviews. First, we show when and how the seller should adjust its own marketing communication strategy in response to consumer reviews. Our results reveal that if the review information is sufficiently informative, the two types of product information, i.e., the seller-created product attribute information and buyer-created review information, will interact with each other. For example, when the product cost is low and/or there are sufficient expert (more sophisticated) product users, the two types of information are complements, and the seller's best response is to increase the amount of product attribute information conveyed via its marketing communications after the reviews become available. However, when the product cost is high and there are sufficient novice (less sophisticated) product users, the two types of information are substitutes, and the seller's best response is to reduce the amount of product attribute information it offers, even if it is cost-free to provide such information. We also derive precise conditions under which the seller can increase its profit by adopting a proactive strategy, i.e., adjusting its marketing strategies even before consumer reviews become available. Second, we identify product/market conditions under which the seller benefits from facilitating such buyer-created information (e.g., by allowing consumers to post user-based product reviews on the seller's website). Finally, we illustrate the importance of the timing of the introduction of consumer reviews available as a strategic variable and show that delaying the availability of consumer reviews for a given product can be beneficial if the number of expert (more sophisticated) product users is relatively large and cost of the product is low.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0810","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['consumer reviews', 'marketing communication', 'user-generated content']","The article discusses consumer reviews and their impact on marketing strategies, which touches on user-generated content and consumer empowerment.

This paper shows that these results do not hold in general: each manufacturer's stocking level may be higher under RMI than under VMI and the retailer may lose by adopting VMI depending on the profit margin of the retailer relative to that of the manufacturers, the magnitude of the holding costs, and the intensity of brand competition.

Prior work has suggested that this mechanism has attractive features for the pricing of information and other low-marginal cost goods. Although closed-form solutions exist for this problem for certain cases of consumer preferences, many interesting scenarios cannot be easily handled without a numerical solution procedure. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency gains created by customized bundling over the alternatives of pure bundling or individual sale under different assumptions about customer preferences and firm cost structure, as well as the potential loss of efficiency caused by pricing with incomplete information about consumer reservation values. Our analysis suggests that customized bundling enhances sellers' profits and enhances welfare when consumers do not place positive values on all goods, and that this consumer characteristic is much more important than the shape of the valuation distribution in determining the optimal pricing scheme. We also find that customized bundling outperforms both pure bundling and individual sale in the presence of incomplete information, and that customized bundling still outperforms other simpler pricing schemes even when exact consumer valuations are not known ex ante.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0812","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies without any mention of social themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

Consumer brand choice is modeled as a multinomial probabilistic outcome, and the individual consumer-level transaction price is modeled to be consistent with the Nash bargaining solution. Our simultaneous model introduces a natural way to account for price endogeneity in a microlevel choice setting when the price paid is individual specific and correlated with the idiosyncratic preference of a buyer. It also accounts for the potential selectivity bias in studying the negotiated price by integrating consumer brand choice modeling. We apply the proposed model to a data set of 4,795 consumer automobile purchases. The empirical results show that the proposed approach not only better fits the data of consumer choice and negotiated price, but it also provides additional insights into buyers' and sellers' behaviors in comparison with models that study only consumer choice or the negotiated price, but not both simultaneously.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0815","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of consumer behavior and pricing strategies without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each product is made available at the supplier and absorbed by each retailer at given constant production and consumption rates. For each product, the unit inventory cost at the supplier is equal to the unit inventory cost at the retailers. Shipments can be performed in each discrete time instant by a fleet of vehicles of given transportation capacity, and routing is allowed. The aim is to determine shipping policies that minimize the sum of transportation cost and inventory cost both at the supplier and at the retailers. We study direct shipping policies, i.e., policies in which each retailer is served independently. We show the worst-case performance of the best single, best double, best triple, best frequency-based, and optimal direct shipping policies. In each of these policies each link is optimized independently. We prove that, in the worst case, the ratio between the cost of the optimal direct shipping policy and the optimal cost of the problem in which routing is allowed\u2014i.e., the worst-case performance bound of this policy\u2014is not greater than two whenever the unit volume on each link is not lower than 1/4 of the vehicle capacity. Moreover, if the unit volume is not lower than the capacity, the bound is about 1.21. These bounds are tight and obtained by applying frequency-based policies that make use of at most three different shipping frequencies and cannot be improved by allowing more frequencies or using time-based policies on each link. Computational results show that the best among the frequency-based direct shipping policies used to obtain the worst-case results gives an average percent increase error, with respect to a lower bound on the optimal cost of the problem in which routing is allowed, of 6.44% on a large set of randomly generated problem instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0768","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory and routing without any mention of social themes, diversity, ethics, or sustainability.

Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon policy for their disclosure. Disclosure policy (which sets a protected period given to a vendor to release the patch for the vulnerability) indirectly affects the speed and quality of the patch that a vendor develops. Thus, CERT/CC and similar bodies acting in the public interest can use disclosure to influence the behavior of vendors and reduce social cost. This paper develops a framework to analyze the optimal timing of disclosure. We formulate a model involving a social planner who sets the disclosure policy and a vendor who decides on the patch release. We show that the vendor typically releases the patch less expeditiously than is socially optimal. The social planner optimally shrinks the protected period to push the vendor to deliver the patch more quickly, and sometimes the patch release time coincides with disclosure. We extend the model to allow the proportion of users implementing patches to depend upon the quality (chosen by the vendor) of the patch. We show that a longer protected period does not always result in a better patch quality. Another extension allows for some fraction of users to use \u201cwork-arounds.\u201d We show that the possibility of work-arounds can provide the social planner with more leverage, and hence the social planner shrinks the protected period. Interestingly, the possibility of work-arounds can sometimes increase the social cost due to the negative externalities imposed by the users who are able to use the work-arounds on the users who are not.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0771","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['social cost', 'public interest', 'vulnerability']","The article discusses the social implications of software vulnerability disclosure, indicating some awareness of public interest and social costs, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects and optimization rather than social justice or equity themes."],["2008","54","4","Retsef LeviRetsef Leviretsef@mit.eduSloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139Search for more papers by this author, Robin RoundyRobin Roundyrobin@orie.cornell.eduSchool of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853Search for more papers by this author, David ShmoysDavid Shmoysshmoys@cs.cornell.eduSchool of Operations Research and Information Engineering and Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853Search for more papers by this author, Maxim SviridenkoMaxim Sviridenkosviri@us.ibm.comIBM T.

This paper examines how the use of the fixed fee in pricing contracts affects market outcomes of a manufacturer-retailer channel. Standard economic theories predict that channel efficiency increases with the introduction of the fixed fee and is invariant to its framing. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Surprisingly, the introduction of the fixed fee fails to increase channel efficiency. Moreover, the framing of the fixed fee does make a difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent. To account for these anomalies, we generalize the standard economic model by allowing the retailer's utilities to be reference dependent so that the up-front fixed fee payment is perceived as a loss and the subsequent retail profits as a gain. We embed this reference-dependent utility function in a quantal response equilibrium framework where the retailer is allowed to make decision mistakes due to computational complexity. The key prediction of this behavioral model is that channel efficiency decreases with loss aversion for sufficiently Nash-rational retailers. Consistent with this prediction, the estimated loss-aversion coefficient is 1.37 in the two-part tariff condition, significantly higher than 1.27 in the quantity discount condition. At the same time, loss aversion dominates contract complexity in explaining the data. Lastly, we conduct a follow-up experiment to confirm the central role of loss aversion as a behavioral driver. In one condition, the retailer becomes less loss averse when we temporally compress the fixed fee payment and the realization of retail profits, which supports the loss aversion theory. In the other condition, the retailer's contract acceptance rate does not decline when we reward the manufacturer a higher cash payment for each experimental point earned, which rules out the competing hypothesis that the retailer rejects contract offers due to fairness concerns.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0788","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['boundedly rational', 'framing', 'loss aversion']","The article primarily focuses on economic theories and behavioral models related to pricing contracts, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We characterize the distribution of IRI and show, using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), that 26.4% of the total variance in IRI lies between product categories and that 2.7% lies between stores. We identify several factors that mitigate record inaccuracy, such as inventory auditing practices, and several factors that exacerbate record inaccuracy, such as the complexity of the store environment and the distribution structure. Collectively, these covariates explain 67.6% and 69.0% of the variance in IRI across stores and product categories, respectively. Our findings underscore the need to design processes to reduce the occurrence of IRI and highlight factors that can be incorporated into inventory planning tools developed to account for its presence.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0789","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of inventory record inaccuracy without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

The model is a linear combination of underlying support for the event in question and a term that reflects a prior belief that all elements in the state space partition are equally likely. The model is consistent with known properties of subjective probabilities, such as binary complementarity, subadditivity, and partition dependence, and has several additional properties related to IA.

In both schemes, the component suppliers are allowed to freely form coalitions (or alliances) among themselves to better coordinate their pricing or production decisions. We show that the sole driver of the inefficiency in a push system, which is due to horizontal decentralization of suppliers, is the number of alliances that were formed. Specifically, it is shown that in a push system, the assembler's profit, the total profit of all suppliers and the consumers' surplus are all decreasing in the number of coalitions, and are thus maximized when the grand coalition is formed. We further carry out a stability analysis of coalition structures to verify to what extent suppliers can reduce or eliminate the inefficiency due to their decentralization by forming alliances. We show that in a push system with more than two suppliers and a power demand distribution, myopic suppliers would act independently, resulting with a least efficient channel, which makes all channel members, as well as the end consumers, worse off. On the other hand, we prove that farsighted suppliers would form the grand coalition and thus be able to completely eliminate the inefficiency stemming from their decentralization. Finally, it is shown that, in contrast to a push system, in a pull system the suppliers can easily coordinate their production quantities to eliminate the inefficiency due to their decentralization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0792","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decentralized assembly systems and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

An important problem within this context from a vendor's perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix vulnerabilities in its software. From a firm's perspective, the issue is how to update vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven release and update policies. We first study a centralized system in a benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release and update cycles are synchronized. Next, we consider a decentralized system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the firm selects its patch-update policy in a Stackelberg framework, assuming that release and update policies are either time driven or event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven update by the firm is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However, in this equilibrium, the patch-update cycle of the firm may not be synchronized with the patch-release cycle of the vendor, making it impossible to achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized system. Therefore, we next examine cost sharing and liability as possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality. However, liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless patch-release and update cycles are already synchronized without introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other. Finally, we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information asymmetry.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0794","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['socially optimal', 'cost sharing', 'liability']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of patch management and does not emphasize social justice or progressive themes.

In the first stage, the manufacturers decide whether to invest in information sharing. In the second stage, given the information structure created in the first stage, the manufacturers offer contracts to their retailers and the retailers engage in Cournot competition. We analyze the game for two different contract types. For the case of contract menus, a supply chain that does not have information sharing will lower its selling quantities because of the negative quantity distortions in the contract menus, thus creating a strategic disadvantage in Cournot competition. The value of information sharing to a supply chain is positive, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is to invest in information sharing when the investment costs are low. We fully characterize the equilibrium information sharing decisions under different investment costs. For the case of linear price contracts, the value of information sharing to a supply chain becomes negative, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is not to invest in information sharing regardless of investment costs. Our results highlight the importance of contract type as a driver of the value of information sharing and the role of information sharing capability as a source of competitive advantage under supply chain competition.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0795","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain competition and contracting without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

This paper proposes a new model that explicitly considers dyadic decision making in drug prescription and allows assessment of the relative influence that physicians and patients have in making decisions concerning new as well as existing ethical drugs. Modeling sequentially launched competing products in a category allows for parsing out effects that are hard to differentiate in models designed to capture only a single product's dynamics. The proposed model is applied to prescription drug data sets in the pharmaceutical industry, and it also explicitly captures both physicians' and patients' pretrial and posttrial utilities of each drug in the therapeutic category. Based on the model's fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance, we find that, in many cases, the incorporation of the dyadic decision making leads to better performance vis-\u00e0-vis models where such decision making is not explicitly considered. We also find that in many cases the posttrial utility of a drug is greater than its corresponding pretrial utility, lending partial empirical support to the prevailing industry practice of spending on various activities (e.g., sampling to physicians) needed to get potential patients to try a new drug. The proposed model enables managers to predict in advance the sales of sequentially launched new drugs and plan the new product launch and strategy accordingly. The model is also applicable to other product categories involving more than a single decision maker, including business-to-business products (e.g., office equipment) as well as to products targeting children (e.g., toys).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0798","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['ethical drugs', 'decision making', 'physicians', 'patients']","The article discusses ethical drugs and the decision-making process involving both physicians and patients, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations.

For example, the U.S. Government's policy of revealing losing bids may cause regret-sensitive bidders to anticipate regret and bid conservatively, decreasing the government's revenue. We test these predictions in the laboratory and find strong support for both.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0806","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding behavior in auctions without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This practice is in large part driven to obtain improved economies in transportation through higher truckload utilization. Recently, transportation rates, which are increasing faster than other costs, have become a larger portion of total net landed cost, placing the traditional quantity-discount practices under scrutiny. Many suppliers are left perplexed as to why their approach is not effective anymore, and some are even concerned that their overall profits may have actually decreased due to their discount parameters. In this paper, we study a multiperiod model, with a buyer facing stochastic end-item demand and a supplier offering an all-units quantity discount to him, to understand better the dynamics of such systems. We provide guidelines and insights on how to set effective discount parameters, and when not to expect much from them. We derive the optimal policy of the buyer, develop insights as to why the policy is complex, study the supplier's profit as a function of her offered quantity-discount scheme (accommodating the buyer's optimal policy), and discover a new phenomenon that is distinct and structurally different from the well-known bullwhip effect.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0829","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of quantity discounts and supply chain dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Customers place their orders in advance, and delivery is flexible in the sense that early shipment is allowed. Specifically, an order placed at time t by a customer with demand lead time T should be fulfilled by period t + T; failure to fulfill it within the time window [t, t + T] is penalized. We consider two situations: (1) Customer demand lead times are homogeneous and demand arriving in period t is a scalar dt to be satisfied within T periods. We show that state-dependent (s, S) policies are optimal, where the state represents advance demands outside the supply lead-time horizon. We find that increasing the demand lead time is more beneficial than decreasing the supply lead time. (2) Customers are heterogeneous in their demand lead times. In this case, demands are vectors and may exhibit crossover, necessitating an allocation decision in addition to the ordering decision. We develop a lower-bound approximation based on an allocation assumption, and propose protection-level heuristics that yield upper bounds on the optimal cost. Numerical analysis quantifies the optimality gaps of the heuristics (2% on average for the best heuristic) and the benefit of delivery flexibility (14% on average using the best heuristic), and provides insights into when the heuristics perform the best and when flexibility is most beneficial.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0831","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of inventory management and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Our characterization of this class of goods is that variable costs are invariant with quality, including the special case of zero variable costs. Our analysis assumes a monopoly firm that has an existing product in the market and has an opportunity to segment the market by introducing additional lower-quality versions. We derive a simple decision rule for determining the optimality of versioning based on the solution to a single-product maximization problem. Versioning is optimal when the optimal market share of the lower-quality version, offered alone, is greater than the optimal market share of the high-quality version, offered alone. A firm can profitably employ versioning for an information good if it can design the lower quality in a way that, relative to their valuations for the high-end version, high-type consumers have a lower relative valuation for the lower quality than do low-type consumers. When variable costs increase, a firm that offered only one product version need not consider adding another version. When variable costs decrease, the firm should explore adding a lower-quality version.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0773","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of versioning for information goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Less attention has been paid to the possible implications of modular architectures for imitation. To understand the implications of modular designs for competitive advantage, one must consider the dual impact of modularity on innovation and imitation jointly. In an attempt to do so, we set up three alternative structures that vary in the extent of modularity and hence in the extent of design complexity: nonmodular, modular, and nearly modular designs. In each structure, we examine the trade-offs between innovation benefits and imitation deterrence. The results of our computational experiments indicate that modularization enables performance gains through innovation but, at the same time, sets the stage for those gains to be eroded through imitation. In contrast, performance differences between the leaders and imitators persist in the nearly modular and the nonmodular structures. Overall, we find that design complexity poses a significant trade-off between innovation benefits (i.e., generating superior strategies that create performance differences) and imitation deterrence (i.e., preserving the performance differences). We also examine the robustness of our results to variations in imitation accuracy. In addition to documenting the overall robustness of our principal finding, the ancillary analyses provide a more nuanced rendering of the relationship between the architecture of complexity and imitation efforts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0775","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of modularity in organizational design and its implications for innovation and imitation, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2008","54","5","Emmanuel DechenauxEmmanuel Dechenauxedechena@kent.eduDepartment of Economics, Kent State University, Kent, Ohio 44242Search for more papers by this author, Brent GoldfarbBrent Goldfarbbrentg@umd.eduRobert H.

Exploiting a database of 805 attempts by private firms to commercialize inventions licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) between 1980 and 1996, we explore the influence of several appropriability mechanisms on the commercialization and termination of projects to develop products based on university inventions. Our central hypothesis is that the relationship between a licensee's decision to either terminate or commercialize the invention is driven by the current market value of the invention, as well as the option value of delaying its commercialization. We use a competing risks framework that allows for nonparametric heterogeneity and correlated risks. We find that better appropriability in the sense of more effective patent strength and secrecy has a strong negative effect on the hazard of license termination. The effectiveness of learning has a strong positive effect on the hazard of technology commercialization, while lead time has a negative effect.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0780","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of commercialization and appropriability mechanisms without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

New product designs often involve complex architectures and incorporate numerous components, and this makes the ex ante assessment of their performance difficult. Still, design teams often learn from test outcomes during iterative test cycles enabling them to infer valuable information about the performances of (as yet) untested designs. We conceptualize the extent of useful learning from analysis of a test outcome as depending on two key structural characteristics of the design space, namely whether the set of designs are \u201cclose\u201d to each other (i.e., the designs are similar on an attribute level) and whether the design attributes exhibit nontrivial interactions (i.e., the performance function is complex). This study explicitly considers the design space structure and the resulting correlations among design performances, and examines their implications for learning. We derive the optimal dynamic testing policy, and we analyze its qualitative properties. Our results suggest optimal continuation only when the previous test outcomes lie between two thresholds. Outcomes below the lower threshold indicate an overall low performing design space and, consequently, continued testing is suboptimal. Test outcomes above the upper threshold, on the other hand, merit termination because they signal to the design team that the likelihood of obtaining a design with a still higher performance (given the experimentation cost) is low. We find that accounting for the design space structure splits the experimentation process into two phases: the initial exploration phase, in which the design team focuses on obtaining information about the design space, and the subsequent exploitation phase in which the design team, given their understanding of the design space, focuses on obtaining a \u201cgood enough\u201d configuration. Our analysis also provides useful contingency-based guidelines for managerial action as information gets revealed through the testing cycle. Finally, we extend the optimal policy to account for design spaces that contain distinct design subclasses.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0784","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product design and testing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Whereas DE models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, AB models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. AB models relax aggregation assumptions, but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the dynamics of a stochastic AB model with those of the analogous deterministic compartment DE model. We examine the impact of individual heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of outcomes. More interestingly, the DE and mean AB dynamics differ for several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed, peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden. The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these differences in means are small compared to variability caused by stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous processes of diffusion and social contagion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0787","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['heterogeneity', 'policy analysis', 'public health']","The article discusses individual heterogeneity and its implications for policy analysis, which touches on social considerations, particularly in public health contexts.

An Empirical Study in the Automotive Industry","Component sharing\u2014the use of a component on multiple products within a firm's product line\u2014is widely practiced as a means of offering high variety at low cost. Although many researchers have examined trade-offs involved in component sharing, little research has focused on the impact of component sharing on quality. In this paper, we examine how component sharing impacts one dimension of quality\u2014reliability\u2014defined as mean time to failure. Design considerations suggest that a component designed uniquely for a product will result in higher reliability due to the better fit of the component within the architecture of the product. On the other hand, the learning curve literature suggests that greater experience with a component can improve conformance quality, and can increase reliability via learning from end-user feedback. The engineering literature suggests that improved conformance in turn increases reliability. Sharing a component across multiple products increases experience, and hence, should increase reliability. Using data from the automotive industry, we find support for the hypothesis that higher component reliability is associated with higher cumulative experience with a component. Further, we find support for the hypothesis that higher component reliability is associated with a component that has been designed uniquely for a product. This finding suggests that the popular design strategy of component sharing can in some cases compromise product quality, via reduced reliability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0791","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of component sharing and reliability in the automotive industry without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether IP has already been granted. In contrast, the need to disclose complementary (yet unprotected) knowledge, asymmetric information or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. We employ a data set combining information about cooperative licensing and the timing of patent allowances (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified). Although preallowance licensing does occur, the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement significantly increases after patent allowance. Moreover, the impact of the patent system depends on the strategic and institutional environment in which firms operate. Patent allowance plays a particularly important role for technologies with longer technology life cycles or that lack alternative appropriation mechanisms such as copyright, reputation, or brokers. The findings suggest that imperfections in the market for ideas may be important, and that formal IP rights may facilitate gains from technological trade.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0814","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of intellectual property rights and their impact on market efficiency, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2008","54","5","Don M.

The stochastic properties of revenue from innovations create a more difficult environment in which to value options than when the underlying is a security. There is no initial revenue, and cumulative revenue cannot decrease. Revenues from innovations are characterized by different lives and different rates of the resolution of uncertainty. A common deterministic model for predicting revenue from an innovation is known as the Bass model. We embed the Bass model in a gamma process, resulting in a stochastic process with moments proportional to the mean of the Bass model. To illustrate this model we choose the valuation of options on movie box office revenue. These options enable film distributors to manage the risk of a movie, and they offer diversification opportunities for investors. We develop the econometric methodology for ex ante parameter estimation and a Bayesian updating scheme using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation as data after release become available.

We characterize innovative effort through a normative theoretical framework that addresses a popular practice in NPD portfolio management: the use of strategic buckets. Strategic buckets encourage the division of the overall NPD resource budget into smaller, more focused budgets that are defined by the type of innovative effort (incremental or radical). We show that time commitment determines the balance between incremental and radical innovation. When managers execute this balance, they are often confounded by (i) environmental complexity, defined as the number of unknown interdependencies among technology and market parameters that determine product performance; and (ii) environmental instability, the probability of changes to the underlying performance functions. Although both of these factors confound managers, we find that they have completely opposite effects on the NPD portfolio balance. Environmental complexity shifts the balance toward radical innovation. Conversely, environmental instability shifts the balance toward incremental innovation.

Evidence of Self-Attribution Bias from Frequent Acquirers","We explore the history of mergers and acquisitions made by individual CEOs. Our study has three main findings: (1) CEOs' first deals exhibit zero announcement effects while their subsequent deals exhibit negative announcement effects; (2) while acquisition likelihood increases in the performance associated with previous acquisitions, previous positive performance does not curb the negative wealth effects associated with subsequent deals; and (3) CEOs' net purchase of stock is greater preceding subsequent deals than it is for first deals. We interpret these results as consistent with self-attribution bias leading to overconfidence.

At the same time, it creates an incentive for customers to strategize over the timing of their purchases. A firm should ideally account for this behavior when making its pricing and stocking decisions. In particular, we investigate whether it is optimal for a firm to create rationing risk by deliberately understocking products. Then, the resulting threat of shortages creates an incentive for customers to purchase early at higher prices. But when does such a strategy make sense? If it is profitable to create shortages, what is the optimal amount of rationing risk to create? We develop a stylized model to study this problem. In our model, customers have heterogeneous valuations for the firm's product and face declining prices over two periods. Customers are assumed to have identical risk preferences and know the price path and fill rate in each period. Via its capacity choice, the firm is able to control the fill rate and, hence, the rationing risk faced by customers. Customers behave strategically and weigh the payoff of immediate purchases against the expected payoff of delaying their purchases. We analyze the capacity choice that maximizes the firm's profits. First, we consider a monopoly market and characterize conditions under which rationing is optimal. We examine how the optimal amount of rationing is affected by the magnitude of price changes over time and the degree of risk aversion among customers. We then analyze an oligopoly version of the model and show that competition reduces the firms' ability to profit from rationing. Indeed, there exists a critical number of firms beyond which a rationing equilibrium cannot be supported.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0832","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on dynamic pricing strategies and profit maximization without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2008","54","6","Richard SaoumaRichard Saoumasaouma@ucla.eduAnderson Graduate School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095Search for more papers by this author","Optimal Second-Stage Outsourcing","Manufacturers have recently begun outsourcing product assembly and completion tasks to their suppliers. Such outsourcing solves several contracting problems but generates new incentive frictions between manufacturers and their suppliers. In this paper, we analyze a manufacturer's decision to outsource an assembly (second-stage) task to a preestablished supplier. We find that outsourcing second-stage tasks becomes more attractive as the cost of either the first- or second-stage activity rises. Outsourcing becomes less attractive when the supplier is unable to accept large levels of liability. The manufacturer is shown to prefer more testing when she outsources assembly to her supplier as opposed to when she assembles products in house.

Furthermore, through a no-arbitrage model, the paper links the dynamics and market pricing of the three risk dimensions to the term structure of U.S. Treasury yields and corporate bond credit spreads. Model estimation shows that positive inflation shocks increase Treasury yields and widen credit spreads on corporate bonds across all maturities and credit-rating classes. Positive real output growth shocks also increase Treasury yields, but they suppress the credit spreads at low credit-rating classes, thus generating negative correlations between interest rates and credit spreads. The financial market volatility factor has a small and transient effect on the Treasury yield curve, but it exerts a strongly positive and persistent effect on the credit spread term structure. The paper provides a robust and internally consistent method for extracting systematic economic information from a large array of noisy observations and establishing how different risk dimensions of the fundamental economy interact with interest rate and credit risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0835","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical economic analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The setting is one in which sellers market some item through solicitations to potential consumers, who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving solicitations. Concealment by one consumer induces sellers to shift solicitations to other consumers, whereas deflection does not. Solicitations cause two externalities: direct harm on consumers and the (indirect) cost of consumer concealment and deflection. We find that in markets where the marginal cost of solicitation is sufficiently low, efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less. Furthermore, concealment by low-benefit consumers increases direct privacy harm, and consumer welfare is higher with deflection than concealment. Finally, it is optimal to impose a charge on solicitations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0837","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['privacy', 'consumer', 'harm', 'solicitations']","The article discusses consumer privacy and the harm caused by marketing solicitations, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in marketing practices.

A Study of Cost Effectiveness in Hospital Drug Formularies","While research on the cost effectiveness of standardization to date has focused on the impact of different degrees of standardization, it has paid insufficient attention to the process an organization uses to formulate and implement standardized procedures. Drawing on the organizational decision-making literature and procedural fairness literature, this study identifies a number of key process features in standardization and argues that variations in these process features across organizations help account for the varying success of standardization in achieving cost effectiveness. Using hospital drug standardization for coronary artery and pneumonia cases to ground much of the argument, I analyzed inpatient discharge data from Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas, combined with an original survey of 243 hospital pharmacy directors. The results indicated that an increasing degree of standardization was associated with cost effectiveness when the level of formal objectivity in creating the standardized procedure was high and when there was due process in resolving disputes about the standardized procedure. This finding broadly supports the argument that the cost effectiveness of standardization depends not just on the degree of standardization but also on the process by which the standardized procedures are created and implemented.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0839","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['fairness', 'standardization', 'due process']","The article discusses procedural fairness in the context of standardization processes, which aligns with moderate woke themes of ethics and fairness in organizational practices.

One challenge is that the amount of information available to be potentially communicated may exceed salespeople's ability to communicate or customers' ability to process: there is limited \u201cbandwidth\u201d between the firm and customers. One important decision, then, is which information should customers see? What the firm chooses to tell customers may be informative in itself. When constrained to a \u201cseller-initiated information revelation\u201d format, where the firm chooses which feature to show, the firm never finds it optimal to offer more features than it is able to inform customers about. Consequently, customers never find credible a claim that the product has all features. The important implication is that price alone cannot serve as a signal of quality in this setting. In contrast, a \u201cbuyer-initiated information revelation\u201d format, where customers decide which information to receive, increases the probability of a sale and also results in the production of higher quality products. In a competitive setting, by adopting buyer-initiated information revelation, firms are able to attain positive profits. This is due to the fact that customers infer the product's quality from the price along with the information revelation format. Customers know that at some prices, firms find it profitable to produce high-quality products and at other, lower, prices, this is not the case. Thus, customer empowerment leads to higher profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0840","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['customer empowerment', 'information revelation', 'quality']","The article discusses 'customer empowerment' and the implications of information revelation formats, which touch on ethical considerations in sales practices.

The first factor can be interpreted as the level of the spread and the second factor is the volatility of the spread. The riskless interest rate is modeled using a standard two-factor affine model, thus leading to a four-factor model for corporate yields. This approach allows us to model the volatility of corporate credit spreads as stochastic, and also allows us to capture higher moments of credit spreads. We use an extended Kalman filter approach to estimate our model on corporate bond prices for 108 firms. The model is found to be successful at fitting actual corporate bond credit spreads, resulting in a significantly lower root mean square error than a standard alternative model both in sample and out of sample. In addition, key properties of actual credit spreads such as the stochastic volatility of the credit spreads and the positive skewness of the credit spread distribution are better captured by the model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0841","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of credit spreads and corporate bonds without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for lack of woke themes."],["2008","54","6","Alok KumarAlok Kumarakumar@mail.utexas.eduMcCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712Search for more papers by this author, Sonya Seongyeon LimSonya Seongyeon Limslim1@depaul.eduKellstadt Graduate School of Business, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois 60604Search for more papers by this author","How Do Decision Frames Influence the Stock Investment Choices of Individual Investors?","This study examines whether the framing mode (narrow versus broad) influences the stock investment decisions of individual investors.

Using this framing proxy, we show that investors who execute more clustered trades exhibit weaker disposition effects and hold better-diversified portfolios.

Many researchers have worked at understanding the impact of loyalty programs on market competition and the mechanism behind it. Interestingly, almost all of the studies have explored a symmetric equilibrium where both of the competing firms offer a loyalty program. To our knowledge, the extant literature has not investigated in-depth whether asymmetric equilibrium can exist where only one firm chooses to offer a loyalty program and the other firm chooses to compete via lowering prices. Such a question is important because some markets do support such asymmetric equilibriums with respect to loyalty programs. Also, the existence of asymmetric equilibrium shows that a loyalty program need not be profitable for some firms. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to investigate specific types of customer loyalty programs that provide benefit to loyal customers in the form of discount over market prices. The model considers consumer switching and includes two types of consumer heterogeneity. The first type of heterogeneity concerns the differences between customers with respect to their liking for loyalty programs, and the second type concerns the differences among the loyalty program members with respect to their ability to collect enough loyalty points to redeem loyalty rewards. By analyzing a duopoly market, we find that both symmetric equilibrium (i.e., where both competing firms offer the loyalty program) and asymmetric equilibrium (i.e., where one firm alone offers the loyalty program) can be sustained. The paper explores conditions for the existence of these two equilibriums.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0847","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['consumer heterogeneity', 'loyalty programs', 'discount']","The article primarily focuses on the profitability and market dynamics of customer loyalty programs without addressing any social justice or ethical themes.

Meanwhile, managers in such organizations infer from their histories of competitive success a biased assessment of their organization's ability to change.

Star analysts who switched employers experienced an immediate decline in performance that persisted for at least five years. This decline was most pronounced among star analysts who moved to firms with lesser capabilities and those who moved solo, without other team members. Star analysts who moved between two firms with equivalent capabilities also exhibited a drop in performance, but only for two years. Those who switched to firms with better capabilities and those who moved with other team members exhibited no significant decline in short-term or long-term performance. These findings suggest that firm-specific skills and firms' capabilities both play important roles in star analysts' performance. In addition, we find that firms that hire star analysts from competitors with better capabilities suffered more extreme negative stock-market reactions than those that hire from comparable or lesser firms. These findings suggest that hiring stars may be perceived as value destroying and may not improve a firm's competitive advantage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0809","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the performance of star knowledge workers and the implications of their mobility between firms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Proximity to Knowledge, Markets and Resources, and MNE Location Choices","We suggest that the proximity of a country to other countries is a factor that affects its choice as a multinational enterprise (MNE) location. We introduce the concept of a country's proximity to the global distribution of knowledge, markets, and resources, and frame this concept as a function of both geographic distance and the worldwide spatial distribution of these factors. We test our location model on a data set comprising 138,050 investments undertaken by U.S. MNEs worldwide. Our findings show that the proximity of a country to the rest of the world has a positive impact on MNEs choosing that country as a location. Proximity to the world's knowledge and markets are stronger drivers of location choice than is proximity to the world's resources, after accounting for the country's own endowments.

In this paper we help fill this gap by analyzing multiple determinants of time-to-build\u2014i.e., the time it takes a firm to build and ramp up operations at a new manufacturing facility. Theoretically, we develop predictions regarding the effects of competitive, firm, and technology characteristics on time-to-build. Empirically, we test our predictions on a sample of plant construction projects in the memory segment of the global semiconductor industry. We find that competition from rivals with superior technology is associated with shorter time-to-build, at least up to a point. Firm and industry experience are associated with shorter time-to-build. International projects, and those that push the technological frontier, take longer.

Formal conceptions of organizational learning typically include the assumption that payoffs immediately follow their antecedent actions, making the search for better strategies relatively straightforward. However, previous actions influence current organizational performance through their effects on organizational resources and capabilities. These resources and capabilities cannot be modified instantly, so delays\u2014from actions to changes in resources and capabilities to altered organizational performance\u2014are inevitable. Our computational experiments show that delays increase learning complexity and performance heterogeneity through two mechanisms. First, complexity of state-space and, therefore, of learning grows exponentially with delay length. Second, the time required to experience the benefits of long-term strategies means the intermediate steps of those strategies are initially undervalued, prompting premature abandonment of potentially fruitful regions of the strategy space. We find that these mechanisms often cause organizations to converge to suboptimal, routine-like cycles of actions, based on organizations' continually updated cognitive maps of how actions influence payoffs. Furthermore, the evolution of these cognitive maps exhibits path dependence, leading to heterogeneity across organizations. Implications for overcoming temporal complexity and the impact of initial cognitive maps are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0870","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['organizational adaptation', 'learning complexity', 'performance heterogeneity']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of organizational learning and performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The findings suggest that both exploratory and exploitative knowledge sharing lead to relationship performance gains, that such sharing is enabled by the ambidextrous management of the relationship, and that such sharing is facilitated by ontological commitment.

In an exclusive check-in counter system, each flight has a dedicated number of counters that will be open until at least a half-hour before the scheduled departure of that flight. Currently, in many of the airports around the world, the decision to open or close check-in counters is done on an ad hoc basis by human schedulers. In doing so, the schedulers are almost always forced to perform a balancing act in meeting the quality of service stipulated by the airport authority vis-\u00e0-vis the optimal allocation of the resources to the counters. There appear to be very few academic and application papers in counter management, and most of those that have looked into this problem have resorted to simulation to study the queue characteristics. Ours is the first paper to show that for a specific flight, this complicated problem is amenable to analytical treatment. We first propose a multicounter queueing model with a special type of arrival process reflecting reality from the population of passengers booked for the flight. Most importantly, we derive the time-dependent operating characteristics to the queueing process under a specified time-window constraint. Then a stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated to determine the optimal numbers of counters to open over the time window specified. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the model solution and gain managerial insights.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0842","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to resource allocation in airline check-in processes without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each retailer has some private information about the uncertain demand function which he may choose to disclose to the manufacturer. The manufacturer then sets a wholesale price based on the information received. The information exchange is said to be confidential if the manufacturer keeps the received information to herself, or nonconfidential if she discloses the information to some or all other retailers. Without confidentiality, information sharing is not possible because it benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailers. With confidentiality, all parties have incentive to engage in information sharing if retail competition is intense. Under confidentiality, the retailers infer the shared information from the wholesale price and this gives rise to a signaling effect that makes the manufacturer's demand more price elastic, resulting in a lower equilibrium wholesale price and a higher supply chain profit. When all retailers share their information confidentially, they will truthfully report the information and the supply chain profit will achieve its maximum in equilibrium.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0851","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain coordination and information sharing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We model this setting as a multiperiod single-product inventory problem where the demands for new items in different periods are independent and the demands for replacing failed items depend on the number and ages of the items under warranty. We consider backlogging and emergency supply cases, and study both discounted cost and average cost criteria. We prove the optimality of the w-dependent base-stock ordering policy where the base-stock level is a function of w, the vector representing the number of items at different ages currently under warranty. For the special case where the demand for new products is identically distributed, we prove the optimality of a stationary w-dependent base stock policy for the finite-horizon discounted and the infinite-horizon discounted and average cost cases. In our computational study, we find that an optimal w-dependent policy can lead to 69% average improvement in expected costs when compared to a policy that neglects demands from items under warranty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0863","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2008","54","8","Laurens G.

A credence service is one in which the customer cannot verify, even after a purchase, whether or not the amount of prescribed service was appropriate; examples include legal, medical, or consultancy services, and car repair. This creates an incentive for the expert to \u201cinduce service,\u201d that is, to provide unnecessary services that add no value to the customer, but that allow the expert to increase his revenues. We focus on the impact of an operations phenomenon on service inducement\u2014workload dynamics due to the stochasticity of interarrival and service times. To this end, we model the expert's service operation as a single-server queue. The expert determines the service price within a fixed and variable fee structure and determines the service inducement strategy. We characterize the expert's combined optimal price structure and service inducement strategy as a function of service capacity, market potential, inducement opportunity, value of service and waiting cost. We find that service inducement is a means to dynamically skim customer surplus with state-independent prices and provision of slower service to customers that arrive when the expert is idle. We conclude with design implications of our results in limiting service inducement.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0867","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of service pricing and customer dynamics without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Customer abandonment acts to keep the system stable, yielding a proper steady-state description. Motivated by fairness considerations, we assume that customers are selected for service by newly available servers on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) basis from all classes the corresponding service pools are allowed to serve. In this context, it is challenging to determine stationary routing flow rates between customer classes and service pools. Given those routing flow rates, each single fluid queue can be analyzed separately using previously established methods. Our ability to determine the routing flow rates depends on the structure of the network routing graph. We obtain the desired routing flow rates in three cases: when the routing graph is (i) a tree (sparsely connected), (ii) complete bipartite (fully connected), and (iii) an appropriate combination of the previous two cases. Other cases remain unsolved. In the last two solved cases, the routing flow rates are actually not uniquely determined by the fluid model, but become so once we make stochastic assumptions about the queueing models that the fluid model approximates.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0868","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['fairness', 'public housing', 'customer classes']","The article discusses fairness considerations in the context of tenant assignment in public housing, which aligns with themes of social equity and justice.

In this paper, we formalize the concept of near-misses and hypothesize that organizations and managers fail to learn from near-misses because they evaluate such events as successes and thus feel safer about the situation. We distinguish perceived (\u201cfelt\u201d) risk from calculated statistical risk and propose that lower levels of perceived risk encourage people with near-miss information to make riskier subsequent decisions compared to people without near-miss information. In our first study, we confirm the tendency to evaluate near-misses as successes by having participants rate a project manager whose decisions result in either (a) mission success, (b) near-miss, or (c) failure. Participants (both students and NASA employees and contractors) give similar ratings to managers whose decisions produced near-misses and to managers whose decisions resulted in successes, and both ratings are significantly different from ratings of managers who experienced failures. We suggest that the failure to hold managers accountable for near-misses is a foregone learning opportunity for both the manager and the organization. In our second set of studies, we confirm that near-miss information leads people to choose a riskier alternative because of a lower perceived risk following near-miss events. We explore several alternative explanations for these findings, including the role of Bayesian updating in processing near-miss data. Ultimately, the analysis suggests that managers and organizations are reducing their perception of the risk, although not necessarily updating (lowering) the statistical probability of the failure event. We speculate that this divergence arises because perceived risk is the product of associative processing, whereas statistical risk arises from rule-based processing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0869","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['learning', 'risk', 'accountability']","The article focuses primarily on decision-making processes and risk evaluation within organizations, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We first consider a system with two products 1 and 2 whose total demand is D and individual demands are negatively correlated. A fixed proportion of the unsatisfied customers for an item will purchase the other item if it is available in inventory. For the single-period case, we show that the optimal inventory levels of the two items can be computed easily and follow what we refer to as \u201cpartially decoupled\u201d policies, i.e., base stock policies that are not state dependent, in certain critical regions of interest both when D is known and random. Furthermore, we show that such a partially decoupled base-stock policy is optimal even in a multiperiod version of the problem for known D for a wide range of parameter values and in an N-product single-period model under some restrictive conditions. Using a numerical study, we show that heuristics based on the decoupled inventory policy perform well in conditions more general than the ones assumed to obtain the analytical results. The analytical and numerical results suggest that the approach presented here is most valuable in retail settings for product categories where the level of substitution between items in a category is not high, demand variation at the aggregate level is not high, and service levels or newsvendor ratios are high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0871","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The 2004 presidential election featured an active online prediction market at Intrade.com, where securities addressing many different election-related outcomes were traded. Using the 2004 data from this market, we examined three alternative models for these security prices, with special focus on the electoral college rules that govern U.S. presidential elections to see which models are more (or less) consistent with the data. The data reveal dependencies in the evolution of the security prices across states over time. We show that a simple diffusion model provides a good description of the overall probability distribution of electoral college votes, and an even simpler ranking model provides excellent predictions of the probability of winning the presidency. Ignoring dependencies in the evolution of security prices across states leads to considerable underestimation of the variance of the number of electoral college votes received by a candidate, which in turn leads to overconfidence in predicting whether that candidate will win the election. Overall, the security prices in the Intrade presidential election prediction market appear jointly consistent with probability models that satisfy the rules of the electoral college.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0872","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of prediction markets related to political events without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Finally (stage 3), the coalitions negotiate with the assembler on allocations of the supply chain's profit. We model the multilateral negotiations between the suppliers and the assembler sequentially, i.e., the assembler negotiates with one coalition at a time. Each of these negotiations is modeled using the Nash bargaining concept. Further, in forming coalitions we assume that players are farsighted. We then predict at equilibrium the structure of the supply chain as a function of the players' relative negotiation powers. In particular, we show that the assembler always prefers the outcome where suppliers do not form coalitions. However, when the assembler is weak (low negotiation power) the suppliers join forces as a grand coalition, but when the assembler is powerful the suppliers stay independent, which is the preferred outcome to the assembler.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0880","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical framework for supply chain negotiations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The system we investigate comprises retail outlets and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both retail outlets and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values of the number of retail outlets, the location of each retail outlet, and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each retail outlet. We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the retail outlets, the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented as a function of the number of retail outlets. Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of retail outlets. We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quantification of this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters.

Situational learning orientation may mitigate an employee's tendency to err. A situational learning orientation refers to the extent to which employees share the perception that there is an emphasis on improvement and on actively searching for additional knowledge and feedback in their department. The present study suggests that situational learning orientation interacts with two other organizational factors\u2014autonomy and voice\u2014as it influences employee errors, using the example of resident physicians' medical treatment errors. Senior nurses tallied the number of errors made by 123 residents from 25 departments over a three-month period. Results demonstrated that encouraging employee autonomy and voice fosters the benefits of learning by decreasing the number of treatment errors. Specifically, when the situational learning orientation was high, the number of errors decreased at an increasing rate as the perceived autonomy increased. When the learning orientation was low, there was a u-shaped relationship between autonomy and number of errors. In addition, only when the situational learning orientation was high did a higher employee voice lead to fewer treatment errors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0862","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['autonomy', 'voice', 'learning orientation']","The article discusses themes of employee autonomy and voice, which are associated with ethical organizational practices and employee empowerment.

However, in spite of their strategic importance, little is known about the optimal pricing policies or adoption drivers of CDNs. We address these questions using analytic models of CDN pricing and adoption under Markovian traffic and extend the results to bursty traffic using numerical simulations. When traffic is Markovian, we find that CDNs should provide volume discounts to content providers. In addition, the optimal pricing policy entails lower emphasis on value-based pricing and greater emphasis on cost-based pricing as the relative density of content providers with high outsourcing costs increases. However, when traffic is bursty and content providers have varying levels of traffic burstiness, volume discounts may be suboptimal and may even be replaced by volume taxes. Finally, when there is heterogeneity in burstiness across content providers, a pricing policy that accounts for both the mean and variance in traffic such as percentile-based pricing is more profitable than traditional volume-based pricing (metering bytes delivered in a given time window). This finding is in contrast to the current practices of many CDN firms that use traditional volume-based pricing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0875","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of content delivery networks, pricing strategies, and traffic models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because technologies are often configurable to serve a variety of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify multiple market opportunities prior to the first market entry of their emerging firms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore have a choice of which market to enter first. The empirical results presented in this paper offer three new insights regarding this important early-stage choice in new firm creation. First, they reveal that serial entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to generate a \u201cchoice set\u201d of alternative market opportunities before deciding which one to pursue in their new firm creation. Second, the analysis indicates that entrepreneurs who identify a \u201cchoice set\u201d of market opportunities prior to first entry derive performance benefits by doing so. Third, the positive relationship between the number of market opportunities identified prior to first entry and new firm performance is nonlinear and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has yet to acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting the most favorable market opportunity for the creation of a new technology firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0877","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market opportunity identification and entrepreneurial performance without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is due to the higher cognitive demands that videoconferencing places on participants. We report on a field study of medical professionals in which we found differences in information processing as predicted: participants attending a seminar via videoconference were more influenced by the likeability of the speaker than by the quality of the arguments presented, whereas the opposite pattern was true for participants attending in-person. We also found that differences in cognitive load explain these effects. The discussion on the theoretical model and associated findings explains why prior videoconference studies have not consistently found main effects for media.

We show that if uncertainty about the number of bidders is substantial, then the discriminatory pricing generates higher expected revenues than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price auction might generate higher revenues than the second-price auction. Therefore, uncertainty about the number of bidders is an important factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule.

In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the contest approach to innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0884","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['diverse', 'solutions', 'innovation']","The article discusses the benefits of having a 'diverse set of solutions' in innovation contests, which touches on the theme of diversity but primarily focuses on technical aspects of innovation and profitability rather than social justice or equity."],["2008","10","1","Yuyue SongYuyue Songysong@mun.caFaculty of Business Administration, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland A1B 3X5, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, Saibal RaySaibal Raysaibal.ray@mcgill.caDesautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, Shanling LiShanling Lishanling.li@mcgill.caDesautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author","Structural Properties of Buyback Contracts for Price-Setting Newsvendors","This paper studies a buyback contract in the Stackelberg framework of a manufacturer (leader) selling to a price-setting newsvendor retailer (follower). Using an analytical model that focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous results and produce new structural insights. A novel transformation technique first enables us to establish the unimodality of the profit functions for both channel partners, under relatively mild assumptions. Further analysis identifies the necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal contract for the manufacturer (wholesale and buyback prices) is distribution free, i.e., independent of the uncertainty in customer demand. A specific instance of the above condition is also necessary and sufficient for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective. We then prove that the optimal performance of the decentralized channel for distribution-free buyback contracts depends only on the curvature of the deterministic demand part. In addition, some of the optimal decisions and relevant profit ratios for buyback contracts in our setting are shown to be identical to those for their deterministic price-only counterparts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0140","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of buyback contracts and profit optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2008","10","1","Karthik RamachandranKarthik Ramachandrankarthik@cox.smu.eduCox School of Business, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas 75275Search for more papers by this author, V.

Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular upgradability can reduce the need for slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular upgradability and consider the implications for profits. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of product architecture with pricing and timing decisions for managing the introduction of rapidly improving products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1060.0143","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product architecture and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The literature only considers the issue of revenue generation in a very limited way, by allowing a job to remain unprocessed and its revenue contribution to be lost. By contrast, we consider three diverse practical situations where efficient scheduling affects revenue in much more general and realistic ways. First, we study two make-to-order environments where efficient scheduling increases customer goodwill, thus stimulating demand in different ways. Second, we study two make-to-stock environments where efficient scheduling creates inventory, thus also stimulating demand in different ways. Third, we study new product markets where efficient scheduling leads to a company becoming the first mover, and thus acquiring a larger market share. In each case, we provide both a computationally efficient algorithm for scheduling and a proof that a much more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist. For both the make-to-stock and make-to-order problems, we also describe heuristic approaches that are easy to implement, and we study their average performance. The results show that substantial benefits arise from considering the implications of efficient scheduling for revenue and net profit.

Demand from each source arrives dynamically according to an independent Poisson process. The cost of fulfilling each order depends on both the source of the order and its fulfillment location. Inventory at all locations is replenished from a shared production facility with a finite production capacity and stochastic production times. Consequently, supply lead times are load dependent and affected by congestion at the production facility. Our objective is to determine an optimal demand allocation and optimal inventory levels at each location so that the sum of transportation, inventory, and backorder costs is minimized. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy. We show that the optimal demand allocations are always discrete, with demand from each source always fulfilled entirely from a single inventory location. We use this discreteness property to reformulate the problems as a mixed-integer linear program and provide an exact solution procedure. We show that this discreteness property extends to systems with other forms of supply processes. However, we also show that supply systems exist for which the property does not hold.

To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0167","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['collaboration', 'information security', 'efficiency']","The article primarily focuses on technical solutions for operational efficiency and information security without any significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The mass customizer (MC) has a perfectly flexible production technology and thus can offer any variety within a product space, represented by Hotelling's linear city. The mass producer (MP) has a more focused production technology and therefore offers a finite set of products in the same space. The MP can invest in more flexible technology, which reduces its cost of variety and hence allows it to offer a larger set of products; in the extreme, the MP can emulate the MC's technology and offer infinite variety. The firms simultaneously decide whether to enter the market, and the MP chooses its degree of product-mix flexibility on entry. Next, the MP designs its product line\u2014i.e., the number and position of its products\u2014the MC's perfectly flexible technology makes this unnecessary. Finally, both firms simultaneously set prices. We analyze the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in this three-stage game, allowing firm-specific fixed and variable costs that together characterize their production technology. We find that an MP facing competition from an MC offers lower product variety than an MP monopolist to reduce the intensity of price competition. We also find that the MP can survive this competition, even if it has higher fixed cost of production technology, higher marginal cost of production, or both.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0155","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition and production technologies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, it was found that reduction in mean setup times without any change in variance can, paradoxically, increase waiting time and work in process (WIP) in a cyclic production system. Setup time variance was demonstrated to play a central role because of the paradoxes it produced with the resulting harm to effective capacity. Subsequently, explicit formulas were derived for determining whether adding fixed forced idle time (but holding variance constant) would reduce waiting time and, if so, the optimal amount of idle time to add. However, research to date has offered little guidance to reduce setup time variance to improve waiting time. We show that a greater reduction is achievable by adding a variable idle time that is a nonincreasing function of setup time and thereby reduce the combined setup time variance. We provide explicit procedures for finding the optimal variable idle time as a function of setup time when the latter follows any finite discrete distribution. We also show how to implement our policy and show that our approach can improve waiting time even when other currently known approaches cannot.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0161","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of production systems and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

[Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing \u201cflexible products\u201d\u2014a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e.g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e.g., an origin-destination connection)\u2014their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of \u201cefficiency\u201d developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci.50 15\u201333.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying \u201cgood\u201d offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0169","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for revenue management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely profit-focused approach."],["2008","10","2","Sheng Hao ZhangSheng Hao Zhangshzhang@mail.xjtu.edu.cnDepartment of Industrial Engineering, School of Management, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author, Ki Ling CheungKi Ling Cheungimcheung@ust.hkDepartment of Information and Systems Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong KongSearch for more papers by this author","Note\u2014Replenishment Sequencing in a Supply Chain with Balanced Ordering","This paper studies a supply chain with one supplier and multiple heterogeneous retailers where base-stock policies are practiced.

Motivated by a building-products retailer's practice of stocking large quantities of products to stimulate demand, we study inventory management and pricing policies when demand is uncertain but increases with stocking quantity. We first characterize the profit-maximization policy for a stochastic inventory model with a general inventory-dependent demand distribution and given price, and show that demand stimulation (by inventories) has the effect of increasing the target service level beyond the classical newsvendor model's critical fractile ratio. To underscore the importance of considering both demand stochasticity and inventory influence, we consider two functionally oriented benchmark policies\u2014a demand-driven policy and a critical fractile policy\u2014that might, respectively, represent marketing and inventory managers' viewpoints. Our numerical analysis reveals that the optimal policy can generate considerably higher profits than the two complementary functional perspectives. Moreover, we prove that the optimal stocking quantity always exceeds the critical fractile solution and can even exceed the demand-driven stocking quantity. We also address the problem of jointly optimizing both stocking quantity and price for demand-stimulating products using a multiplicative model to represent the influence of price and stocking quantity on the demand distribution. For this model, we show that the pricing and stocking decisions can be determined sequentially, with the optimal policy setting higher prices and stock levels than both the functional policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0171","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on inventory management and profit maximization without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For electronic products, life cycles are measured in units of months, with 6- to 12-month life cycles being common. Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0175","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory optimization without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the physical inventory level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of \u201cfreezing,\u201d in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular \u201czero balance walk\u201d audit policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0203","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and does not address any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

Our approach takes into account both interday (or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday (or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets.

Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more profitable for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0180","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['social welfare', 'consumer surplus', 'quality of service']","The article discusses social welfare and consumer surplus, indicating some consideration of broader societal impacts, but the primary focus remains on operational benefits and profitability.

The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved (but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: (1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; (2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and (3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0181","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic (myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price \u201cbetting\u201d strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0183","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

An alternative solution, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to use a math program (MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given set of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should an appropriate modification of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventory- and revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive lead time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0184","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory and revenue management without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

The firms play a two-stage game. First, each firm chooses whether to invest in mass customization, which would enable it to offer customized products that increasingly match each customer's ideal product as the chosen customization level increases. A firm that chooses not to invest in mass customization serves a standard product. Second, the firms competitively price their product lines. We characterize each firm's investment in mass customization and study its dependence on competitive position, as determined by its cost efficiency and perceived quality vis-\u00e0-vis its competitor. We find that the value of mass customization critically depends on the firm's competitive position. It may not be desirable even at zero cost due to its negative effect on price competition. A firm with an overall cost and quality disadvantage never unilaterally adopts mass customization. We show that allowing firms to set different prices for each product configuration leads to a broader adoption of mass customization compared to when they are restricted to uniform prices. However, a firm's chosen customization level may be higher with uniform prices. Our analysis also helps a customizing firm determine whether to target its process improvement efforts for a lower cost or a higher customization level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0185","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on market competition and mass customization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The basic research questions are whether the Nash equilibrium exists in this game, whether it is unique, and how the resulting inventories and prices are affected by competition. Using a novel method, we show the quasiconcavity of the competitive newsvendor's problem and establish the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Through a contraction mapping approach, we develop sufficient conditions for the Nash equilibrium to be unique. We then analyze the properties of the equilibrium and compare it with the optimal solution for the (noncompeting) price-sensitive newsvendor. We prove that at a symmetric equilibrium, retail prices and safety stocks strictly increase with the proportion of a newsvendor's unsatisfied customers that switch to a competitor, but strictly decrease with the intensity of price competition. Total inventories, on the other hand, increase with the intensity of price competition. Furthermore, the competitive equilibrium never has lower safety stocks and higher retail prices (a situation that definitely hurts the customers) than the solution for noncompetitive newsvendors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0186","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive pricing and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Most catalogers and online sellers, in addition to some traditional retailers, use upselling often to clear inventories of slow-moving items. We investigate the pricing and discounting questions for such an item, which we call the promotional product. In our model, an arriving customer may purchase this promotional product or one of the other products that the firm sells. If the customer purchases one of the other products, the promotional product is offered to the customer, possibly with a discount. While deciding whether to offer a discount and, if so, how big a discount to offer, the firm uses the information that the customer has just bought a certain product with a certain price. We investigate how discounting decisions depend on the inventory levels, time, type of pricing policy in use, and the relationship between the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product and the other products (negatively or positively correlated). In particular, we find that if the firm sets prices and discounts dynamically and the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are negatively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then customers are always offered a discount regardless of the inventory levels and time. On the other hand, if the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are positively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then the customer may or may not be offered a discount, depending on the inventory levels and time. Our numerical study shows that the benefit to the firm from using customer purchase information is high when the firm uses a static price, but chooses discounts dynamically. We also find that although dynamic discounting decisions bring modest improvements, setting the price dynamically seems to have a more significant effect on the firm's profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0187","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and discounting strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior.

In this context, the SLA is a commitment by a supplier to achieve a minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of SLA is an important, but understudied coordination mechanism. We focus on the impact of two contract parameters: the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, whereas lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer review periods are generally more effective than shorter review periods in inducing higher stocking levels. As in several earlier laboratory studies, the explanation lies in the improved feedback reliability that longer review periods provide. The primary managerial implication of our findings is that, in practice, longer review periods may be more effective than shorter ones at inducing service improvements.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0188","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service-level agreements and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For a decision process to be seen as fair, the people affected must have the opportunity to give input and possibly to influence the decision, and the decision process and rationale must be transparent and clear. Existing research has shown empirically that fair process enhances both employee motivation and performance in execution. However, work to date has not addressed why fair process is so often violated in practice. This paper breaks new ground by analytically examining the subtle trade-offs involved. We develop a model of fair process in a principal-agent (i.e., manager-employee) context, rooted in psychological preferences for autonomy and fairness.

We apply this framework to the classic newsvendor model and characterize the ordering decisions made by a boundedly rational decision maker. We identify systematic biases and offer insight into when overordering and underordering may occur. We also investigate the impact of these biases on several other inventory settings that have traditionally been studied using the newsvendor model as a building block, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling.

However, laboratory experiments show a \u201cpull-to-center\u201d effect: average order quantities are too low when they should be high and vice versa. We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is more likely to have been greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1080.0228","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of decision-making in a laboratory setting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast to previous literature which mainly considers solutions, such as law enforcement or technology protection that work on increasing individual piracy costs to alleviate the piracy problem, we consider using versioning as a potential instrument to fight piracy. We show that while a single version is the optimal strategy for an information goods provider absent piracy, the presence of piracy may lead firms to offer more than one quality, and versioning can be an effective and profitable instrument to fight piracy for digital information goods under some conditions. Our results indicate that the incentive to version is greater when the piracy cost is in a certain range. This strategic interaction between piracy cost and product line design has an interesting implication on optimal investment in piracy control. We also find that versioning can act as both a strategic substitute and a strategic complement to other instruments that increase consumer piracy costs.

We formulate the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for this model as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), in which each firm solves a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). The model assumes linear demand functions, quadratic generation cost functions, and a lossless DC network, resulting in equilibrium constraints as a parametric linear complementarity problem (LCP). We introduce an iterative procedure for solving this EPEC through repeated application of an MPEC algorithm. This MPEC algorithm is based on solving quadratic programming subproblems and on parametric LCP pivoting. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPEC and EPEC algorithms and the tractability of the model for realistic-size power systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0416","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of electricity markets without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such postponement strategies can be used by the retailer by delaying his operational decisions (order quantity and retail price) until after demand uncertainty is observed. We show how the equilibrium values of the contract parameters and profits are affected by (i) vertical competition, (ii) type of contract (wholesale price-only or buyback), (iii) demand distribution, (iv) form of the expected demand function, and (v) the timing of the retailer's operational decisions. Although in most cases postponement is quite beneficial for the channel members, we show that for some model parameters, due to vertical competition, the expected value of perfect information about demand for price postponement and order postponement may be negative for the channel and even, surprisingly, for both members. We also show that when a buyback option is offered, neither order postponement nor price postponement has an effect on the equilibrium wholesale price, profit allocation ratio between the manufacturer and the retailer, and channel efficiency, and that the equilibrium wholesale price, expected retail price, profit allocation ratio between the manufacturer and the retailer, and channel efficiency in the model with buyback options under either order or price postponement further coincide with their counterparts in the corresponding deterministic model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0430","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of a decentralized newsvendor model and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Management Sci.43 184\u2013189) to study a periodic-review inventory-control model where ordering cost is zero if the order quantity does not exceed a given contract volume and is linear in the excess quantity otherwise. This paper addresses the same problem but with a fixed cost if the order quantity is above the contract volume. The fixed cost may represent the cost of disruption for the supplier (finding more trucks, arranging extra processing capacity, persuading other customers to wait, etc.) as well as additional administrative costs. Also, suppliers may impose such costs simply to induce desired behavior by buyers. This order-cost function is neither convex nor concave. The classical inventory models with fixed costs are special cases with contract volume zero. We partially characterize the optimal policy for this system and develop a simple, effective heuristic policy. We also apply the model to a production-control problem in which an incentive is provided for not ordering over a certain quota.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0478","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and supply contracts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

They facilitate the derivation of multiplier values that reflect the reality of the problem situation under study. In measuring the operational efficiency of bank branches, for example, output multipliers would generally represent unit processing times for branch transactions such as deposits. AR restrictions on these multipliers are intended to ensure that the (multiplier) values assigned to the various outputs are relatively of the proper size. Current AR-DEA models presume that multiplier restrictions apply uniformly across all decision-making units (DMUs) in the analysis set. Such models can have severe shortcomings, however, in those situations where different circumstances prevail for some DMUs than for others. In the context of bank branches, for example, two sets of branches, whose transaction times are known to be different from each other, would generally require different sets of AR restrictions. This paper presents a methodology for incorporating multiple sets of AR restrictions, with each reflecting the context for a particular subset of DMUs.

In this paper, a new method for generating the efficient frontier for multiobjective problems is developed, called the diversity maximization approach (DMA). This approach is capable of solving mixed-integer and combinatorial problems. The DMA finds Pareto optimal solutions by maximizing a proposed diversity measure and guarantees generating the complete set of efficient points. Given a subset of the efficient frontier, DMA finds the next Pareto optimal solution which, combined with the existing ones, yields the most diversified subset of efficient points. This solution is defined as the most diverse solution. In fact, it aims to maximize the distance between the new efficient point and the closest point in the given subset of the efficient frontier. The proposed approach can be applied to any problem that can be solved for the single-objective case. We can use the DMA by solving directly a modified version of the mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of the multiobjective problem. In this case, the Pareto optimal solutions are found sequentially in an iterative way. Consequently, as we terminate the procedure before completion, a partial efficient frontier is available. The diversity measure assures that in every stage of the procedure, the partial efficient frontier is well diversified. This partial efficient frontier can be perceived as a filtered set of the complete efficient frontier and can be used by the decision maker in case the complete efficient frontier contains too many points.

The option value function for European and barrier options satisfies a partial integrodifferential equation (PIDE). This PIDE is commonly integrated in time by implicit-explicit (IMEX) time discretization schemes, where the differential (diffusion) term is treated implicitly, while the integral (jump) term is treated explicitly. In particular, the popular IMEX Euler scheme is first-order accurate in time. Second-order accuracy in time can be achieved by using the IMEX midpoint scheme. In contrast to the above approaches, we propose a new high-order time discretization scheme for the PIDE based on the extrapolation approach to the solution of ODEs that also treats the diffusion term implicitly and the jump term explicitly. The scheme is simple to implement, can be added to any PIDE solver based on the IMEX Euler scheme, and is remarkably fast and accurate. We demonstrate our approach on the examples of Merton's and Kou's jump-diffusion models, the diffusion-extended variance gamma model, as well as the two-dimensional Duffie-Pan-Singleton model with correlated and contemporaneous jumps in the stock price and its volatility. By way of example, pricing a one-year double-barrier option in Kou's jump-diffusion model, our scheme attains accuracy of 10\u22125 in 72 time steps (in 0.05 seconds). In contrast, it takes the first-order IMEX Euler scheme more than 1.3 million time steps (in 873 seconds) and the second-order IMEX midpoint scheme 768 time steps (in 0.49 seconds) to attain the same accuracy. Our scheme is also well suited for Bermudan options. Combining simplicity of implementation and remarkable gains in computational efficiency, we expect this method to be very attractive to financial engineering modelers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0419","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical computational method for financial modeling without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Yet, existing theoretical analysis of the optimal behavior of a trader subject to VaR limits has produced a negative view of VaR as a risk-control tool. In particular, VaR limits have been found to induce increased risk exposure in some states and an increased probability of extreme losses. However, these conclusions are based on models that are either static or dynamically inconsistent. In this paper, we formulate a dynamically consistent model of optimal portfolio choice subject to VaR limits and show that the concerns expressed in earlier papers do not apply if, consistently with common practice, the VaR limit is reevaluated dynamically. In particular, we find that the optimal risk exposure of a trader subject to a VaR limit is always lower than that of an unconstrained trader and that the probability of extreme losses is also lower. We also consider risk limits formulated in terms of tail conditional expectation (TCE), a coherent risk measure often advocated as an alternative to VaR, and show that in our dynamic setting it is always possible to transform a TCE limit into an equivalent VaR limit, and conversely.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0433","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management in trading without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we use sample-path analysis to express the steady-state probability of a one-sided regulated random walk to increase and be above a threshold, referred to as the last-come-first-serve (LCFS) backlog probability. We approximate the LCFS backlog probability under mild assumptions on the distribution of the random walk's steps and provide its exact expression when the steps are exponentially distributed, and a closed-form approximation when the steps are normally distributed. In our numerical experiments, the average relative gap between the approximated LCFS backlog probabilities and their simulated values is 5.13%. We further show that the LCFS backlog probability is an upper bound on the loss probability\u2014the probability that a two-sided regulated random walk is at a boundary. This bound is tighter than the backlog probability\u2014the probability that a random walk ever crosses a threshold\u2014that also bounds the loss probability. In an inventory application, we demonstrate that using the LCFS backlog probability rather than the backlog probability reduces the inventory level required to satisfy a service-level constraint on the percentage of orders backlogged.

The standard Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of the arc flow formulation leads to a set-partitioning problem as the master problem and an elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints as the pricing problem. We introduce the subset-row inequalities, which are Chvatal-Gomory rank-1 cuts based on a subset of the constraints in the master problem. Applying a subset-row inequality in the master problem increases the complexity of the label-setting algorithm used to solve the pricing problem because an additional resource is added for each inequality. We propose a modified dominance criterion that makes it possible to dominate more labels by exploiting the step-like structure of the objective function of the pricing problem. Computational experiments have been performed on the Solomon benchmarks where we were able to close several instances. The results show that applying subset-row inequalities in the master problem significantly improves the lower bound and, in many cases, makes it possible to prove optimality in the root node.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0449","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical algorithm for solving a specific optimization problem without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

For baskets of high-quality credits and for swaps that require multiple defaults to trigger payment, pricing the swap is a rare-event simulation problem. The Joshi-Kainth algorithm is an innovative importance-sampling technique for this problem that forces a predetermined number of defaults to occur on each path. This paper analyzes, extends, and improves the Joshi-Kainth algorithm. We show that, in its original form, the algorithm can actually increase variance; we present an alternative that is guaranteed to reduce variance, even when defaults are not rare.

In this paper, we propose tractable methods of addressing a general class of multistage stochastic optimization problems, which assume only limited information of the distributions of the underlying uncertainties, such as known mean, support, and covariance. One basic idea of our methods is to approximate the recourse decisions via decision rules. We first examine linear decision rules in detail and show that even for problems with complete recourse, linear decision rules can be inadequate and even lead to infeasible instances. Hence, we propose several new decision rules that improve upon linear decision rules, while keeping the approximate models computationally tractable. Specifically, our approximate models are in the forms of the so-called second-order cone (SOC) programs, which could be solved efficiently both in theory and in practice. We also present computational evidence indicating that our approach is a viable alternative, and possibly advantageous, to existing stochastic optimization solution techniques in solving a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with complete recourse.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0457","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each aircraft family contains multiple aircraft types having different capacities. Given a flight schedule network, the fleet assignment model is concerned with assigning aircraft to flight legs to maximize profits with respect to captured itinerary-based demand. However, because of related yield management and crew-scheduling regulations, in particular, this decision needs to be made well in advance of departures when market demand is still highly uncertain, although subsequently at a later stage, reassignments of aircraft types within a given family can be made when demand forecasts improve, while preserving crew schedules. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming approach in which the first stage makes only higher-level family-assignment decisions, while the second stage performs subsequent family-based type-level assignments according to forecasted market demand realizations. By considering demand uncertainty up-front at the initial fleeting stage, we inject additional flexibility in the process that offers more judicious opportunities for later revisions. We conduct a polyhedral analysis of the proposed model and develop suitable solution approaches.

A key feature of our model is that we allow transshipments to be triggered by both demand arrivals and production completions. Thus, transshipment is used to achieve production flexibility through inventory reallocation, as well as to fill emergency demands. We also consider capacity issues in transshipment by modeling each location as a single-server, make-to-stock queueing system. In this setting, we prove that the optimal production policy for each location belongs to the \u201chedging point\u201d family of policies, while the optimal demand filling policy belongs to the \u201cstate-dependent rationing\u201d family of policies.

We consider an inventory whose content fluctuates as a Brownian motion in the absence of control. At any moment, a controller can adjust the inventory level by any positive or negative quantity, but incurs both a fixed cost and a cost proportional to the magnitude of the adjustment. The inventory level must be nonnegative at all times and continuously incurs a linear holding cost. The objective is to minimize long-run average cost. We show that control band policies are optimal for the average cost Brownian control problem and explicitly calculate the parameters of the optimal control band policy. This form of policy is described by three parameters {q,Q,S}, 0 < q \u2264 Q < S. When the inventory falls to zero (rises to S), the controller expedites (curtails) shipments to return it to q (Q). Employing apparently new techniques based on methods of Lagrangian relaxation, we show that this type of policy is optimal even with constraints on the size of adjustments and on the maximum inventory level.

For example, in a number of application domains including homeland security, environmental monitoring, and surveillance for military operations, a network's ability to efficiently manage power consumption is extremely critical because direct user intervention after initial deployment is severely limited. In these settings, limited battery life gives rise to the basic coordination problem of maintaining coverage while maximizing the network's lifetime. In this paper, we propose a distributed scheme for efficient power management in sensor networks that is guaranteed to identify suboptimal topologies in an online fashion. Our scheme is based on a general (game-theoretic) mathematical structure that induces a natural mapping between the informational layer and the physical layer. We provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of the algorithm to a pure Nash equilibrium and characterize the performance of the algorithm in terms of coverage. We also present encouraging performance results on a MicaZ testbed as well as on large-scale topologies (obtained via simulation).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0435","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of power management in sensor networks without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The deadline creates an incentive to start early with production. However, opportunities to gather information that might change production decisions provide an incentive to defer the start of production. We study the resultant dynamic decision problem with alternatives that commit to one of several courses of action now and an alternative to defer the commitment to gather more information about the possible consequences of each alternative. The deadline increases the effective cost of gathering information because that cost includes the value sacrificed by reducing the time available to produce inventory. We frame our model using the annual influenza vaccine composition decision: deciding between strains of the virus to include, which must happen in the spring to allow time for vaccine production before the fall flu season begins. Our analysis describes the optimal decision strategies for this commit-or-defer decision. Many insights are drawn from this model that could contribute to more informed flu vaccine composition decisions.

The underlying system is a Markov decision process, where the state of the system can only be observed by the agent but the agent's action is observed by both parties. This paper develops a dynamic programming algorithm to derive optimal long-term contracts for the principal. The principal indirectly controls the underlying system by offering the agent a menu of continuation utility vectors along public information paths; the agent's best response, expressed in his choice of continuation utilities, induces truthful state revelation and results in actions that maximize the principal's expected payoff.

By examining parameter sensitivity, insight is provided on how the algorithms can be used by the shipper for making procurement decisions.

We study the equilibrium behaviour when firms differ, both with regard to their costs and their capacities. We characterize strong equilibrium solutions in which, given the other players' supply functions, optimal profits are achieved for every demand realisation. If the demand can be low enough for it to be met economically with supply from just one firm, then the supply function equilibria are ordered in a natural way. We consider equilibria in which, for the highest levels of demand, all but one of the firms have reached their capacity limit. We show that there can be at most one supply function equilibrium with this property. We also propose a new numerical method to find asymmetric supply function equilibria, using piecewise-linear approximations and a discretization of the demand distribution.

In particular, we are interested in performance measures such as the probability that the portfolio incurs large losses over a fixed time horizon, and the expected excess loss given that large losses are incurred during this horizon. Contrary to the normal copula that is commonly used in practice (e.g., in the CreditMetrics system), we assume a portfolio dependence structure that is semiparametric, does not hinge solely on correlation, and supports extremal dependence among obligors. A particular instance within the proposed class of models is the so-called t-copula model that is derived from the multivariate Student t distribution and hence generalizes the normal copula model. The size of the portfolio, the heterogeneous mix of obligors, and the fact that default events are rare and mutually dependent make it quite complicated to calculate portfolio credit risk either by means of exact analysis or na\u00efve Monte Carlo simulation. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. We first derive sharp asymptotics for portfolio credit risk that illustrate the implications of extremal dependence among obligors. Using this as a stepping stone, we develop importance-sampling algorithms that are shown to be asymptotically optimal and can be used to efficiently compute portfolio credit risk via Monte Carlo simulation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0513","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio credit risk and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

This approximation greatly enhances our ability to analyze the interdependent inventory/service, price, and product assortment decisions in noncompetitive and competitive scenarios with demand substitution. We demonstrate that the approximation is well behaved and then apply it to two previously intractable applications. First, we study a price and service competition between single-product retailers. After establishing a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we find that competition results in lower price, higher demand, and a higher level of inventory. We also observe that the aggregate profit and inventory level increase to positive constants as the number of retailers goes to infinity. Second, we study a duopolistic competition on price, service, and product assortment. We establish a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for the product assortment competition and identify a condition for uniqueness. We find that competition on both price and product assortment results in lower price and less variety for each competitor, but the total number of products and the aggregate inventory level in a duopoly market are both likely to be higher than in a monopolistic market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0541","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand substitution and competitive market analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the latter case, capacity is assembled over time from components and may be used to manufacture many products. In the spirit of Rosling, we provide conditions under which it can be solved by an equivalent analogous serial model in the form developed by Clark and Scarf in 1960, with a separate state variable for the level of assets in each stage of completion, dramatically simplifying the problem and its solution. In the liquid-asset case, we extend Rosling's 1989 work by including nonstationary demands, costs, and revenues in a finite-horizon setting. In the fixed-asset (capacity) expansion case, we show that capacity should be assembled in a balanced way and derive the optimal timing and extent of delays (in previously initiated capacity expansions). Our basic capacity expansion model is deterministic, so under our conditions, it is optimal never to delay a schedule and the state space reduces to a single dimension. However, in the Markov-modulated case, in which cost parameters and customer demand distributions can be influenced by a randomly and exogenously evolving state (of the economy), we illustrate that delays can be optimal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0543","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in asset assembly without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

In particular, we characterize a multiperiod contract form, the promised lead-time contract, that reduces the supplier's risk from demand uncertainty and the retailer's risk from uncertain inventory availability. Under the contract terms, the supplier guarantees on-time delivery of complete orders of any size after the promised lead time. We characterize the optimal promised lead time and the corresponding payments that the supplier should offer to minimize her expected inventory cost, while ensuring the retailer's participation. In such a supply chain, the retailer often holds private information about his shortage cost (or his service level to end customers). Hence, to understand the impact of the promised lead-time contract on the supplier's and the retailer's performance, we study the system under local control with full information and local control with asymmetric information. By comparing the results under these information scenarios to those under a centrally controlled system, we provide insights into stock positioning and inventory risk sharing. We quantify, for example, how much and when the supplier and the retailer overinvest in inventory as compared to the centrally controlled supply chain. We show that the supplier faces more inventory risk when the retailer has private service-level information. We also show that a supplier located closer to the retailer is affected less by information asymmetry. Next, we characterize when the supplier should optimally choose not to sign a promised lead-time contract and consider doing business under other settings. In particular, we establish the optimality of a cutoff level policy. Finally, under both full and asymmetric service-level information, we characterize conditions when optimal promised lead times take extreme values of the feasible set, yielding the supplier to assume all or none of the inventory risk\u2014hence the name all-or-nothing solution. We conclude with numerical examples demonstrating our results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0514","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory risk without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Capacity uncertainty (e.g., due to downtime, quality problems, yield, etc.) is a common feature of many production systems, but its effects have not been explored in the context of a firm that has multiple production facilities. We first characterize the optimal production and transshipment policies and show that uncertain capacity leads the firm to ration the inventory that is available for transshipment to the other location and characterize the structure of this rationing policy. Then, we characterize the optimal production policies at both locations, which are defined by state-dependent produce-up-to thresholds. We also describe sensitivity of the optimal production and transshipment policies to problem parameters and, in particular, explain how uncertain capacity can lead to counterintuitive behavior, such as produce-up-to limits decreasing for locations that face stochastically higher demand.

The algorithm solves directly a problem equivalent to the minimum-cut problem\u2014the maximum blocking-cut problem. Once the maximum blocking-cut solution is available, the additional complexity required to find the respective maximum-flow is O(m log n). A variant of the algorithm is a new parametric maximum-flow algorithm generating all breakpoints in the same complexity required to solve the constant capacities maximum-flow problem. The pseudoflow algorithm has also a simplex variant, pseudoflow-simplex, that can be implemented to solve the maximum-flow problem. One feature of the pseudoflow algorithm is that it can initialize with any pseudoflow. This feature allows it to reach an optimal solution quickly when the initial pseudoflow is \u201cclose\u201d to an optimal solution. The complexities of the pseudoflow algorithm, the pseudoflow-simplex, and the parametric variants of pseudoflow and pseudoflow-simplex algorithms are all O(mn log n) on a graph with n nodes and m arcs. Therefore, the pseudoflow-simplex algorithm is the fastest simplex algorithm known for the parametric maximum-flow problem.

We give separate treatments to the case where the firms compete in terms of (i) prices (only), (ii) their service level or waiting-time standard (only), and (iii) simultaneously in terms of both prices and service levels.

The correlations across asset classes, of bonds, stocks, cash, and other financial instruments, are state dependent using multiple correlation matrices that correspond to differing market conditions.

We consider the case of an additive separable utility function with nonnegative, nonincreasing attribute weights. In this case, cumulative dominance ensures that the so-called cumulative dominance compliant heuristics will choose a best alternative. For the case of binary attribute values and under two probabilistic models of the decision environment generalizing a simple Bernoulli model, we obtain the probabilities of simple and cumulative dominance. In contrast with the probability of simple dominance, the probability of cumulative dominance is shown to be large in many cases, explaining the effectiveness of cumulative dominance compliant heuristics in those cases. Additionally, for the subclass of the so-called fully cumulative dominance compliant heuristics, we obtain an upper bound for the expected loss that only depends on the weights being nonnegative and nonincreasing. The low values of the upper bound for cases in which the probability of cumulative dominance is not large provide an additional explanation for the effectiveness of fully cumulative dominance compliant heuristics. Examples of cumulative dominance compliant heuristics and fully cumulative dominance compliant heuristics are discussed, including the deterministic elimination by aspects (DEBA) heuristic that motivated our work.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0485","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making heuristics without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Cross efficiency links one decision-making unit's (DMU) performance with others and has the appeal that scores arise from peer evaluation. However, a number of the current cross-efficiency approaches are flawed because they use scores that are arbitrary in that they depend on a particular set of optimal DEA weights generated by the computer code in use at the time. One set of optimal DEA weights (possibly out of many alternate optima) may improve the cross efficiency of some DMUs, but at the expense of others. While models have been developed that incorporate secondary goals aimed at being more selective in the choice of optimal multipliers, the alternate optima issue remains. In cases where there is competition among DMUs, this situation may be seen as undesirable and unfair. To address this issue, this paper generalizes the original DEA cross-efficiency concept to game cross efficiency. Specifically, each DMU is viewed as a player that seeks to maximize its own efficiency, under the condition that the cross efficiency of each of the other DMUs does not deteriorate. The average game cross-efficiency score is obtained when the DMU's own maximized efficiency scores are averaged. To implement the DEA game cross-efficiency model, an algorithm for deriving the best (game cross-efficiency) scores is presented. We show that the optimal game cross-efficiency scores constitute a Nash equilibrium point.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0487","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['fair', 'unfair', 'efficiency']","The article discusses fairness in the context of performance evaluation among decision-making units, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of efficiency models rather than social justice or equity themes.

Products from a supplier have one release time and are consolidated into a single shipment to the consolidation center. At the center, products to the same destination are also consolidated into a single shipment, and the consolidation time can be as early as possible or as late as possible, depending on the customer requirement and cost structure. The 3PL needs to determine the pickup times from the suppliers, delivery times to the customers, and the transportation options while considering product release times, latest arrival times, different consolidation policies, and the transportation and storage costs involved. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a nonlinear optimization problem, show it is an NP-hard problem, and develop a dual-based solution method for the general problem. Utilizing the problem's special structure, we show that the Lagrangian dual of the general problem can be solved optimally as a linear program, thus allowing us to accelerate the computation of a lower bound to the optimal objective function value. The experimental results show that the dual-based algorithm provides solutions with objective function values, which are on average within 3.24% of optimality. We also consider a version of the problem where each customer orders products from all suppliers, for which we develop a polynomial-time algorithm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0488","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of logistics and optimization without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Customer orders for various products must be filled within the product-specific target lead time, or become lost sales. A product can be assembled instantaneously if its required components are in stock at the assembly facility. The production facility for each component is geographically distant from the assembly facility, and the transportation lead time is deterministic. Each shipment of components incurs a fixed cost and a variable cost per unit. The system manager must initially commit to the production capacity for each component. Then, in response to customer orders, he must dynamically manage production (expediting and salvaging) and shipping for each component, and the sequence of customer orders for assembly (how scarce components are allocated to outstanding orders). The objective is to minimize expected discounted costs for lost sales, production, and shipping. This discounted formulation accounts for financial inventory holding costs but not physical inventory holding costs. The main result is that as the order arrival rate for each product becomes large and the discount rate becomes small, a simple threshold policy with independent control of each component is asymptotically optimal. The policy is parameterized by five numbers for each component. Expressions for these parameters, the expected discounted cost, and the long-run average rates of salvaging and expediting are obtained by solving an approximating Brownian control problem. In a numerical example from the computer industry, the Brownian approximation is remarkably accurate.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0497","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management, specifically optimizing production and shipping processes, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we generalize the two most commonly used parametric families of scoring rules and demonstrate their relation to well-known generalized entropies and utility functions, shedding new light on the characteristics of alternative scoring rules as well as duality relationships between utility maximization and entropy minimization. In particular, we show that weighted forms of the pseudospherical and power scoring rules correspond exactly to measures of relative entropy (divergence) with convenient properties, and they also correspond exactly to the solutions of expected utility maximization problems in which a risk-averse decision maker whose utility function belongs to the linear-risk-tolerance family interacts with a risk-neutral betting opponent or a complete market for contingent claims in either a one-period or a two-period setting. When the market is incomplete, the corresponding problems of maximizing linear-risk-tolerance utility with the risk-tolerance coefficient \u03b2 are the duals of the problems of minimizing the pseudospherical or power divergence of order \u03b2 between the decision maker's subjective probability distribution and the set of risk-neutral distributions that support asset prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0498","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scoring rules and utility maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

A typical timeshare owner has purchased yearly access to a specific week at a specific resort. The resulting lack of vacation variety is mitigated by systems that allow owners to exchange owned weeks for different weeks at different resorts according to their preferences, the assessed value of what they are exchanging, their contractual priority, and resort availability. The timeshare exchange problem is similar to other preference-based assignment problems such as labor scheduling, preferential bidding, and traditional timetabling, but different in the formulation of the objective function. This paper demonstrates how the effectiveness of timeshare exchange processes can be improved through mathematical optimization, as measured by increased satisfaction of participant preferences. Optimization also presents exchange managers with the opportunity to more precisely manage preference and priority trade-offs among various classes of participants.

Portfolio credit risk is measured through probabilities of large losses, which are typically due to defaults of many obligors (sources of credit risk) to which a portfolio is exposed. An essential element of a portfolio view of credit risk is a model of dependence between these sources of credit risk: large losses occur rarely and are most likely to result from systematic risk factors that affect multiple obligors. As a consequence, estimating portfolio credit risk poses a challenge both because of the rare-event property of large losses and the dependence between defaults. To address this problem, we develop an importance sampling technique within the widely used Gaussian copula model of dependence. We focus on difficulties arising in multifactor models\u2014that is, models in which multiple factors may be common to multiple obligors, resulting in complex dependence between defaults. Our importance sampling procedure shifts the mean of the common factor to increase the frequency of large losses. In multifactor models, different combinations of factor outcomes and defaults can produce large losses, so our method combines multiple importance sampling distributions, each associated with a shift in the mean of common factors. We characterize \u201coptimal\u201d mean shifts. Finding these points is both a combinatorial problem and a convex optimization problem, so we address computational aspects of this step as well.

While traditional risk-neutral revenue management models offer optimal strategies in the long run, they are exposed to the variation of revenue flows. If a short-term revenue target is a primary concern for the supplier, the risk-neutral assumption fails to provide the best policy needed. The proposed model uses an exponential function with a risk-sensitive parameter instead of the conventional risk-neutral objective. The risk parameter measures how the supplier is sensitive to the deviation of revenues. We show that the new objective function captures the supplier's risk behavior. We develop a recursive procedure for the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal policy has attractive properties such as nested active price set, monotonicity with respect to the remaining time and inventory, and threshold-type control. When the supplier is more sensitive to the uncertain revenue flows, the risk-sensitive model leads to more conservative pricing policies.

As part of our computational approach, we propose a novel scheme to account for backlogging costs in a capacitated, multiperiod environment. Our cost-accounting scheme, called the forced marginal backlogging cost-accounting scheme, is significantly different from the period-by-period accounting approach to backlogging costs used in dynamic programming; it captures the long-term impact of a decision on system performance in the presence of capacity constraints. In the likely event that the per-unit order costs are large compared to the holding and backlogging costs, a transformation of cost parameters yields a significantly improved guarantee. We also introduce new semimyopic policies based on our new cost-accounting scheme to derive bounds on the optimal base-stock levels. We show that these bounds can be used to effectively improve any policy.

For lung and liver tumors, the presence of breathing motion during treatment is a challenge to the effective and reliable delivery of the radiation. In this paper, we build a model of motion uncertainty using probability density functions that describe breathing motion, and provide a robust formulation of the problem of optimizing intensity-modulated radiation therapy. We populate our model with real patient data and measure the robustness of the resulting solutions on a clinical lung example. Our robust framework generalizes current mathematical programming formulations that account for motion, and gives insight into the trade-off between sparing the healthy tissues and ensuring that the tumor receives sufficient dose. For comparison, we also compute solutions to a nominal (no uncertainty) and margin (worst-case) formulation. In our experiments, we found that the nominal solution typically underdosed the tumor in the unacceptable range of 6% to 11%, whereas the robust solution underdosed by only 1% to 2% in the worst case. In addition, the robust solution reduced the total dose delivered to the main organ-at-risk (the left lung) by roughly 11% on average, as compared to the margin solution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1070.0484","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of radiation therapy and does not address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Differences include a nonlinear value of sales (caused by the nonlinear health benefits of vaccination that are due to infection dynamics) and vaccine production yield issues. We show that production risks, taken currently by the vaccine manufacturer, lead to an insufficient supply of vaccine. Several supply contracts that coordinate buyer (governmental public health service) and supplier (vaccine manufacturer) incentives in many other industrial supply chains cannot fully coordinate the influenza vaccine supply chain.

Recently, this has happened with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB). We develop two variants of a co-epidemic model of two diseases. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R0), the disease-free equilibrium, and the quasi-disease-free equilibria, which we define as the existence of one disease along with the complete eradication of the other disease, and the co-infection equilibria for specific conditions. We determine stability criteria for the disease-free and quasi-disease-free equilibria. We present an illustrative numerical analysis of the HIV-TB co-epidemics in India that we use to explore the effects of hypothetical prevention and treatment scenarios. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that exclusively treating HIV or TB may reduce the targeted epidemic, but can subsequently exacerbate the other epidemic. Our analyses suggest that coordinated treatment efforts that include highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV, latent TB prophylaxis, and active TB treatment may be necessary to slow the HIV-TB co-epidemic. However, treatment alone may not be sufficient to eradicate both diseases. Increased disease prevention efforts (for example, those that promote condom use) may also be needed to extinguish this co-epidemic. Our simple model of two synergistic infectious disease epidemics illustrates the importance of including the effects of each disease on the transmission and progression of the other disease.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0571","","OR","Multidisciplinary","4","['co-epidemic', 'HIV', 'treatment', 'prevention', 'public health']","The article discusses the interconnectedness of HIV and tuberculosis, emphasizing the need for coordinated treatment and prevention efforts.

These dynamical profiles were put in SFM, which is an optimization model that maximizes classification accuracy by selecting electrodes (features) that correctly classify unlabeled EEG samples based on the nearest-neighbor classification rule. The empirical studies were performed on the EEG data sets collected from 10 subjects. The performance of SFM was assessed and compared with the ones achieved by the traditional k-nearest-neighbor classifier and support vector machines (SVMs).

We use principal-agent models to formulate the licensor's contracting problem, and we find that under adverse selection, the optimal contract structure changes with the licensee's valuation of the innovation. As the licensee's valuation increases, the licensor's optimal level of involvement in the development\u2014directly or through royalties\u2014should decrease. Only a risk-averse licensor should include both up-front and milestone payments.

However, the United States Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule is becoming increasingly complex as it is expanded to cover additional diseases. Moreover, biotechnology advances have allowed vaccine manufacturers to create combination vaccines that immunize against several diseases in a single injection. All these factors are creating a combinatorial explosion of alternatives and choices (each with a different cost) for public health policy makers, pediatricians, and parents/guardians (each with a different perspective). The General Vaccine Formulary Selection Problem (GVFSP) is introduced to model general childhood immunization schedules that can be used to illuminate these alternatives and choices by selecting a vaccine formulary that minimizes the cost of fully immunizing a child and the amount of extraimmunization. Both exact algorithms and heuristics for GVFSP are presented. A computational comparison of these algorithms and heuristics is presented for the 2006 Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule, as well as several randomly generated childhood immunization schedules that are likely to be representative of future childhood immunization schedules. The results reported here provide both fundamental insights into the structure of the GVFSP models and algorithms and practical value for the public health community.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0612","","OR","Multidisciplinary","2","['public health', 'immunization', 'policy makers']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of vaccine formulary selection and cost minimization without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Currently, little is known about the relationship between the timing of dialysis initiation and the therapy's cost and effectiveness. This paper examines the cost-effective initiation of dialysis and compares standard initiation criteria from the clinical literature to computationally derived strategies. Comparisons make use of a simulation model that integrates submodels of disease progression, hospitalization, transplantation, cost, and quality of life. The simulation model is also used by an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to derive approximately optimal strategies that maximize patient welfare. Patient welfare is measured from the society's perspective and is defined as the product of the expected discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a \u201cvalue-of-life\u201d parameter, minus the expected total discounted medical expenditures. Also considered is an alternative formulation in which the goal is to minimize the expected total discounted medical expenditures without affecting patient QALYs relative to current medical practice. Numerical results show that: (i) standard early initiation strategies, where once started on dialysis patients are kept on a fixed weekly program, have a limited potential, and (ii) early dialysis at an incrementally increasing dose customized to each patient can yield a significant cost advantage. These findings demonstrate computationally intensive models of disease progression, and therapy effectiveness can identify novel strategies for managing expensive medical therapies and a more efficient use of scarce health-care resources.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0613","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['patient welfare', 'quality of life', 'cost-effective']","The article discusses patient welfare and quality of life, which indicate a consideration of ethical implications in healthcare management.

Due to privacy concerns, the details of the composition of this waiting list are not publicly available. This paper considers the benefits associated with creating a more transparent waiting list. We study these benefits by modeling the organ accept/reject decision faced by these patients as a Markov decision process in which the state of the process is described by patient health, quality of the offered liver, and a measure of the rank of the patient in the waiting list. We prove conditions under which there exist structured optimal solutions, such as monotone value functions and control-limit optimal policies. We define the concept of the patient's price of privacy, namely, the number of expected life days lost due to the lack of complete waiting list information. We conduct extensive numerical studies based on clinical data, which indicate that this price of privacy is typically on the order of 5% of the optimal solution value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1080.0648","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['privacy', 'transparency', 'patient', 'waiting list']","The article discusses the implications of privacy and transparency in the context of liver transplantation, highlighting ethical considerations around patient information.

A Tentative Model and Examination","Asubstantive body of theory and research on the role of culture in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) suggests that cultural differences can create major obstacles to achieving integration benefits. However, the opposite view\u2014that differences in culture between merging firms can be a source of value creation and learning\u2014has also been advanced and empirically supported. In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting perspectives and findings, we present a model that synthesizes our current understanding of the role of culture in M&A, and we develop a set of hypotheses regarding mechanisms through which cultural differences affect M&A performance. The results of a meta-analysis of 46 studies, with a combined sample size of 10,710 M&A, suggest that cultural differences affect sociocultural integration, synergy realization, and shareholder value in different, and sometimes opposing, ways.

Some scholars argue that corporate philanthropy facilitates stakeholder cooperation and helps secure access to critical resources controlled by those stakeholders, suggesting that corporate philanthropy should be positively associated with corporate financial performance. In contrast, other scholars take a negative stance, suggesting that corporate philanthropy diverts valuable corporate resources and tends to inhibit corporate financial performance. Existing empirical studies have not found conclusive evidence on the corporate philanthropy\u2013financial performance relationship. Integrating and extending existing perspectives, this study develops the argument that the relationship between corporate philanthropy and financial performance is best captured by an inverse U-shape.

We propose a theory of how individuals, including those who are structurally highly embedded, can become change agents when confronted with amplified institutional contradictions. Using the empirical example of family presence in the leadership of Taiwanese business groups, we argue that despite the structural constraints on second-generation key leaders, these leaders are more likely to actualize their motivation to reduce family presence in the contexts of market-oriented transition and highly diversified business groups, and that key leaders with a management education from the United States are more likely to deviate from this institutionalized practice than are non-U.S.-educated key leaders, because they can transport ideas from different business models. A longitudinal analysis of the top 100 business groups in Taiwan between 1977 and 1998 largely supports our arguments.

Our review of the literature identified two distinct explanations: Trust emerges from either a shadow of the past (i.e., prior history) or a shadow of the future (i.e., expectations of continuity). In this paper we develop and empirically examine a third perspective: The potential interdependence of these two explanations. Our results strongly endorse this third perspective. We find that prior history does not directly affect trust; instead, the observed positive relationship between the two is mediated by expectations of continuity. Consistent with this result, analyses further show that a longer prior history makes the effect of continuity on trust much stronger than a shorter prior history. We interpret these findings as suggesting: (1) the criticality and centrality of a shadow of the future (i.e., a forward-looking calculus) in generating trust in interorganizational exchanges and (2) that a shadow of the past plays a facilitating, albeit indirect, role in trust building. Our conceptual model also extends the conventional use of the transaction cost logic to show how reciprocal investments in asset specificity and uncertainty drive expectations of continuity, and consequently, interorganizational trust. Our results also show, unexpectedly, that prior history has a direct negative effect on trust after specifying the mediating path of continuity. Our moderation analysis indicates when this effect occurs: When weak expectations of continuity exist, trust is lower for exchanges characterized by a longer prior history, suggesting a potential darkside of overembedded ties.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0281","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'interdependence', 'expectations']","The article discusses trust in interorganizational contexts, focusing on the interdependence of past and future expectations.

Using 48 months of turnover data from U.S. stores of a major retail chain, we find that, on average, employee turnover is associated with decreased performance, as measured by profit margin and customer service. The effect of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of management on which we focus is process conformance\u2014the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores, managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores, managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We find that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover is pronounced. Our results suggest that, in settings where performance depends on the repetition of known tasks, managers can reduce turnover's effect by imposing process discipline through standard operating procedures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0294","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['employee turnover', 'performance', 'management']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of employee turnover and its impact on performance metrics like profit margin and customer service, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we examine participation in university technology transfer, a new organizational initiative, by tracking 1,780 faculty members, examining their backgrounds and work environments, and following their engagement with academic entrepreneurship. We find that individual adoption of the new initiative may be either substantive or symbolic. Our results suggest that individual attributes, while important, are conditioned by the local work environment. In terms of personal attributes, individuals are more likely to participate if they trained at institutions that had accepted the new initiative and been active in technology transfer. In addition, we find that the longer the time that had elapsed since graduate training, the less likely the individual was to actively embrace the new commercialization norm. Considering the localized social environment, we find that when the chair of the department is active in technology transfer, other members of the department are also likely to participate, if only for symbolic reasons. We also find that technology transfer behavior is calibrated by the experience of those in the relevant cohort. If an individual can observe others with whom they identify engaging in the new initiative, then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance. Finally, when individuals face dissonance, a situation where their individual training norms are not congruent with the localized social norms in their work environment, they will conform to the local norms, rather than adhering to the norms from their prior experience.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0295","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['organizational change', 'social learning', 'local work environment', 'technology transfer']","The article discusses themes of organizational change and social learning within academic contexts, indicating an awareness of the social dynamics at play in technology transfer.

While these initiatives are typically undertaken in the quest for improved firm performance and competitiveness, empirical research to date has been equivocal in supporting the efficacy of these initiatives. In addition, extant research has not thoroughly examined factors or conditions that may influence or moderate the performance impact of workforce downsizing. In this paper, we address the question: Do industry conditions moderate the impact of workforce downsizing on firm performance? We examine this question using matched primary and secondary data on a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms. After controlling for a set of industry and firm-level variables, including firms' prior performance levels, our results indicate that downsizing is associated with decreases in subsequent firm profitability and that these negative effects are more pronounced in industries characterized by research and development (R&D) intensity, growth, and low capital intensity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0298","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['downsizing', 'firm performance', 'employee layoffs']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of workforce downsizing and its impact on firm performance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show how initial conditions constrain subsequent outcomes by demonstrating that the founding team's prior functional experiences and initial organizational functional structures predict subsequent top manager backgrounds and later functional structures. We find that narrowly experienced teams have trouble adding functional expertise not already embodied in the team. We also find that firms beginning with a limited range of functional positions are less likely to develop complete functional structures. Importantly, we do not find functional structure and functional experience to be interchangeable. We find that firms beginning with more complete functional structures are likely to go public faster, and firms beginning with broadly experienced team members obtain venture capital more quickly regardless of the experience and structural composition of the top management team in place at the time of these outcomes. Further, broadly experienced founding teams that build an early team with a full complement of functional positions achieve important milestones faster than firms that start with neither experience nor structure. This suggests that creating positions as \u201cplaceholders\u201d in new ventures, where positions are created and filled with the intent of bringing individuals with more relevant experience onboard later, is not obviously a path by which to succeed.

For this purpose, we adopt a critical discursive perspective that allows us to discover how specific conceptions of strategy work are reproduced and legitimized in organizational strategizing. Our empirical analysis is based on an extensive research project on strategy work in 12 organizations. As a result of our analysis, we identify three central discourses that seem to be systematically associated with nonparticipatory approaches to strategy work: \u201cmystification,\u201d \u201cdisciplining,\u201d and \u201ctechnologization.\u201d However, we also distinguish three strategy discourses that promote participation: \u201cself-actualization,\u201d \u201cdialogization,\u201d and \u201cconcretization.\u201d Our analysis shows that strategy as practice involves alternative and even competing discourses that have fundamentally different kinds of implications for participation in strategy work.

Being female was correlated with perceived retaliation. Results of structural equation modeling showed significant gender differences in antecedents and outcomes of retaliation. For men, lack of support from others and low whistleblower's power were significantly related to retaliation; for women, lack of support from others, serious wrongdoing, and the wrongdoing's direct effect on the whistleblower were significantly associated with retaliation.

I propose a model with two vertical segments (upstream and downstream), firm populations with heterogeneous capabilities, and an intermediate market subject to transaction costs in which firms can choose whether to be integrated or vertically specialized. By varying the level of transaction costs and changing the structure of the correlation between upstream and downstream capabilities in the industry, learning curves, and the way in which profitability leads to capability improvement in the upstream and downstream segments, I generate numerical results to explain how vertical integration evolves over time. The results suggest that (a) with no capability differences, even if transaction costs are nil, firms remain integrated; (b) transaction costs catalyze the underlying capability differences to drive scope; (c) dynamic factors, such as learning curves, returns to investment in capabilities, or limits to expansion, exacerbate small, random capability differences and as such promote specialization. These dynamic factors can by themselves lead to substantial specialization when they differ between the upstream and downstream segments. The model also provides a rationale for mixed governance (i.e., concurrent use of both the market and integration), as well as for the initial period of vertical integration, followed by specialization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0312","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of vertical integration and transaction costs without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As expected from previous literature, when facing a problem requiring inputs from others, an individual will draw on her personal or ego-centered network using the knowledge of her network's TMS; however, we theorize that the mixed motives within her network will cause the individual to also take into account her perception of the level of distrust within the network when combining the received knowledge from others in the network. Moreover, an individual's view of her network's TMS will be shaped not by specific policies or enforcement mechanisms, but by semistructures for how knowledge is disseminated, owned, and discussed. Our theory is supported based on a survey of security professionals responding to national security threats.

This phenomenon of \u201cprocess virtualization\u201d is happening in many contexts, including formal education (via distance learning), shopping (via electronic commerce), and friendship development (via social networking sites and virtual worlds). However, some processes are more amenable to virtualization than others. For example, distance learning seems to work better for some educational processes than others, and electronic commerce has worked well for some shopping processes but not for others. These observations motivate the central question posed in this paper: What factors affect the \u201cvirtualizability\u201d of a process? This question is becoming increasingly important as advances in information technology create the potential for society to virtualize more and more processes. To provide a general theoretical basis for investigating this question, this paper proposes \u201cprocess virtualization theory,\u201d which includes four main constructs (sensory requirements, relationship requirements, synchronism requirements, and identification and control requirements) that affect whether a process is amenable or resistant to being conducted virtually. Recognizing that processes can be virtualized with or without the use of information technology, this paper makes explicit the theoretical significance of information technology in process virtualization by discussing the moderating effects of representation, reach, and monitoring capability. This helps explain how advances in information technology are enabling a new generation of virtual processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0316","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['virtualization', 'information technology', 'process']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of process virtualization and the role of information technology, with no explicit mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Building off the Behavioral Agency Model, Agency Theory, and Prospect Theory, we develop arguments about when equity-based compensation elements will increase or decrease executive risk propensity and, in turn, strategic risk taking. Incorporating a behavioral perspective into our models of incentive alignment provides us with new and potentially more accurate predictions about how individual elements of CEO pay will influence risk selection, as well as how equity compensation interacts with cash compensation and with other factors to influence risk preferences. In general, this study provides evidence that CEO equity-based compensation significantly influences strategic risk, but that this influence is more nuanced and complex than conventional treatments of executive compensation assume. In particular, we find that different forms of equity-based pay exhibit dissimilar influences on strategic risk and that their influence changes as their value and vesting status change. Second, we find that cash-based forms of pay moderate the incentive properties of equity-based pay, indicating that cash-based pay may affect how executives perceive risks associated with equity pay. Finally, we find that stock price volatility and board actions each also moderate the incentive effects of equity-based pay. In sum, our results argue for increased recognition of a behavioral perspective on executive compensation and greater precision in how we measure and model the incentive alignment properties of CEO compensation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0317","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['CEO compensation', 'risk', 'behavioral perspective']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of CEO compensation and its influence on firm risk, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

In this study we argue that emergence of a new form, which is ultimately based on validation by external audiences, depends on two mechanisms: identity framing, i.e., how audiences perceive and frame the identity of an emerging organizational domain, and identity matching, i.e., the match between the identity of the domain and the identity of candidates. Accordingly, form emergence is best characterized as contextual rather than as an inherent attribute of the categories of candidate organizations. Using data on the U.S. commercial television industry from 1940 to 1960, we explore how entry rates of TV stations were affected by audiences' expectations about the identity of the nascent domain and by the densities of organizations with different origins. We find evidence that focused expectations expressed through public discourse about media, and the number of stations coming from radio broadcasting increased entry rates. We reconcile our findings with existing theory on the emergence of organizational forms by pointing to the joint relevance of domain-related and candidate-related identities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0319","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['identity', 'audiences', 'emergence']","The article discusses the concept of identity framing and matching in the context of organizational forms, which touches on themes of perception and identity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity.

With recognition of the bounded rationality of decision makers and the goal-directed, rule-based nature of organizations, this model suggests that a comparison between firms' performance expectation and performance target translates the cognitive representation of the firms' future into their subsequent actions. By examining the research and development (R&D) expenditures of U.S. manufacturing firms from 1980 to 2001, this study explores how performance, aspirations, expectations, and slack affect decision making about firms' R&D search investments. The findings show that both performance feedback and performance prospect are important determinants of firms' search behavior after controlling for firm, industry, and time effects. In addition, backward- and forward-looking determinants have interactive effects on search behavior. Firms' problem-driven search activity further increases when firms feel unlikely to achieve the performance target for another year. In contrast, search intensity is reduced when firms expect to improve their performance from an underperforming situation to an outperforming situation. The findings suggest that future research on performance feedback and experiential learning should also consider the effect of forward-looking prospects on firm behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0320","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['behavioral theory', 'bounded rationality', 'decision making']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of R&D search behavior and decision-making processes without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

However, elucidating the precise nature of the trust-performance link in international strategic alliances remains an important theoretical and empirical challenge for management scholars. Discordant findings evident in existing alliance research raise concerns that interpartner trust does not always enhance venture performance. To investigate this issue, we build and test a theoretical framework that integrates different perspectives of alliance functioning by focusing on the social and bureaucratic forces critical to cooperative processes. The model (1) identifies organizational complexity mechanisms underlying the development of trust in international strategic alliances, (2) points to alliance size as an important factor that conditions the trust-performance relationship, (3) incorporates a new, third-order conceptualization of interpartner trust in alliances, and (4) suggests a theory-based multidimensional assessment of alliance performance. Based on data collected through personal interviews in 177 international strategic alliances, the results suggest that, while interpartner trust is positively associated with alliance performance, this relationship becomes stronger when alliance size declines. We find that both distributive fairness and partner similarity are central to the achievement of a trusting alliance partnership.

The Effect of Downside Risk, Accumulated Equity Wealth, and Firm Performance on CEO Equity Reduction","Although the alignment effect of equity ownership is often studied with emphasis on changes in firm strategy, the exposure of CEOs' firm-specific wealth to firm risk is more easily controlled by changing their level of equity holdings than by changing firm strategic risk. We rely on prospect theory and the behavioral theory of the firm to examine the antecedents of CEO equity reduction and investigate whether it serves to decouple CEO wealth from firm risk. Given its central role in loss avoidance, we underline the effect of the firm's downside risk and distinguish the total loss potential on equity holdings from the loss potential due to firm-specific factors. Allowing for own-performance referents, we also consider firm performance and the value of a CEO's equity holdings in the analysis. Based on a sample of 208 U.S. CEOs for the years 1997\u20131999, we find empirical support for the role of downside risk and firm performance in CEO equity reductions.

However, results conflict regarding how this search process influences risk taking in organizations. Managers in some organizations facing actual or expected performance shortfalls tend to take risks, while managers in other poorly performing organizations avoid risky changes. This conflict is interesting because some level of risk taking appears necessary for organizations to remain competitive, adapt to their environment, and improve performance. This study examines several mechanisms that moderate risk taking following performance shortfalls. First, I draw from organizational learning theories to argue that organizations with limited operating experience are less buffered from failure, and hence that poor performance constrains risk taking at these organizations. Second, I argue that organizations with poor legitimacy are also less buffered, and hence that performance shortfalls also lead to risk aversion at these organizations. Third, I draw from structural inertia theory to suggest that older organizations are less able to support risk taking following performance shortfalls. A test of these hypotheses on the capacity expansion behavior of U.S. railroad companies generally supports these hypotheses, although the effect of age is weaker. The findings contribute to theories of organizational learning and to several perspectives in organization theory more broadly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0335","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['risk taking', 'performance', 'legitimacy']","The article primarily focuses on organizational behavior and risk management without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This study introduces the notion of alliance portfolio internationalization (API), which refers to the degree of foreignness of partners in a firm's collection of immediate alliance relationships. We develop a framework to explain how API impacts firm performance. We suggest that as a firm's API increases, financial performance is expected to initially decline, then improve, and finally decline again. This sigmoid relationship between API and financial performance is ascribed to evolving learning effects that shape the net benefits of API. When the firm's alliance portfolio, on average, consists of proximate foreign partners, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences, but at moderate levels of API, its absorptive capacity and specialized collaborative routines support the exchange of valuable network resources. Nevertheless, high levels of API undermine firm performance because of the failure of collaborative routines and mounting liabilities of cross-national differences. We test the framework using data on the alliance portfolios of U.S.-based software firms from 1990 to 2001. The results provide support for the sigmoid relationship as well as for our predictions that firms, which have gained experience with foreign partners and maintained wholly owned subsidiaries in their partners' countries of origin, can overcome some of the liabilities of API and better leverage its benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0341","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of alliance portfolio internationalization and its impact on firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, when opportunism creates exchange hazards, which escalate in nonrecurring transactions, individuals will be reluctant to take full advantage of the gains from switching to more valuable partners, thereby leading to \u201coverembedded\u201d exchanges. Instead of embracing new, valuable exchanges with strangers whose propensity to cooperate is uncertain, individuals may prefer to preserve recurring ties with familiar actors. Two mechanisms may encourage movement out of committed relationships in those conditions. First, formal contracts should serve as a safeguard to market participants, in the sense that they limit potential losses due to opportunistic behavior. Second, trust in general others (as opposed to trust in familiar people) reduces participants' perception of hazards in market exchanges, and hence promotes transactions among strangers. By increasing the propensity to initiate new exchanges, general trust also diminishes the role of contracts in causing movement out of committed relationships. In this paper, we present experimental evidence largely consistent with this theory of the interplay between formal and informal mechanisms in the determination of social mobility.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0336","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'relationships', 'opportunism']","The article discusses trust and relationships in the context of market exchanges, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

However, theories of technological evolution and innovation remind us that networks may undergo significant change as technological discontinuities exert pressures on existing relationships and firms engage in exploratory search. How can we incorporate sources of change into our theories of network evolution instead of focusing so squarely on sources of inertia? By using recent advances in graph theory, we develop a more flexible theory of network evolution by examining two patterns of partner selection that have the potential to change networks: \u201cshortcut\u201d formation between relatively unconnected partner clusters, and the entry of new firms into the \u201cmain component\u201d of incumbent partners. Our findings suggest an important contingency for the endogeneity perspective: structural homophily predicts shortcut formation but not alliance formation within clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pattern of alliance formation between incumbents and new entrants to the alliance network is driven by a combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. New entrants attach to more prominent incumbents, but they are more likely to attach with an alliance deal that comprises multiple partners. We demonstrate these findings in an industry where systemic technology encourages cooperation and where network entry is prevalent\u2014the mobile communications industry from 1993\u20132002.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0339","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on network evolution and technological change without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By using ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the organization. This framing perspective suggests that frames are not only instrumental tools for the ex post justification of actions taken through power, but rather are an ex ante part of the political process that produces decisions. Uncertainty opens up the possibility for new actors to gain power, and contesting frames is a way of changing the power structures in the organization. A principal contribution of the framing contests model is to locate a middle ground between cognitive and political models of strategy making, one in which frames are both constraints and resources and outcomes can be shaped by purposeful action and interaction to make meaning.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1070.0340","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['cognitive frames', 'political practices', 'power structures']","The article discusses the influence of cognitive frames and political practices in organizational strategy making, indicating a moderate focus on the dynamics of power and decision-making processes.

Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics.

We theorize that preexisting interorganizational trust complements the choice of governance mode (make, ally, or buy) and also promotes substitution effects on governance mode choice while impacting exchange performance. We evaluate hypotheses using a novel three-stage switching regression model and a sample of 222 component-sourcing arrangements of two assemblers in the automobile industry. Analysis of our data broadly supports our hypotheses. High levels of preexisting interorganizational trust increased the probability that a less formal, and thus less costly, mode of governance was chosen over a more formal one. This finding suggests a substitution effect of interorganizational trust on governance mode choice that in turn shapes exchange performance. We also found a complementary effect of trust on performance: Regardless of the governance mode chosen for an exchange, trust enhanced exchange performance.

Little research has addressed issues related to compensating nondedicated teams, where team members perform tasks assigned by their home departments while also completing team work. In this paper, we provide analytical models to describe the unique decision-making processes engaged both by the firm and by such nondedicated team members. Our game-theoretic approach incorporates interdependency among team members into cross-functional team yield functions and takes into account the social benefits generated from team interactions for both firms and individual employees.

Mediating organizations facilitate exchange relationships on a continuous basis between multiple networks of interdependent affiliated actors. An affiliation structure gives rise to the property of duality whereby the behavior and performance of the affiliates affect the behavior and performance of mediators and vice versa. In the context of the banking industry, this study examines how the structural properties of the underlying network of affiliated organizations affect the survival of affiliated organizations and the performance of mediating organizations. The results show that firms that are affiliated with mediating organizations having high customer-set connectedness or with those that are industry specialists increase their chances of survival.

Our analysis builds on the previous studies that describe alternate ways in which a new product might open a new market and ultimately encroach on an existing market. Consider the example of cell phones: They opened up a new detached market by meeting the customer need for mobility, a need very different from the traditional attribute of reception quality. By meeting an important detached need, a new product can sell at a high price, even though it might be woefully deficient with regard to the traditional performance dimension (the reception/coverage of early cell phones was sorely lacking). A person who is a high\u2010end customer for the old product initially despises the new product as a replacement for the old one but might simultaneously be one of the first customers for the new product because it fills the detached\u2010market need. Over time, the new product improves along the traditional dimension (e.g., cell phone reception/coverage has dramatically improved), and eventually it becomes a replacement for the old product, encroaching from the lower end upward (the first customers to drop their landlines have been lower\u2010end customers such as students and apartment dwellers, whereas higher\u2010end business customers still have landlines in their offices). We call this the detached\u2010market form of low\u2010end encroachment and show how it helps explain the conundrum of an expensive \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovation.

Opening the source code to a software product often implies that consumers would not pay for the software product itself. However, revenues may be generated from complementary products. A software firm may be willing to open the source code to its software if it stands to build a network for its complementary products. The rapid network growth is doubly crucial in open source development, in which the users of the firm's products are also contributors of code that translates to future quality improvements. To determine whether or not to open the source, a software firm must jointly optimize prices for its various products while simultaneously managing its product quality, network size, and employment strategy. Whether or not potential gains in product quality, network size, and labor savings are sufficient to justify opening the source code depends on product and demand characteristics of both the software and the complementary product, as well as on the cost and productivity of in\u2010house developers relative to open source contributors.

The market consists of two customer segments with different preferences and is characterized by positive network effects. The commercial firm makes product and pricing decisions to maximize its profit. The open source developers make product decisions to maximize the weighted sum of the segments' consumer surplus, in addition to their intrinsic motivation. The more importance open source developers attach to consumer surplus, the more effort they put into developing software features. Even if consumers do not end up adopting the open source product, it can act as a credible threat to the commercial firm, forcing the firm to lower its prices. If the open source developers' intrinsic motivation is high enough, they will develop software regardless of eventual market dynamics. If the open source product is available first, all participants are better off when the commercial and open source products are compatible. However, if the commercial firm can enter the market first, it can increase its profits and gain market share by being incompatible with its open source competitor, even if customers can later switch at zero cost.

We develop a simple, stochastic model of a firm making investment decisions in process improvement. Our analysis offers several interesting insights into investments in process improvement. First, early investment in process improvement results in valuable knowledge, which helps increase the value of the option to invest in process improvement in future periods. This may motivate a firm to invest in process improvements as early as possible. Second, it may be optimal for a firm to stop investing when such investments do not create enough value in the later stages of the investment horizon. Third, although one would expect the state of a firm's process relative to that of other firms to impact a firm's decision to invest in process improvement, this study finds that the impetus is conditional and identifies these conditions. Finally, in such an environment, the delay of investment in process improvement incurs an opportunity cost for a firm, and we show that the traditional net present value rule must incorporate this opportunity cost and the knowledge\u2010induced change in future option values to lead to a correct investment decision.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3401/poms.1070.0008","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of process improvement and investment decisions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An important issue in implementing a vendor managed inventory scheme is the contracting terms that dictate the ownership of the inventory and the responsibility of inventory replenishment decisions. Thus the performance of a vendor managed system crucially depends on these terms and on how inventory\u2010related costs are shared in a supply chain. We consider a system where a manufacturer supplies a single product to a retailer who faces random demand in a competitive market. The retailer incurs a fixed cost per order, inventory holding cost, and a penalty cost for a stockout (unsatisfied demand is back\u2010ordered). Further, the manufacturer incurs a penalty cost when there is a stockout at the retailer and a fixed replenishment cost. We assume that the players are rational and act noncooperatively. We compare the performance of retailer managed inventory systems, where the retailer places orders and makes replenishment decisions, with vendor managed inventory systems, wherein the vendor or manufacturer makes inventory and replenishment decisions. Specifically, in the vendor managed inventory system, we propose and evaluate holding cost subsidy\u2010type contracts on inventories offered by the retailer to improve system performance. We evaluate this contract in the context of three widely used inventory systems\u2014deterministic economic order quantity, continuous review (Q, r) policies, and periodic review policies\u2014and show when such contracts may improve channel performance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3401/poms.1080.0011","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of vendor managed inventory systems and contracting terms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that when the spot market demand is small, the supplier that has forward contracts has a higher incentive to invest in expanding the spot market. When the spot market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making the spot market more prevalent. We show that a supplier with forward contracts benefits from the existence of the spot market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand. We find that suppliers producing only for the spot market gain from working in industries where contracted demand and spot market demand are positively correlated, whereas suppliers that have forward contracts benefit from working in industries with a negative correlation between demands, since it allows them to better manage risk.

Our numerical studies illustrate the benefits from the use of the flexible backup supplier as an emergency response, but for reasonable purchase premiums and short lead times of flexible backup supply options, their use in a dual (regular and emergency response) role often leads to improved performance over safety lead\u2010time single and uncertain lead\u2010time supplier\u2010replenishment strategies.

LEO satellites typically complete a revolution around the Earth in less than four hours at an altitude of a few hundred miles and are part of the critical infrastructure for natural resource management, crop yield estimation, meteorology, flood control, communication, and space research. Because these satellites are quite expensive to launch and operate, utilizing them in the best possible manner is of paramount importance for the agencies that own them. A ground station provides support time to a satellite to perform a variety of tasks when the satellite is visible to the station over a prespecified planning horizon; the payoff from providing such support is a function of the support time. When two or more satellites pass over the ground station, their visibility time windows may overlap. Thus, under overlapping visibilities, a relevant problem is that of scheduling ground station support time for each satellite with the objective of maximizing the total utility generated from supporting the satellites.

Managing these deposits is an important and complex inventory problem for two reasons. First, Federal Reserve regulations require that depository institutions hold certain amounts of such deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks to satisfy statutory reserve requirements against customers' transaction accounts (demand deposits and other checkable deposits). Second, some inventory of such deposits is essential for banks to operate one of their core lines of business: furnishing payment services to households and firms. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on such deposits used to satisfy statutory reserve requirements, banks seek to minimize their inventory of such deposits. In 1994, the banking industry introduced a new inventory management tool for such deposits, the retail deposit sweep program, which avoids the statutory requirement by reclassifying transaction deposits as savings deposits. This is an interesting inventory problem for fungible items, where the conversion process is reversible. We examine two methods for operating such sweeps programs within the limits of Federal Reserve regulations, and we develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to implement one such method, the threshold method.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3401/poms.1080.0028","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical inventory management problem in banking with no references to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper we argue that new service development success results from building a competence in the management of service development resources and routines. We conceptualize new service development competence as a multidimensional, second\u2010order latent construct that is represented by a system of four interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) formalized new service development processes, (2) market acuity, (3) new service development strategy, and (4) information technology use and experience. We hypothesize that the growth of new service development competence is related to improved new service development performance. Using structural equations modeling, we analyze survey data from 166 retail banks and report three key empirical findings. First, we show that the four hypothesized dimensions are statistically significant in defining new service development competence. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom in new product development, we find that formalized processes play a lesser role in the success of new service development compared with the other three dimensions. Instead, market acuity\u2014which captures the firm's ability to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers' evolving needs and wants\u2014was the most important new service development competence indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the positive effect of new service development competence on new service development performance and show that new service development competence is also significantly related to business\u2010level performance. Together, our empirical results suggest that complementary benefits arise from the adoption of a more holistic approach to the management of new service development at the program level.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3401/poms.1080.0034","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['service development', 'competence', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on operational competencies and performance metrics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Research has documented the reality of retail price dispersion, but little is known about how retail markups, in particular, are related to service quality and product attributes. For example, do Internet retailers deliver superior service in return for high markups? Do product characteristics affect the relationship between service and markups for retailers? To examine these issues, we first developed a model of Internet retail profitability that separates revenues and costs related to sales from other profit sources. This framework allowed us to position our work alongside the extant literature about Internet retailing. Moreover, it led us to synthesize service quality dimensions found in Internet retailing studies. We subsequently developed a critical\u2010event study based on the profit model and the synthesis of service quality dimensions to delineate service aspects that retailers should emphasize to address buyers' utility. Finally, we collected data from Internet purchases across retailers to isolate markup\u2010service quality trade\u2010offs along our delineated service aspects.

The seller may limit the availability of the product (that is, ration) in the second (clearance) period. Some customers are strategic and respond to the firm's decisions by timing their purchases. When capacity is nonconstraining and the seller has pricing flexibility, we show that rationing in the clearance period cannot improve revenue. However, when prices are fixed in advance, rationing can improve revenue. In the latter case, we conduct a detailed analysis for linear and exponential demand curves and derive explicit expressions for optimal rationing levels. We find that the policy of doing the better of not restricting availability at the clearance price or not offering the product at the clearance price is typically near optimal. Our analysis also suggests that rationing\u2014although sometimes offering considerable benefit over allowing unrestricted availability in the clearance period\u2014may allow the seller to obtain only a small fraction of the optimal revenue when the prices are chosen optimally without rationing.

In particular, previous models typically consider only three or four of five key revenue management features that we have purposely built into our model: (1) pricing, (2) resource allocation, (3) dynamic competition, (4) an explicit network, and (5) uncertain demand. Illustrative realizations of the abstract problem we study are those of airline revenue management and service provision by companies facing resource constraints. Under fairly general regularity conditions, we prove existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for dynamic oligopolistic service network competition described by our model.

We establish the existence and uniqueness of the pure\u2010strategy Nash equilibrium for the retailer game and study how a supplier can coordinate the system to achieve the best performance. Our main conclusions are as follows: First, a buyback contract can be used to coordinate retailers competing on both price and inventory in a sense that optimal retail prices and inventory levels arise as the Pareto\u2010dominant equilibrium. With symmetric retailers, the system optimum arises as the unique symmetric equilibrium. Second, the particular type of competition experienced by retailers (price versus inventory competition) affects the characteristics of the contract. Specifically, strong price competition leads to a coordination mechanism with a positive buyback rate, where the supplier subsidizes retailers for leftover inventories; however, strong inventory competition leads to a negative buyback rate, where retailers are punished for overstocking. Using a linear expected demand function, we further explore the impact of system parameters on the coordination contract and the competitive equilibrium. We also find that the performance of the supplier's optimal contract is asymptotic to the system optimal coordination contract as competition becomes fierce.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3401/poms.1080.0054","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain coordination and competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper considers a periodic\u2010review inventory system consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, where the manufacturer introduces new and improved products over an infinite planning horizon using the solo\u2010roll strategy. We consider two scenarios: (1) the manufacturer does not share the upstream information about new\u2010product introduction with the retailer and (2) the manufacturer shares the information. For each scenario, we first derive the decentralized ordering policy and the system\u2010optimal ordering policy with given cost parameters. We then devise an optimal supply chain contract that coordinates the inventory system. We demonstrate that when the inventory system is coordinated, information sharing improves the performance of both supply chain entities. However, this may not be true if the inventory system is not coordinated. We also show that under the optimal contract, the manufacturer has no incentive to mislead the retailer about new\u2010product information in the information\u2010sharing model. When demand variability increases, information sharing adds more benefits to the coordinated supply chain.

Through several specific mechanisms, buyers' green supply chain management initiated and then enabled the improvement of suppliers' environmental capabilities.

Second, we explicitly model the variable costs of manufacturing the single\u2010function and multifunction products.

We evaluate the benefits of sharing upstream yield information (e.g., a supplier sharing information with the manufacturer) in a two\u2010stage serial supply chain in which the supplier has multiple internal processes and is faced with uncertain output due to yield losses. We are interested in determining when the sharing of the supplier's information is most beneficial to the manufacturer.

In this model, a firm selling through the traditional supply chain of wholesaler and retailer opens a direct channel to the customer through Internet sales. Because both channels have their respective advantages, the manufacturer is attracted to this business model. However, it also leads to channel conflict, with the retailer feeling threatened by direct competition. One way of eliminating the possibility of this channel conflict, where the retailer is allowed to add value to the product to differentiate its offering to the customers, is proposed in this paper. The retailer is also given full authority to make pricing decisions. This paper presents a model, under this scenario, of obtaining optimum pricing decisions by both parties, the amount of value added by the retailer, and the manufacturer's wholesale price to the retailer. Our model incorporates information asymmetry, where the manufacturer has incomplete information about the retailer's cost of adding value.

Contrary to Dai and Singleton (2000), the tests show that when standard estimation techniques are used, affine models do a poor job of forecasting volatility at the short end of the term structure. Improving the volatility forecast does not require different models; rather, it requires a different estimation technique. The paper distinguishes between two econometric procedures for identifying volatility. The \u201ccross-sectional\u201d approach backs out volatility from a cross section of bond yields, and the \u201ctime-series\u201d approach imputes volatility from time-series variation in yields. For an affine model, the volatility implied by the time-series procedure passes the specification tests, while the cross-sectionally identified volatility does not. This is surprising, since under correct specification, the \u201ccross-sectional\u201d approach is maximum likelihood. One explanation is that affine models are slightly misspecified; another is that bond yields do not span volatility, as in Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002).","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/2/819/1608431","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical econometric methods related to financial modeling without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

In fixed samples, we show that the expected abnormal return is negative and becomes more negative as the holding period increases. Asymptotically, abnormal returns converge to zero provided that the process of the number of events is stationary. Nonstationarity in the process of the number of events is needed to generate a large negative bias. We present theory and simulations for the specific case of a lognormal model to characterize the magnitude of the small-sample bias. We illustrate the theory by analyzing long-term returns after initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs).","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/2/855/1609307","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and does not address any themes related to social justice, diversity, or ethics.

Ignoring such regimes, an unhedged US investor's optimal portfolio is strongly diversified internationally. The presence of regimes in the return distribution leads to a substantial increase in the investor's optimal holdings of US stocks, as does the introduction of skewness and kurtosis preferences.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/2/889/1610338","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset allocation and financial modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In contrast, closed-end fund flows forecast price returns, but not NAV returns. Furthermore, institutional flows display trend-following (trend-reversing) behavior in response to symmetric (asymmetric) movements in NAV and price returns.

Moreover, there will be a multiplicity of stochastic discount factors and each of them may give a different price for the new derivative security. This paper develops an approach to the selection of a stochastic discount factor for pricing a new derivative security. The approach is based on the idea that the price of a derivative security should not vary too much when the payoff of the primitive security is slightly perturbed, i.e., the price of the derivative should be robust to model misspecification. The paper develops two metrics of robustness. The first is based on robustness in expectation. The second is based on robustness in probability and draws on tools from the theory of large deviations. We show that in a stochastic volatility model, the two metrics yield analytically tractable bounds for the derivative price, as the underlying stochastic volatility model is perturbed. The bounds can be readily used for numerical examination of the sensitivity of the price of the derivative to model misspecification.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/3/1077/1563472","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of pricing derivative securities without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The cross-sectional approach resolves endogeneity problems associated with event study demonstrations of excess comovement. A trading strategy that bets on the reversion of stock prices of overweighted stocks generates economic profits, confirming that the observed comovement patterns are excessive, and providing further evidence that comovement of stock returns can be a consequence of commonality in trading behavior.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/3/1153/1563300","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock returns and trading strategies without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

This paper proposes modeling equity volatilities as a combination of macro- economic effects and time series dynamics. High-frequency return volatility is specified to be the product of a slow-moving component, represented by an exponential spline, and a unit GARCH. This slow-moving component is the low-frequency volatility, which in this model coincides with the unconditional volatility. This component is estimated for nearly 50 countries over various sample periods of daily data. Low-frequency volatility is then modeled as a function of macroeconomic and financial variables in an unbalanced panel with a variety of dependence structures. It is found to vary over time and across countries. The low-frequency component of volatility is greater when the macroeconomic factors of GDP, inflation, and short-term interest rates are more volatile or when inflation is high and output growth is low. Volatility is higher not only for emerging markets and markets with small numbers of listed companies and market capitalization relative to GDP, but also for large economies. The model allows long horizon forecasts of volatility to depend on macroeconomic developments, and delivers estimates of the volatility to be anticipated in a newly opened market.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/3/1187/1563802","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of volatility in financial markets without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice.

An extensive empirical analysis based on S&P 500 index options shows that our model outperforms other competing GARCH pricing models and ad hoc Black-Scholes models. We show that the flexible change of measure, the asymmetric GARCH volatility, and the nonparametric innovation distribution induce the accurate pricing performance of our model. Using a nonparametric approach, we obtain decreasing state-price densities per unit probability as suggested by economic theory and corroborating our GARCH pricing model.

We find that the na\u00efve predictor performs slightly better in hazard models and in out-of-sample forecasts than both the Merton DD model and a reduced-form model that uses the same inputs. Several other forecasting variables are also important predictors, and fitted values from an expanded hazard model outperform Merton DD default probabilities out of sample. Implied default probabilities from credit default swaps and corporate bond yield spreads are only weakly correlated with Merton DD probabilities after adjusting for agency ratings and bond characteristics. We conclude that while the Merton DD model does not produce a sufficient statistic for the probability of default, its functional form is useful for forecasting defaults.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/3/1339/1566804","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of financial modeling and forecasting without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We analyze the efficacy of these reforms in a model in which both adverse selection and moral hazard exist at the level of the firm's management. Delegating governance to the board improves monitoring but creates another agency problem because directors themselves avoid effort and are dependent on the CEO. We show that as directors become less dependent on the CEO, their monitoring efficiency may decrease even as they improve the incentive efficiency of executive compensation contracts. Therefore, a board composed of directors that are more independent may actually perform worse. Moreover, higher equity incentives for the board may increase equity-based compensation awards to management.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/3/1371/1564109","articles","RFS","Finance","2","['independence', 'equity', 'governance']","The article discusses corporate governance reforms and board independence, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of executive compensation and firm value without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This article shows that these seemingly incompatible results can be reconciled if the assumption of a fixed steady state mean of the economy is relaxed. We find strong empirical evidence in support of shifts in the steady state and propose simple methods to adjust financial ratios for such shifts. The in-sample forecasting relationship of adjusted price ratios and future returns is statistically significant and stable over time. In real time, however, changes in the steady state make the in-sample return forecastability hard to exploit out-of-sample. The uncertainty of estimating the size of steady-state shifts rather than the estimation of their dates is responsible for the difficulty of forecasting stock returns in real time. Our conclusions hold for a variety of financial ratios and are robust to changes in the econometric technique used to estimate shifts in the steady state.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/21/4/1607/2964875","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of stock-return predictability and econometric methods without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Less diversified shareholders have more to gain from taking their firm public, and are more willing to accept a lower price for shares. We test these hypotheses using the data on all IPOs in Sweden between 1995 and 2001. Using detailed information on the portfolio composition of shareholders in private and public firms, we construct several proxies of their portfolio diversification and relate them to the probability of the IPO and the underpricing. We show that the less diversified individual shareholders, especially those with lower wealth, sell more of their shares at the IPO. Firms held by less diversified controlling shareholders are more likely to go public, and exhibit higher underpricing. These effects are economically and statistically significant, while the diversification of noncontrolling shareholders has no effect.

Despite the prevalence of these alliances, we know little about how these firms choose to ally with specific firms given the range of possible partners they may choose from. This study explores factors that lead to alliance formation between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We focus on the alliance tie as the unit of analysis and argue that dyadic complementarities and similarities directly influence alliance formation. We then introduce a contingency model in which the positive effect of complementarities and similarities on alliance formation is moderated by the age of the new technology firm. We draw theoretical attention to the intersection between levels of analysis, in particular, the intersection between dyadic and firm-level constructs. We find that a pharmaceutical and a biotechnology firm are more likely to enter an alliance based on complementarities when the biotechnology firm is younger. Another noteworthy finding is that proxies for broad capabilities appear to be at least as effective, if not more so, in predicting alliance formation compared to fine-grained science and technology-related indicators, like patent cross-citations or patent common citations. We conclude by suggesting that future studies on alliance formation need to take into account interactions across levels; for example, how dyadic capabilities interact with firm-level factors, and the advantages and disadvantages of more or less fine-grained measures of organizational capabilities.

The inherent uncertainty of service customization gives rise to the transaction cost risks of opportunism and holdups and thus favors insourcing. Moreover, the competency gained from performing high-volume back-office operations aligns with the tenets of the resource-based view, which also favors insourcing.

The threat\u2013opportunity (TO) and feasibility\u2013urgency (FU) approaches primarily emphasize automatic/affective and active/deliberative strategic issue diagnosis processes, respectively. Current research, however, does not effectively integrate or fully explore the relationship between these two frameworks. We employ theory-building literature to develop a framework that highlights four distinct and increasingly integrative lenses through which such an exploration can be systematically carried out. Analyzing data from how firms reacted to the economic uncertainty of early 2003, the results of our study indicate that the FU approach is a better predictor of both intentions and actual responses than the TO approach. Our results also indicate that threat is positively related to urgency and negatively related to feasibility, while opportunity is positively related to feasibility and negatively related to urgency. Further, using the expectancy\u2013instrumentality\u2013valence (EIV) motivational theory as a framework, we factor analyze both TO and FU items, identifying three underlying constructs of favorability, urgency, and influence (which we dub FUI). FUI has a higher predictive efficacy than the TO approach alone. We highlight implications for theory building and research in the strategic issue diagnosis literature.

While they seek to avoid countries with high levels of macroeconomic uncertainty, we predict that they find it more attractive to expand into countries characterized by governments with discretionary policymaking capacities so as to be able to negotiate favorable conditions of entry. We also argue that firms are heterogeneous in their attitudes toward risk. We predict that firms in which the state holds a partial equity stake exhibit a more tolerant attitude. We also expect that as firms accumulate foreign experience, they develop an aversion toward further foreign entries into politically unstable markets. Support for these predictions is provided by an analysis of the Latin American market entries of all listed Spanish firms in regulated industries between 1987 and 2000.

I propose that competitive intensity determines the likelihood of firm collaboration, and that the interaction of competitive intensity and collaboration influences firm growth. These relationships are, in turn, moderated by industry-level technological intensity. Analyzing 1,004 firms and 378 collaborations from the manufacturing sector in Singapore, I find that firms facing high or low levels of competitive intensity collaborate less often than those facing moderate levels of competitive intensity. Industry technology intensity moderates this relationship, with a stronger inverted-U-shaped association between competitive intensity and collaboration in more technology intensive industries. Collaboration leads to higher growth for firms facing lower levels of competitive intensity than for firms facing higher levels of competitive intensity only in more technology intensive industries. In technologically less intensive industries, collaboration leads to higher growth for firms facing higher levels of competitive intensity as compared to those facing lower levels of competitive intensity. These findings have important implications for competitive and collaborative dynamics for firm growth in different technological environments.

Specifically, we argue that external constituents\u2014including customers, regulators, legislators, local communities, and environmental activist organizations\u2014who interact with influential corporate departments are more likely to affect facility managers' decisions. As a result, managers of facilities that are subjected to comparable institutional pressures adopt distinct sets of management practices that appease different external constituents. We test our framework in the context of the adoption of environmental management practices using an original survey and archival data obtained for nearly 500 facilities. We find support for these hypotheses.

Using longitudinal data on a sample of business format franchisors operating in North America, we show that the cross-sectional evidence commonly used to demonstrate support for efficient contracting explanations for organizational governance form is not robust to the year of investigation, firm effects, or selection effects. We theorize that this outcome may result from dynamic processes through which a firm's organizational governance form evolves. We develop and test two hypotheses for the effects of organizational momentum on organizational governance form, and find that organizational momentum is a robust predictor. Our results suggest that researchers consider the dynamics of momentum in explaining the form of firm governance.

Since the early 1990s, numerous studies have examined RBT's assertion that the extent to which organizations possess strategic resources is positively related to performance. Although many studies appear to support this assertion, there is no consensus regarding how strongly strategic resources relate to performance. To help resolve this issue, we meta-analyze 125 studies of RBT that collectively encompass over 29,000 organizations. Our conservative estimate is that the effect size of the strategic resources\u2013performance relationship is r\u0304c = 0.22. Moderator tests suggest that the resources-performance link is stronger (1) when resources meet the criteria laid out in RBT and (2) for those performance measures that are not affected by potential value appropriation. When resources meet RBT's criteria and when performance measures are not affected by potential appropriation, the strength of the relationship grows to r\u0304c = 0.29. This suggests that the identification, development, and distribution of value from strategic resources should be a primary consideration for scholars, managers, and shareholders.

The effects of outside director acquisition experience on firm acquisition performance","This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Findings indicate that science and money do not unconditionally go together\u2013the direct relationship between rent-accruing resources (e.g., patents or articles) and rent appropriation varies depending on the type of resources and the strategic orientation. Moreover, the effects of strategic determinants differ for rent generation vs. rent appropriation: 1) technological application diversity undermines a firm's capacity to appropriate rents\u2013in particular for research-oriented firms; 2) exploitation alliances favor rent generation but hinder rent appropriation; 3) service-oriented firms exhibit significantly better performance than research-oriented firms.

However, the question of which organizational policies lead to knowledge sharing between multinational units is still not fully understood. In particular, the link between compensation mechanisms and knowledge sharing has not received attention in previous studies. By studying 164 foreign-owned subsidiaries located in Finland and China, this article attempts to identify the relationship between subsidiary bonus pay based on MNC-wide performance and knowledge sharing between different units of the MNC. In line with the knowledge-based perspective of the firm, the results suggest that incentive pay based on the collective performance of the MNC leads to greater knowledge sharing.

An analysis of the relationship between corporate social and financial performance","This study explores the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) within the context of a specific component of CSP: corporate charitable giving. A model of the determinants of the extent of corporate charitable giving is estimated and used as the basis of a classification that groups firms according to the difference between their actual and their predicted intensity of gift giving. The financial performance attributes of the classification are explored. We found that firms with both unusually high and low CSP have higher financial performance than other firms, with unusually poor social performers doing best in the short run and unusually good social performers doing best over longer time horizons.

First, in a high-velocity market where capabilities change quickly, how does entry timing depend on the capabilities at varying points in time? Second, how much flexibility does a firm have in altering its capabilities to achieve desirable entry timing? To answer these questions, this study sets out to develop a dynamic, refined version of the resource-based view that parameterizes a firm by its time-varying capability relevance with respect to a focal market, and makes predictions on entry timing and future growth of capability relevance. The study develops a novel approach that uses the entrants' product portfolios to infer a potential entrant's capability relevance. The results based on a panel of potential entrants show that the initial and current capability relevance each affect entry timing alone, revealing the persistent effect of the initial condition. However, given the knowledge of the current capability relevance, the initial relevance has no effect on entry timing, suggesting that the initial relevance affects entry timing through its influence on the current relevance. Firms that are in an initially unfavorable position can still achieve early entry, provided that they improve their capability relevance over time.

Additionally, and aligned with property rights theoretic predictions, service suppliers' bargaining power and their indispensability in service projects are positively associated with their ability to retain control rights. In contrast, innovation capabilities are not very significant in determining control rights allocation between service suppliers and their clients.

We argue that this disconnect has created artificial boundaries between the two perspectives and has limited our ability to develop holistic explanations of strategic action. In response, we develop an integrated model that answers two questions: 1) Does industry context affect managerial cognition? 2) Does managerial cognition mediate the relationship between industry context and strategic responses to environmental changes? To examine these questions, we study the relationship between industry velocity, the structure of top management's cognitive representation of the environment, and the speed of response to environmental events. We find that industry velocity influences the structure of cognitive representations, which in turn influence the speed of response to environmental events. These results support our contention that both industry and cognition variables are critical in developing explanations of strategic actions. These results have implications for our understanding of the development of top managers' beliefs, the relationship between beliefs and action, and the nature of the complex relationship between industry context, managerial cognition, and strategic action.

While theories of when markets fail are well developed, the extant literature provides a less than adequate explanation of why and when hierarchies fail and of actions managers take to mitigate such failure. In this article, we seek to develop a more complete theory of the firm by theorizing about the causes and consequences of organizational failure. Our theory focuses on the concept of social comparison costs that arise through social comparison processes and envy. While transaction costs in the market provide an impetus to move activities inside the boundaries of the firm, we argue that envy and resulting social comparison costs motivate moving activities outside the boundary of the firm. More specifically, our theory provides an explanation for \u2018managerial\u2019 diseconomies of both scale and scope\u2014arguments that are independent from traditional measurement, rent seeking, and competency arguments\u2014that provides new insights into the theory of the firm. In our theory, hierarchies fail as they expand in scale because social comparison costs imposed on firms escalate and hinder the capacity of managers to optimally structure incentives and production. Further, hierarchy fails as a firm expands in scope for the simple reason that the costs of differentially structuring compensation within the firm to match the increasing diversity of activities also rises with increasing scope. In addition, we explore how social comparison costs influence the design of the firm through selection of production technologies and compensation structures within the firm.

We explore the content and structure of top managers' strategic knowledge structures by measuring differences in the level of attention they give in annual reports to strategic issues and themes that Miles and Snow used to describe their main strategic types. Twenty-one themes that form seven main factors describing managers' strategic cognition are identified, and these demonstrate reasonable fit with the Miles and Snow model. We show that expert raters can recognize these factors when they read annual reports that contain them. Cluster analysis is then used to identify groups of firms that share similar profiles on these strategic dimensions which are interpreted as examples of cognitive strategic groups. These groups show alignment with Miles and Snow's strategic types, are relatively stable over time, and differ in financial performance. The sample comprises 1,038 listed Australian firms between the years 1992 and 2003.

This study is a step toward filling this gap by examining how mimetic entry within reference groups and the emergence of a competing strategy affect the bandwagon phenomenon of a dominant strategy in the context of China, where international equity joint ventures (EJVs) used to be a dominant entry strategy among foreign firms in the 1990s. Findings from a sample of 1,123 EJVs formed in China's non-restricted industries from 1990 to 2003 show that the impact of home and host-country industry effects are not symmetric between the EJV rise and decline periods. Cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) as a competing strategy has an important impact during the EJV decline period but not the rise period. The interactive effects between EJV and M&A strategies occur only in the host-country industries. We discuss such results and offer suggestions for future research.

Lessons from the management of clinical trials","For over three decades, the benefits of focus have been touted under the guiding principle that dedicated attention to a small set of linked tasks improves operating performance. Numerous studies have suggested that the performance of a division, plant, or business unit is improved to the extent that it remains focused on a narrow range of activities. Others have found similar benefits associated with focus at the level of the entire firm. A question that has received less attention, however, is whether focus at the divisional level is complementary with, or a substitute for, focus at the firm level. We explore this question by considering the performance of investigative sites in biopharmaceutical clinical trials. First, we establish that firms focusing on a particular task\u2014at either a divisional or firm level\u2014experience higher output and productivity with respect to that task than unfocused firms. After controlling for selection, scale, and learning effects, we find that sites that focus on conducting clinical trials significantly outperform those that mix trial activity with the provision of traditional patient care. Second, we find evidence that focus at the divisional level and firm level are substitutes. That is, organizations characterized by divisional focus alone achieve statistically similar performance to sites that are characterized by both divisional and firm focus.

They argue that managers and owners have information asymmetries with respect to the assets in the restructuring and the restructured firms' diversification strategy, and that managers select between two popular implementation alternatives, spin-offs and sell-offs, to convert knowledge differences into financial gain. When the restructured assets reside in primary and related business lines or the firm has low and related diversification among its business lines, the restructuring is difficult for observers to assess and understand. Spin-offs most effectively and profitably reduce information asymmetries by transferring assets to the capital market and increasing the efficiency and transparency of the restructuring firm. Conversely, when the restructured assets reside in secondary and unrelated business lines or the firm has high diversification, sell-offs best mitigate asymmetries by using market forces to reallocate assets to their most productive uses while improving the strategy and performance of the restructuring firm. Tests of a sample of 204 restructuring events support the hypotheses. Overall, the findings suggest that the influence of corporate restructuring on financial performance is determined in part through how the restructuring is implemented.

Firms within strategic groups generally adopt similar strategic recipes and compete more intensely than firms across strategic groups. Building on recent research, the authors develop the concept of hybrid strategic groups, which blend the strategic recipes of more than one group, in contrast to existing conceptualizations of strategic groups, where either firms tightly follow the recipes of a strategic group (i.e., core firms) or firms loosely follow the recipes of a strategic group (i.e., secondary firms). Thus, competition among firms depends not only on the strategic group but also on the overlap of that strategic group with other strategic groups. The authors devise a combinatorial optimization-based classification procedure utilizing a bilinear model that accommodates multiple variable batteries that can estimate hybrid strategic groups. The proposed methodology is illustrated by using archival data on public banks. For this illustration, the hybrid strategic group solution outperforms ordinary cluster analyses and offers critical insights into the nature of competition among firms.

Here, predictions are developed to explain how mutual forbearance occurs\u2014but sometimes fails\u2014in markets with imperfect observability. Mutual forbearance means that firms do not seek to take market share from each other through price cuts or nonprice competition, and thus that sales grow at uniform rates. Firms defect from mutual forbearance, and hence have higher sales growth, if the potential rewards are high and the likelihood of being discovered is low. This theory is tested on a panel of firms operating in the Norwegian general insurance industry. The evidence suggests that sales growth is most rapid in firms that do not meet many multimarket competitors in a given market and firms that are economically troubled. Growing or highly concentrated markets have higher heterogeneity of growth rates.

Competition, uncertainty, and domestic vs. foreign firms","While most advocate that foreign firms should utilize managerial ties to conduct business in China, recent literature cautions that such ties may offer only conditional value. This study examines three sources of heterogeneity that may condition the value of ties: firm ownership (foreign vs. domestic), competition, and structural uncertainty. Results from a survey of 280 firms in China indicate that though foreign and domestic firms utilize ties at a similar level, their performance gains from tie utilization differ. Managerial ties have a monotonic, positive effect on performance for domestic firms, whereas the effect is curvilinear (i.e., inverted U-shaped) for foreign firms. Therefore, compared with domestic firms, foreign firms have a competitive disadvantage from tie utilization. Furthermore, managerial ties are less effective for fostering performance when competition becomes more intense. However, ties lead to higher levels of firm performance when structural uncertainty increases. Overall, these results support the contingency view of managerial ties and caution companies about the unconditional use of ties as the market becomes more heterogeneous.

Theoretically, these different cues are believed to affect the scientists' expectation of reciprocity, and thus their know-how transfer behavior. Three types of contextual cues between the know-how source and recipient were studied: competitiveness, social relationship, and within or across firm boundaries.

While multiple factors may affect alliance success, partner selection emerges as one of the most influential. Previous studies on alliances present general models that assume the factors (e.g., trust, commitment, complementarity, financial payoff) that drive partner attractiveness and, in turn, the likelihood of selection, are consistent across varying alliance projects and situations. In contrast, the present study proposes a contingency approach grounded in management control theory that suggests the criteria managers use in choosing alliance partners will vary by alliance project type. Specifically, it introduces a framework that addresses when and why managers select partners with certain, specific characteristics. The results of the present study strongly support hypotheses that the critical criteria for assessing alliance partner attractiveness and selection vary depending on the differential levels of process manageability and outcome interpretability inherent in a strategic alliance. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

This study addresses the complex issue of alliance performance. We follow 100 contractual alliances over a 5-year period, and study their performance in terms of abrupt termination, short-term performance, and long-term performance. The results indicate that alliances that are considered strategically important are less likely to be abruptly terminated. We also find that newly established alliances have a higher termination rate than older alliances. Short-term performance is primarily affected by access to complementary and strategically important resources, whereas long-term performance is related to specific investments in human capital combined with the partners' ability to develop and expand alliance activities over time.

Drawing from two viewpoints of organizational learning, absorptive capacity and organizational improvisation, we examine whether experience with corporate restructuring modes (sell-offs, spin-offs) influences subsequent restructuring and financial performance. Consistent with an absorptive capacity view, cumulative and repetitive experience with sell-offs was related to the adoption of an ensuing sell-off and to higher performance. Conversely, and consistent with an organizational improvisation view, short-term and contemporaneous experience with spin-offs was related to the subsequent use of spin-offs and to increases in financial performance. The findings contribute to a dynamic explanation of corporate restructuring and its influence on financial performance, illustrate differences between learning in a repetitive situation and learning when repetition is rare, and indicate when absorptive capacity and organizational improvisational views are most profitable. Overall, these findings show that different kinds of restructuring experiences were associated with different modes of restructuring and performance records. Considered collectively, the organizational learning perspective offers insights into why some corporate restructuring strategies appear as intentional and deliberate actions while others resemble more spontaneous and simultaneous responses.

Prominent alliance networks emphasize benefits arising out of multiple access and affiliation to other prominent firms in the network. An entrepreneurial position, on the other hand, emphasizes brokerage and diversity benefits arising out of access to nonredundant and diverse information. We demonstrate that the performance benefits of each type of alliance network are contingent on environmental change and strategy, and are thus time dependent. Following an environmental change event in the steel industry, alliance networks that were more entrepreneurial performed better, while those that were more prominent suffered performance decline. However, when the change was radical, both types of alliance networks were negatively related to performance. We suggest that following a radical change, industry alliance networks may not have the requisite information necessary for quick and effective strategic responses. Firms pursuing an analyzer strategy performed better when emphasizing a prominent, and to a lesser extent, entrepreneurial alliance network. However, firms that develop an alliance network high on both prominent and entrepreneurial structural positions had lower relative performance. Our results indicate the need for managers to assess their alliance portfolio over time and redesign it based on environmental and strategic contingencies.

A study of alliance performance in software outsourcing","Although control is presumed to be necessary to curb opportunism, its implementation in alliances can be costly and challenging. Paradoxically, some contemporary firms have counterintuitively developed successful alliances without extensive formal control. A widespread but untested assertion that might help reconcile this contradiction is that technological modularity reduces the need for alliance control. The objective of this study is to develop and test this assertion. Using data from 120 software outsourcing alliances, we show that, process control, outcome control, and modularity independently enhance alliance performance. However modularity and control are imperfect substitutes: modularity lowers the influence of process control but not of outcome control on alliance performance.

This study examines the possibility that corporate social performance enhances financial performance by allowing the firm to differentiate, and that this effect may be moderated both by innovation, which also drives firm differentiation, and the level of differentiation in the industry. Hypotheses concerning both direct and moderating effects are developed and tested using secondary data. Our results support both innovation and the level of differentiation in the industry as moderators for a positive relationship between corporate social performance and financial performance: corporate social performance most strongly affects performance in low-innovation firms and in industries with little differentiation.

Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995\u20131999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

Employees' investments in specific human capital are often critical to the success of a real option project, but the very flexibility that allows a firm to change course in response to new information also affects employees' incentives to make such specific human capital investments. We develop a model of real option investment that explicitly incorporates the role of employee incentives. The model suggests that the effect of investing in a real option project on employee incentives may be positive, further increasing the value of the project, or negative, sometimes more than offsetting the benefit of flexibility and resulting in reduced project value. Therefore, firms and managers should take into consideration the role of employee incentives when applying real options logic to investment decision making.

We examine what effects differences in the recency of knowledge inputs have on financial performance. Using threshold regression analysis, we isolate three regimes that exhibit different associations between recency and stock return. We find that for firms whose new patents use inputs in the mid-range of the technological recency distribution, the relationship is positive; higher recency leads to higher stock return. However, for firms whose new patents make use of either nascent or very mature technological inputs, the effects are negative; higher recency leads to lower stock return. These findings indicate that it is not firms utilizing the most recent technological inputs that experience the highest returns to their inventive activity. Indeed, firms operating at the technological input frontier have market returns significantly below the mean. Rather, it is firms whose new patents utilize medial-aged technological inputs (i.e., firms using inputs slightly behind the technology frontier) that tend to experience the highest returns.

Drawing upon previous reseach on information asymmetry and adverse selection in CEO selection, I argue that the board of directors may make a poor selection at the time of CEO succession, and as a result, must dismiss the appointee after succession when better information about him/her is obtained. Therefore, the level of information asymmetry at the time of succession increases the likelihood of dismissal. With data on 204 newly appointed CEOs, the results of this study support this argument. After controlling for alternative explanations of CEO dismissal (e.g., firm performance and political factors), the results show that the likelihood of dismissal of newly appointed CEOs is higher in outside successions and/or if the succession follows the dismissal of the preceding CEO. Further, if at the time of succession, the firm's board has a nominating committee that is independent and/or on which outside directors have few external directorships, the likelihood of dismissal is lower. Contributions to the CEO dismissal/succession literature are discussed.

Specifically, we address two research questions. Under what conditions does imitation erode the advantage of the innovator? What strategies of imitators help overcome the innovator's advantage? Our main argument is that the increasing availability of information on the innovator's product increases the imitator's returns to waiting. With this increasing availability of information, imitators' products transition from those that are horizontally differentiated (products are similar in quality but differ in their attributes) to those that are vertically differentiated (products differ in quality). Thus, we hypothesize that shifts in the nature of competition over time from horizontal differentiation to vertical differentiation account for why the innovator's advantage is not preserved. Imitation timing simply reflects the uncertainty inherent in imitation efforts. One such uncertainty is the extent of product differentiation that the imitator can achieve. We develop several hypotheses that elaborate this basic intuition. We obtained detailed data on innovator-imitator competition in the branded drug industry to test the hypotheses. All our hypotheses are supported. The main contribution of the article is in showing that the nature of product differentiation in product categories is endogenous to the imitative entry decisions of firms.

The novelty of the approach is to consider the outsourced function as involving resources consistent with the resource-based view of the firm. From a bargaining perspective, we characterize a downstream firm's decision whether to outsource to an independent or to an established upstream firm. In so doing, the downstream firm faces a trade-off between lower input costs afforded by independent competition, and higher resource value associated with those who can consolidate upstream capabilities. We show that this trade-off is resolved in favor of outsourcing to an established firm.

These technologies can represent a huge cost for adopting firms, but may also offer the chance to achieve competitive advantage through superior manufacturing. While prior research has considered a range of production process decisions (e.g., JIT, mass customization) and outcomes for end-product technologies, little attention has been given to adoption decisions relative to core manufacturing technologies. This study examines an industry's adoption of major manufacturing technologies over several decades and demonstrates that two groups of contingencies related to adoption (e.g., timing and cumulative effects) have a significant impact on firm performance. Based on a sample of over 1,000 firms, the results provide insights into the effects of adoption timing and \u2018manufacturing technology bundles\u2019 on firm survival. We also find that adoption of manufacturing technologies prior to the inflection point of the estimated Bass diffusion curve for each technology leads to significant reduction in firm mortality. Thus, we are able to demonstrate the ability of the Bass model to predict the survival outcomes of firms facing manufacturing technology adoption decisions. The strategic implications of these pivotal decisions are considered.

Based on conceptual and formal analysis, the authors state that in complex and novel contexts, analogical reasoning may be superior to two established models: rational choice and local incremental search. I show that given an alternative conceptualization of the strategy-making context and main models, analogical reasoning is not necessarily superior. Furthermore, in novel and complex contexts, this model and other approaches such as mental experimentation can play a larger role, particularly in inventing effective strategies. I further extend the analysis by considering some boundary conditions in which analogical reasoning and its alternatives best apply, exploring the idea that blending and adapting several search strategies may be more effective than using only one method, such as analogical reasoning, and advancing new directions for empirical research.

First, he suggests our approach should have explicitly considered a constructionist logic. Second, Farjoun argues that we have neglected the full array of modes of cognition between rational choice and feedback-based adaptive learning and have therefore overstated the role of our focal mode, reasoning by analogy. Third, he highlights some of the contingencies under which the various modes of cognition he identifies are effective. In response, we address each point. We first argue that a constructionist perspective is not alien either to the role of analogical reasoning or to the particular modeling apparatus we have developed. We then suggest that despite the richness of modes of cognition that lie between rational choice and adaptive learning, theorizing about them requires simplification and the identification of underlying categories that classify such modes, which is the approach our paper employs. Finally, we clarify how our paper adopts the contingent logic advocated by Farjoun.

Using a model integrating institutional, resource dependence, resource-based, and cognitive theoretical perspectives, we examine the restaurant industry's response to the fat reduction pressure campaign run by a nutritional interest group, the National Heart Saver's Association (NHSA) in the early 1990s. Our findings indicate that susceptibility to institutional pressures partially affected accommodation to NHSA's demands, and more strongly affected organizational cognitions of those pressures. Our measure of resource dependence did not directly affect accommodation, but was significantly related to managerial cognitions. Resource-based factors had a strong direct effect on the extent of accommodation to the pressures of NHSA, and partially influenced measures of cognition. Further, our findings indicate that managerial cognition strongly influenced an organization's response to NHSA pressure. From these results we suggest strategies for managers as they try to make sense of and respond to interest group pressures. We also point to future avenues of inquiries for researchers.

Previous research has shown that through such alliances suppliers acquire knowledge to forge new capabilities and attain performance improvements. We ask whether such improvements are exclusive to the learning partnership, or are available in other average partnerships of this supplier. We posit that the extent to which such performance improvements are partnership exclusive depends on whether the newly forged capabilities lie entirely within the supplier firm's boundaries, or at the learning dyad level. As such, we untie two forms of performance improvements arising from learning dyads. While the resource-based view helps explain the performance gains learning suppliers deploy across average partners, the relational view reveals the additional performance edge that remains exclusive to the learning partnership. Based on empirical evidence from a survey of 253 suppliers to the equipment industry, we find that partnership exclusive performance (i.e., \u2018relational performance\u2019), the true source of learning dyads' competitive advantage, is a function of suppliers acquiring know-how within the dyad, developing dyad-specific assets and capabilities, and structuring buyer-supplier relational governance mechanisms.

In particular, MO behavior fully mediates the effects of MO culture on employee satisfaction, product quality, and organizational performance. Leadership quality strengthens the effect of MO culture on unit-level MO behavior. Moreover, MO behavior enhances firm performance indirectly through employee job satisfaction and product quality.

Specifically, we examine how accounting quality affects the borrower's choice of private versus public debt market and how the design of debt contracts vary with accounting quality in the two markets. We find that accounting quality affects the choice of the market, with poorer accounting quality borrowers preferring private debt, i.e., bank loans. This is consistent with banks possessing superior information access and processing abilities that reduce adverse selection costs for borrowers. We also find that accounting quality has an economically significant but differential impact on contract design in the two markets consistent with differences in recontracting flexibility across the two markets. In the case of private debt, since there is greater recontracting flexibility, both the price (i.e., interest) and non\u2010price (i.e., maturity and collateral) terms are significantly more stringent for poorer accounting quality borrowers, unlike public debt where only the price terms are more stringent. The impact of accounting quality on interest spreads of public debt is 2.5 times that of the private debt, since the price terms alone reflect the variation in accounting quality.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/1/1/2974/Accounting-Quality-and-Debt-Contracting","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting quality and its impact on debt contracting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Anecdotal evidence and surveys suggest that managers believe that missing an earnings target can cause stock\u2010price drops (Graham et al. 2006). Empirical studies corroborate this notion (Skinner and Sloan 2002; Lopez and Rees 2002). Thus, a missed target could benefit an executive via lower strike price on subsequent option grants. Prior option grant studies explore only general downward earnings management (Balsam et al. 2003; Baker et al. 2003), but our study is the first to explore whether option grants encourage missed earnings targets. Indeed, if missed targets drive the prior results, then the literature has failed to document an important negative outcome of stock\u2010option incentives. We use quarterly and annual data for fixed\u2010date options granted after firms announce they have missed earnings targets. We find that firms that miss earnings targets have larger and more valuable subsequent grants. Further, we find that the likelihood of missing earnings targets for firms that manage earnings downward increases with stock\u2010option grants. To control for the possibility that firms miss earnings targets for operational reasons, we only include firms that likely managed earnings downward (Dechow et al. 1995; Phillips et al. 2003). Backdating or opportunistic timing of grants cannot explain our results because we include only fixed\u2010date grants. While many studies explicitly consider whether and why managers meet or beat earnings targets, ours is the first study to find that some managers may seek to miss earnings targets (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997).","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/1/185/2979/Executive-Stock-Options-Missed-Earnings-Targets","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of stock options and earnings management without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2008","83","1","Hollis Ashbaugh\u2010Skaife; \n\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Hollis Ashbaugh\u2010Skaife\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        aUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n                            \n            Daniel W.

Second, we find that firms that report internal control deficiencies have significantly larger positive and larger negative abnormal accruals relative to control firms. This finding suggests internal control weaknesses are more likely to lead to unintentional errors that add noise to accruals than intentional misstatements that bias earnings upward. Third, we document that firms whose auditors confirm remediation of previously reported internal control deficiencies exhibit an increase in accrual quality relative to firms that do not remediate their control problems. Finally, we find firms that receive different internal control audit opinions in successive years exhibit changes in accrual quality consistent with changes in internal control quality.

We label this measure the \u201clong\u2010run cash effective tax rate.\u201d We use the long\u2010run cash effective tax rate to examine (1) the extent to which some firms are able to avoid taxes over periods as long as ten years, and (2) how predictive one\u2010year tax rates are for long\u2010run tax avoidance. In our sample of 2,077 firms, we find there is considerable cross\u2010sectional variation in tax avoidance. For example, approximately one\u2010fourth of our sample firms are able to maintain long\u2010run cash effective tax rates below 20 percent, compared to a sample mean tax rate of approximately 30 percent. We also find that annual cash effective tax rates are not very good predictors of long\u2010run cash effective tax rates and, thus, are not accurate proxies for long\u2010run tax avoidance. While there is some evidence of persistence in annual cash effective tax rates, the persistence is asymmetric. Low annual cash effective tax rates are more persistent than are high annual cash effective tax rates. An initial examination of characteristics of firms successful at keeping their cash effective tax rates low over long periods shows that they are well spread across industries but with some clustering.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/1/61/2970/Long-Run-Corporate-Tax-Avoidance","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['tax avoidance', 'corporate', 'effective tax rate']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of corporate tax avoidance without addressing social justice, ethical implications, or the impact on marginalized groups.

Specifically, we find that after large or negative earnings surprises there is a greater reduction in the error in individual analysts' forecasts of future earnings, and these individual forecasts are based more heavily on individual analysts' private information. This increased reliance on private information reduces the error in the mean forecast of upcoming earnings (even after controlling for the effect of reduced error in individual forecasts).

To do this, I conduct experiments in which managers must decide whether to continue using an existing asset or invest in a replacement asset. By design, replacing the existing asset yields higher cash flows and managers are aware of this fact. However, if the asset is replaced, then the greater remaining book value under straight\u2010line depreciation relative to accelerated depreciation causes earnings to be lower. Lower earnings and psychological forces may push managers of firms that use straight\u2010line depreciation away from making the economically efficient capital investment decision. The results suggest that managers of firms that use straight\u2010line depreciation are less likely to invest in a replacement asset than are managers of firms that use accelerated depreciation. Further, the results suggest that managers perceive that an asset depreciated using straight\u2010line depreciation has provided less retrospective utility than an asset depreciated using accelerated depreciation. In turn, I find that depreciation method\u2010induced differences in managers' retrospective utility perceptions influence their prospective utility perceptions, which, in turn, influence managers' asset replacement decisions. By theoretically and empirically linking firms' depreciation method choice to managers' capital investment decisions, I provide evidence that a seemingly innocuous choice made for external financial reporting purposes can cause managers to make non\u2010value\u2010maximizing capital investment decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/2/351/2980/The-Effect-of-Firms-Depreciation-Method-Choice-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and their impact on managerial decisions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Results suggest that firms beating earnings benchmarks have a higher probability of rating upgrades and a smaller initial bond yield spread. Additional analyses indicate that (1) the benefits of beating earnings benchmarks are more pronounced for firms with high default risk; (2) beating the zero earnings benchmark generally provides the biggest reward in terms of a lower cost of debt; and (3) the reduction in the cost of debt is attenuated but does not disappear for firms beating benchmarks through earnings management. In sum, results suggest that there are benefits associated with beating earnings benchmarks in the debt market.

Technologies develop and flourish or die out through the combined investment decisions of those firms doing the inventing, and those firms that adopt those inventions, and thereby help to spread (or diffuse) the innovations into wider use. Hence, technology is important for the investment decisions of all firms, regardless of whether they patent. We focus on three aggregate measures of technological innovation conditions: the success rate of past technological investments, technology complexity, and the technology development period. We use the interactions between each of these three conditions with earnings to capture the combined effect on market value of a firm's technological innovation environment. Our sample comprises 12,594 U.S. firm years for the period 1990\u20132000 including firms actively producing new technologies and firms that adopt technologies for their processes and products. Our primary and additional tests suggest that the interactions capture value\u2010relevant information not reflected in commonly used variables including industry, research and development, sales, general, and administration expenses, risk, and growth. We also triangulate our results by providing evidence that aggregate technological innovation conditions predict future earnings and are, hence, instrumental in the earnings\u2010generation process. This paper extends the valuation literature by (1) developing a generalizable framework that explains how technological innovation conditions link to future earnings and therefore map into the market value of equity; (2) developing aggregate measures of technological innovation conditions that are relevant for estimating future earnings and value for all firms; and (3) providing detailed empirical evidence on the relation between these aggregate measures and the market value of equity and earnings for all firms not just those that patent.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/2/479/2984/The-Association-between-Technological-Conditions","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technological innovation conditions and their impact on market value and earnings, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

I measure the information content of earnings using a standard earnings\u2010returns framework over several years surrounding restatements to examine characteristics of the decline in the information content of earnings. Results indicate that although the information content of earnings declines following restatements, the loss is temporary. In particular, the earnings response coefficients for earnings announcements surrounding restatements exhibit a U\u2010shaped pattern in which they are no longer significantly lower in the post\u2010restatement period over an average of four quarters. The extent to which the earnings of restatement firms suffer a loss of information content varies across several dimensions. First, the duration of the loss is greater for firms that restate earnings to correct revenue recognition errors and for restatements that result in a large decline in the stock price at the announcement date. Second, there is not a loss in the information content of earnings for firms that make changes to their financial reporting governance structures following restatements. Overall, the evidence in this paper is consistent with a short\u2010term decline in investor confidence regarding financial reporting following restatements, but shows that suspicion regarding the information loss of post\u2010restatement earnings in the long\u2010term is unwarranted.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/2/519/2967/An-Empirical-Analysis-of-the-Decline-in-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These potentially counterintuitive income effects primarily are attributable to incomplete recognition of contemporaneous asset value changes. However, for a substantial majority of downgrade firms we find that recognized asset write\u2010downs exceed unrecognized gains from debt value decreases. This mitigates concerns that income effects from recognizing changes in debt values would be anomalous for such firms.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/3/629/3003/Fair-Value-Accounting-for-Liabilities-and-Own","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting related to credit risk and equity returns without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study extends both areas of research by incorporating R&D tax credits from stock option exercises into the R&D spending decision.

We also test on response mode (estimates in percentages or absolute time units). The results suggest an important trade\u2010off between the level of aggregation and measurement error: increasing aggregation in the definition of activities leads to lower measurement error.

Second, it contributes to the literature on the stock market's use of accounting information by examining immediate and future equity return responses to these components by investors. Finally, it adds to the literature on analysts' processing of accounting information by again testing immediate and delayed response of analysts through contemporaneous forecast revisions as well as future forecast errors. Consistent across both groups of market participants, the results show that the information is useful as evidenced by associations between the DuPont components and stock returns as well as analyst forecast revisions.

This study continues the exploration of honesty in budgeting along two dimensions. First, unlike prior experiments, we measure the incremental effect of honesty by manipulating whether budget requests are made in the form of a factual assertion. Second, prior designs may have emphasized the ethical dimension of budgeting by granting the subordinate wide discretion over setting the budget, whereas we manipulate whether the subordinate or the superior has final authority over setting the budget. We find that less slack is created when budget communication requires a factual assertion in the subordinate authority treatment, but not when the superior has final authority. Hence, we find an incremental effect of honesty only when the subordinate has final authority. We conjecture, and provide some evidence, that this is due to subordinates framing the superior authority situation as one of negotiation where each party acts in his or her self-interest, rather than as an ethical dilemma. This view, that budgeting is essentially devoid of ethical considerations, is consistent with some recent characterizations of budget practices.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/4/1083/3115/The-Effect-of-Honesty-and-Superior-Authority-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['honesty', 'ethical', 'authority']","The article discusses ethical dimensions in budgeting, particularly the role of honesty and authority, but it does not emphasize social justice or critical theory.

Our experimental results show a disordinal interaction between incentive scheme and feedback. Specifically, providing relative performance feedback improves the mean performance of participants compensated under an individual incentive scheme regardless of the precision or specific content of the feedback. In contrast, providing relative performance feedback deteriorates the mean performance of participants compensated under a tournament incentive scheme, but only if the feedback is sufficiently precise. Supplementary analysis suggests that this deterioration in performance is due to ineffective task strategies rather than reduced effort. We also find that in the absence of relative performance feedback, participants compensated under a tournament incentive scheme perform better, and their performance improves to a greater extent over time, compared to participants compensated under an individual incentive scheme.

We propose that the reversed-accruals orientation required in the currently mandated indirect-approach statement of cash flows is unnecessarily complex, causing information-processing problems that result in increased cash flow forecast error and dispersion. We also predict that the mixed pattern (i.e., +/\u2212, \u2212/+) of operating cash flows and operating accruals reported by most companies impedes investors\u2019 ability to learn the time-series properties of cash flows and accruals. We conduct a carefully controlled experiment and find that (1) cash flow forecasts have lower forecast error and dispersion when the indirect-approach statement of cash flows starts with operating cash flows and adds changes in accruals to arrive at net income and (2) cash flow forecasts have lower forecast error and dispersion when the cash flows and accruals are of the same sign (i.e., +/+, \u2212/\u2212); with the sign-based difference attenuated in the forward-oriented statement of cash flows. We also conduct a quasi-experiment to test our mixed-sign versus same-sign hypotheses using archival samples of publicly available I/B/E/S and Value Line cash flow forecasts.

We then examine the extent to which these IT budget levels are related to future firm performance, measured using both broad financial accounting measures, such as operating profit margins and return on assets, and market returns.

We further suggest that IT\u2019s aggregate effect on performance is a weighted average of two very different components: (1) context-driven IT budget levels, which reflect the effects of environmental, organization, and technological factors and the IT budgets resulting from them, and (2) idiosyncratic IT budget levels, which reflect the effect of any marginal firm-specific IT budget expenditures after controlling for these contextual factors.

Based on 289 restatement firms over the period 1997\u20132001, we find that the proportion of CEOs\u2019 compensation in the form of options declines significantly in the two years following the restatement. Furthermore, we document that this reduction is accompanied by a decrease in the riskiness of investments, as reflected in lower stock return volatility and subsequent improvements in operating performance.

With regard to audit fees, we find auditors earn higher fees for IPO engagements than post-IPO engagements.

We posit that the investment opportunity set (IOS) plays a fundamental role in determining whether an industry is an attractive target for auditor specialization. When industry-specific IOS is high, specialist auditors make costly investments in industry-specific knowledge, allowing them to offer a differentiated product and to create entry barriers for other audit firms. When the IOS of firms within an industry is relatively homogeneous, auditors can transfer such knowledge across clients in the industry more easily, resulting in cost savings and scale economies. However, greater homogeneity of IOS in an industry can also increase a client\u2019s aversion to sharing an auditor with its competitors because of concerns about transfers of proprietary information, suggesting that industries with relatively homogeneous IOS are less likely to be dominated by a single auditor. We show that auditor concentration in an industry relates positively to both the level and homogeneity of IOS in the industry, while auditor dominance relates negatively to industry IOS homogeneity. Further, we find that audit fees are positively associated with both levels and homogeneity of industry IOS.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/6/1393/3093/Auditor-Specialization-Auditor-Dominance-and-Audit","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditor specialization and industry concentration without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This study examines the general issue of auditors being \u201csecond movers\u201d by investigating how their awareness of management\u2019s severity classifications of internal control problems influences auditors\u2019 initial assessments of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) under Auditing Standard No. 2.

We further examine whether cognitively restructuring the ICFR assessment task reduces management\u2019s influence on auditors\u2019 judgments by asking auditors to evaluate and explicitly document the likelihood and magnitude of the effect of an ICFR problem on the financial statements.

Many of these studies test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of intentional managerial misreporting but rely on restatement data (such as the GAO database) that contains both irregularities (intentional misstatements) and errors (unintentional misstatements). We argue that researchers can significantly enhance the power of tests related to restatements by distinguishing between errors and irregularities, particularly in recent periods when the relative frequency of error-related restatements is increasing. Based on prior research, the reading of numerous restatement announcements, and the guidance that boards receive from lawyers, auditors, and the SEC on how to respond to suspicions of deliberate misreporting, we propose a straightforward procedure for classifying restatements as either errors or irregularities. We show that most of the restatements we classify as irregularities are followed by fraud-related class action lawsuits as compared to only one lawsuit in the group of restatements classified as errors. As further validation of our proxy, we report that the market reaction to the restatement announcement for our irregularities sample (\u2060\u221214 percent) is also significantly more negative than it is for our errors sample (\u2060\u22122 percent). Finally, we demonstrate the importance of distinguishing errors from irregularities by showing the impact it has on inferences about the relation between restatements and CEO/CFO turnover over time.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/6/1487/3028/The-Importance-of-Distinguishing-Errors-from","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting research related to restatements and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

Moreover, individuals are significant net buyers after both negative and positive extreme earnings surprises, consistent with an attention effect, but not with their trades causing PEAD. Finally, we find no indication that trading by individuals explains the concentration of drift at subsequent earnings announcement dates.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/83/6/1521/3047/Do-Individual-Investors-Cause-Post-Earnings","main articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading behavior and market reactions without addressing any social justice themes, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Seventy-two experienced corporate managers completed a between-participants experiment that randomized monitoring frequency (periodic or continuous) and incentive horizon (short-term or long-term).

The results are consistent with the litigation cost argument for the disclosure of bad news.
