We introduce impression offsetting, an anticipatory impression management technique organizational leaders employ when they expect a focal event will negatively violate the expectations of external stakeholders. Accordingly, in these situations, organizational leaders will announce the focal event contemporaneously with positive, but unrelated information. We predict impression offsetting will generally occur in the context of acquisitions, but also more frequently for specific acquiring firms and acquisitions that are more likely to lead to an expectancy violation. We also posit that offsetting will effectively inhibit observers\u2019 perceptions of events as negative expectancy violations by positively influencing shareholder reactions to acquisition announcements. Consistent with our hypotheses, in a sample of publicly traded acquisition targets, we find evidence for impression offsetting, in which characteristics of both acquirers and their announced acquisitions predict its frequency of use. We also find evidence that impression offsetting is efficacious; on average, it reduces the negative market reaction to acquisition announcements by over 40%, which translates into approximately $246 million in market capitalization.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0288","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of impression management in acquisitions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

How Stakeholders\u2019 Organizational Identification Affects the Role of Reputation Following a Negative Event","Research about the effects of an organization\u2019s general reputation following a negative event remains equivocal: Some studies have found that high reputation is a benefit because of the stock of social capital and goodwill it generates; others have found it to be a burden because of the greater stakeholder attention and violation of expectations associated with a negative event.

We test our hypotheses on a sample of legislative references associated with National Collegiate Athletic Association major infractions from 1999\u20132009. Our results indicate that high reputation is a burden for an organization when considering low-identification stakeholder support: As the number of legislative references increases, a high-reputation university will receive fewer donations from non-alumni donors compared to universities without this asset. In contrast, high reputation is a benefit when considering high-identification stakeholder support: As the number of legislative references increases, a high-reputation university will receive more donations from alumni donors compared to universities without this asset. However, an exploratory investigation reveals that alumni donations to high-reputation universities decline as the number of legislative references increases, suggesting that the benefit of a high reputation has a limit.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0611","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['reputation', 'stakeholders', 'organizational identification']","The article discusses the impact of organizational reputation on stakeholders, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Using data on emerging artists in the field of contemporary art from 2001 to 2010, we investigate the manner in which artists\u2019 audience-specific reputations affect their subsequent success with two distinct audiences: museums and galleries. Our findings suggest that audience-specific reputations have systematically different effects with respect to success with museums and galleries.

In particular, our findings support our predictions that audiences differ from one another in terms of the extent to which other signals (specifically, status and interaction with other audiences) enhance or reduce the value of audience-specific reputations.

However, investors are likely to perceive and evaluate M&As holistically\u2014that is, as complex configurations (i.e., gestalts) of characteristics, rather than as a list of independent factors. And, yet, extant M&A literature has not addressed why and how configurations of factors elicit positive or negative reactions. Overlooking the interdependent nature of factors known to influence acquisition success has limited our understanding of both M&As and investor judgment. Taking an inductive approach to addressing this important issue, the present study relies on fuzzy set methodology. Our results provide compelling evidence that investor perceptions of M&A announcements are not only configurational in nature but also characterized by equifinality (or the presence of multiple paths to success) and asymmetric causality (i.e., configurations that represent bad deals are not simply a mirror image of good deals, but differ fundamentally). By constructing a typology of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d deals as perceived by market participants, we develop a mid-range theory of M&A stock market performance.

To redress this imbalance, the present study focuses on how venture capital (VC) firms\u2019 withdrawals from VC syndicates are associated with their subsequent syndication in the period from 1985 to 2008. We argue that withdrawals disrupt the relationships of the withdrawing VC firms with the coinvestors and reduce the likelihood of them entering into subsequent exchange (relational consequences). Furthermore, public information on the withdrawals can undermine the withdrawing VC firm\u2019s reputation for reliability, making it a less desirable exchange partner overall (global reputational consequences). Finally, we find that abandoned coinvestors can spread negative private information about the withdrawing firm, reducing its chances of syndication with their other network contacts (local reputational consequences). We also show that the global and local reputational consequences attenuate each other, due to redundancy in the content of the information each provides.

We find that certifications are associated with lower turnover rates, and in addition, propose competing crystallization and celebrity hypotheses that model turnover trajectories with repeated certifications, finding diminishing marginal turnover reductions across multiple certifications. We also examine company size and industry job opening moderators, finding that as certifications increase, applicant pool quality is: (1) higher in smaller companies, and (2) higher when job openings are scarcer. Finally, beyond being certified or not, we find supplemental evidence for effects of the specific certification level achieved (e.g., 2nd versus 15th).

Our theoretical framework suggests that journalists who have engaged in negative coverage of a firm\u2019s leadership and strategy are especially likely to experience distancing from other leaders who (a) have friendship ties to the firm\u2019s CEO, (b) are demographically similar to the CEO on salient dimensions, or (c) are socially identified with the CEO as a fellow member of the corporate elite. Our theory and findings ultimately suggest that, due to the multiple sources of social identification between CEOs, journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership tend to experience social distancing from multiple CEOs, and that such distancing has a powerful influence on the valence of journalists\u2019 subsequent reporting about firm leadership and strategy across all the firms they cover.

Moreover, consistent with the idea that a buyer\u2019s own local institutional quality generates a relevant reference point against which sellers are evaluated, we find that a buyer is progressively more likely to contact sellers the higher their local institutional quality relative to the buyer.

In addition, we propose and find an asymmetrical effect of disability incongruence, such that LMX quality is worse in dyads in which the supervisor has a disability than in dyads in which the subordinate has a disability. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of unit-level climate for inclusion on this relationship and find support for a buffering effect of inclusive climates on the negative incongruence-LMX relationship for scenarios in which the supervisor, but not the subordinate, has a disability.

Under uncertainty, acolytes (i.e., subordinates with work connections to high-reputation industry leaders) are likely to benefit in terms of signaling fitness for promotion in the external job market. Analysis of promotion outcomes of coaches in the National Football League over 31 years showed that the acolyte effect was reduced for individuals for whom uncertainty was lowest (acolytes with considerable industry experience or high centrality in the co-worker industry network). There was no support for either a knowledge-transfer or an intrinsic-quality explanation for why acolytes initially gained advantage. Rather, evidence supported the idea that ties to high-reputation leaders were somewhat randomly distributed so that acolytes faced ex post settling-up consequences after their promotions: i.e., fewer further promotions or lateral moves, and more demotions. Thus, acolytes initially benefited from loose linkages between their unobservable quality and signals offered by their industry-leader ties, but also suffered as the unreliability of social network signals became evident. The results suggest that a competitive job market may exhibit self-correction over time.

We build theory about unearned status gain drawing from a qualitative study of 90 U.S.-based employees of a Japanese organization following a company-wide English language mandate. These native English-speaking employees believed that the mandate elevated their worth in the organization, a status gain they attributed to chance, hence deeming it unearned. They also reported a heightened sense of belonging, optimism about career advancement, and access to expanded networks. Yet, among those who interacted regularly with Japanese counterparts, narratives also revealed discomfort, which was manifested in at least two ways.

Moreover, do those evaluations predict how colleagues actually treat employees who volunteer more often? Adopting a reputation perspective, we draw from theories of person perception and attribution to explore these research questions. The results of a field study reveal that colleagues gave credit to employee volunteering when they attributed it to intrinsic reasons and stigmatized employee volunteering when they attributed it to impression management reasons. Ultimately, through the awarded credits, volunteering was rewarded by supervisors (with the allocation of more resources) and coworkers (with the provision of more helping behavior) when it was attributed to intrinsic motives\u2014a relationship that was amplified when stigmas were low and mitigated when stigmas were high.

After compromise with electric utilities and efforts to justify wind power in economic terms failed to reduce the dominance of the economizing logic, SMOs switched tactics to promote the ecologizing logic. Once SMOs succeeded in altering the balance of power in the field, hybrid organizations then emerged to legitimize a new set of frames, practices, and arrangements that integrated the previously incompatible logics. Electric utility firms and policy makers then formalized and embedded the new hybridized logic in the field.

We explain how this pattern of cognition induces genuine positive feelings and admiration for the colleague, such that their interpersonal behaviors are less likely to appear as insincere attempts to curry favor, and thus more likely to engender influence. We further suggest that this pattern of cognition is especially valuable when interacting with relatively high-status colleagues who are demographically dissimilar from the focal actor.

Our empirical analysis of 46 firms from 1978 to 1997, operating within the U.S. medical device and pharmaceutical sectors, demonstrates that while decision makers initiate structural recombination during periods of industry growth (i.e., munificence), they reduce their recombination efforts during periods of industry turbulence (i.e., dynamism), and managerial turbulence (i.e., growth in top management team size). We also find evidence that firms delay realignment and bide their time for better environmental conditions of declining turbulence and industry growth before pursuing more structural realignment.

Using a sample of 524 branches of a U.S. bank, the results largely support the hypotheses as a turnover event leads to an immediate and negative change in branch-level performance. Notably, there is an interaction between manager and employee turnover events that significantly decreases performance. In the recovery period, branches recover more quickly after losing an employee than they do after losing a manager. However, the moderating effect of branch-level interdependence depends on the position, and there is no statistically significant recovery from a manager turnover event within our performance window.

Marines whose leaders were judged by superiors to exhibit charismatic leader behaviors appraised challenge stressors as being more challenging, and were more likely to respond to this appraisal with higher performance. Although charismatic leader behaviors did not influence how hindrance stressors were appraised, they negated the strong negative effect of hindrance appraisals on job performance. In Study 2 (n = 270 U.S. Marines), charismatic leader behaviors were measured through the eyes of the focal Marines, and the interactions found in Study 1 were replicated. Results from multilevel structural equation modeling analyses also indicate that charismatic leader behaviors moderate both the mediating role of challenge appraisals in transmitting the effect of challenge stressors to job performance and the mediating role of hindrance appraisals in transmitting the effect of hindrance stressors to job performance.

Our setting is three professional service firms, where we examine changes in relations of recently promoted service professionals (auditors, consultants, and lawyers). We take a comprehensive look at the drivers of two forms of network changes: tie loss and tie gain. Looking backward, we examine the characteristics of the contact, the relationship, and social structure and identify which forces are at play in losing ties, revealing an overarching tendency for both cohesion and efficiency forces to play a role. Looking forward, we identify the effect of previous network structures that act as a \u201cshadow of the past\u201d and impact the quality of newly gained relations during the role transitions.

In this study, we begin to unpack the micro-foundations of firm-specific human capital by theoretically and empirically exploring when employees perceive their skills to be firm-specific. We first develop theoretical arguments and hypotheses based on the extant strategy literature, which implicitly assumes information efficiency and unbiased perceptions of firm-specificity. We then relax these assumptions and develop alternative hypotheses rooted in the cognitive psychology literature, which highlights biases in human judgment. We test our hypotheses using two data sources from Korea and the United States. Surprisingly, our results support the hypotheses based on cognitive bias\u2014a stark contrast to expectations embedded within the strategy literature. Specifically, we find organizational commitment and, to some extent, tenure are negatively related to employee perceptions of the firm-specificity. We also find that employer-provided on-the-job training is unrelated to perceived firm-specificity. These results suggest that firm-specific human capital, as perceived by employees, may drive behavior in ways unanticipated by existing theory\u2014for example, with respect to investments in skills or turnover decisions. This, in turn, may challenge the assumed relationship between firm-specific human capital and sustained competitive advantage. More broadly, our findings may suggest a need to reconsider other theories, such as transaction cost economics, that draw heavily on firm-specificity and implicitly assume widely shared and unbiased perceptions.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0286","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['biases', 'perceptions', 'commitment']","The article discusses cognitive biases in employee perceptions, which touches on themes of fairness and subjective experiences in the workplace.

Evidence from the early U.S. auto industry indicates that employee spinoffs generated from incumbents that had integrated a key value chain activity were also more likely to integrate that activity than other entrants, which, we suggest, reflects the application of knowledge inheritance relative to that activity.

Accordingly, we advance and test a multi-level model of empowerment which seeks to better understand the unique and synergistic effects between unit and individual empowerment in hospital units. Analysis of data involving 544 individuals in 78 units, collected from multiple sources over three different time periods, revealed that unit empowerment evidenced a synergistic interaction with individual-level psychological empowerment as related to individuals\u2019 job performance, as well as an indirect effect on performance via individual empowerment, while controlling for previous performance levels. Notably, these effects were significant at relatively high, but not at relatively low, levels of unit empowerment.

While multidisciplinary teams are critical for knowledge creation in increasingly specialized work environments, the coordination literature has been divided with respect to the extent to which such teams rely on formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. Our findings show that when interdependencies among knowledge domains are dynamic and unpredictable, specialists design self-managed (sub-)teams around collectively held assumptions about interdependencies based on incomplete information (conjectural interdependencies). These team structures establish the grounds for informal coordination practices that enable specialists to both manage known interdependencies and reveal new interdependencies. Newly revealed interdependencies among knowledge domains, in turn, promote structural adaptation.

However, upon considering how justice behaviors influence subordinates\u2019 cognitive processes, we predict that interpersonal justice has a surprising, unintended negative consequence. Supervisors who violate interpersonal justice rules trigger subordinates to search for reasons why their supervisors are threatening them, causing subordinates to be more attuned to supervisors\u2019 individual characteristics and therefore unlikely to use stereotypes when evaluating them. In contrast, supervisors who adhere to interpersonal justice rules allow subordinates to divert attention away from them, leading subordinates\u2019 judgments of their supervisors to be influenced by stereotypes. Consistent with these predictions, using field data we found that minority supervisors faced bias relative to Caucasian supervisors when supervisors adhered to\u2014but not when they violated\u2014interpersonal justice rules. We replicated this effect in an experiment and established that it is explained by an alternating pattern of stereotype application and inhibition: the stereotype that minority supervisors are more deceitful than Caucasians influenced fairness judgments when supervisors adhered to\u2014but not when they violated\u2014interpersonal justice rules.

Whereas prevailing conceptualizations of hierarchy in the group and organization literature have focused on inequality in member power or status (i.e., centralization or steepness), we build on the ethological and social network traditions to advance a view of hierarchy as cascading relations of dyadic influence (i.e., acyclicity). We suggest that hierarchy thus conceptualized is more likely to capture the functional benefits of hierarchy, whereas hierarchy as inequality is more likely to be dysfunctional. In a study of 75 teams drawn from a range of industries, we show that whereas acyclicity in influence relations reduces conflict and thereby enhances both group performance and member satisfaction, centralization and steepness have negative effects on conflict, performance, and satisfaction, particularly in groups that perform complex tasks.

Four experiments showed that individuals with a creative identity reported higher psychological entitlement and engaged in more unethical behaviors. Additionally, when participants believed that their creativity was rare rather than common, they were more likely to lie for money. Moreover, manipulation of the rarity of creative identity, but not of practical identity, increased psychological entitlement and unethical acts. We tested for the mediating effect of psychological entitlement on dishonesty using both measurement of mediation and experimental causal chain approaches. We further provide evidence from organizations. Responses from a sample of supervisor\u2013subordinate dyads demonstrated that employees reporting strong creative identities who perceived creativity as rare in their work group, rather than common, were rated as engaging in more unethical behaviors by their supervisors. This paper extends prior theory on negative moral consequences of creativity by shedding new light on assumptions regarding the prevalence of creativity and the role psychological entitlement plays.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.1109","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['entitlement', 'unethical behaviors', 'creative identity']","The article discusses the relationship between creative identity and unethical behaviors, touching on themes of entitlement and morality.

Signaling Interactions in New Venture Pursuit of Initial External Capital","After new ventures have exhausted the limited financial resources of founders, family, and friends, they often pursue initial external capital. To secure investment, entrepreneurs can signal about their venture\u2019s latent potential by aligning themselves with reliable third parties. Such affiliations affirm the new venture\u2019s legitimacy and provide substantive benefits in the form of mentoring, access to resources, and ongoing monitoring. However, early stage financing is an especially \u201cnoisy\u201d signaling environment owing to the large number of startups seeking funding, many of which will not survive. The real value of third-party affiliations in this context resides in their ability to unlock the potential of other more pedestrian signals, such as the entrepreneur\u2019s characteristics and actions that might otherwise go unnoticed. We borrow from the sensemaking literature to explain how third-party affiliation signals disambiguate signals with multiple possible interpretations so that potential investors interpret them positively. Findings support our theory that a startup\u2019s characteristics and actions are signals that remain relatively unnoticed unless a startup combines them with a third-party affiliation that enhances the signal\u2019s value, thus increasing the likelihood of receiving external capital.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0100","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['signaling', 'third-party affiliation', 'legitimacy']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of securing external capital for startups, with minimal emphasis on socially progressive themes.

A Bounded Rationality Perspective","There has been substantial research on the value of young firms engaging high-quality partners. This literature, as well as the broader firm reputation literature, has tended to assume that individuals leading such firms find it relatively easy to accurately assess potential partner quality as reflected in their track record of past performance and behavior. Yet this prior work has largely focused on information-rich environments where potential partners are generally large and receive substantial public attention, and with whom evaluators may have high familiarity. In contrast, we draw on bounded rationality to theorize about how in information-sparse environments, individuals may misperceive the quality indicated by a firm\u2019s objective track record. We argue that accurate evaluations depend not only on individuals\u2019 motivation and ability to access information but on the convergence of these factors with attributes of the potential partner being evaluated. We test and find support for our framework using a novel dataset of 1,278 ratings of the quality of 153 early-stage venture capital firms by entrepreneurs that approached these firms for investments. Overall, this paper extends understanding of firm reputation dynamics to information-sparse contexts, and explores why individuals such as entrepreneurs may at times have difficulty accurately evaluating partners.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0316","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['evaluation', 'entrepreneurs', 'venture capital', 'track record']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of evaluating venture capital firms and does not engage with themes of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Our two-study examination of a cross-domain antecedent of abusive supervision stands in contrast to prior research, which has focused primarily on work-related factors that influence abusive supervision. Further, our investigation shows how ego depletion is proximally related to abusive supervision. In the first study, conducted at a Fortune 500 company and designed as a lagged survey study, we found that, after controlling for alternative theoretical mechanisms, supervisors who experienced FWC displayed more abusive behaviors toward subordinates, and that this relationship was stronger for female supervisors and for supervisors who operated in environments with greater situation control. These results were then replicated and expanded in an experience sampling study using a multi-organization sample of supervisors. This allowed us to study the FWC\u2013abusive supervision relationship as it emerged on a day-to-day basis and to examine ego depletion as an explanatory mechanism. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that FWC was associated with abusive supervision, ego depletion acted as a mediator of the FWC\u2013abusive supervision relationship, and that gender and situation control served as moderators.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.1009","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['abusive supervision', 'gender', 'family-work conflict']","The article discusses abusive supervision and highlights the role of gender in this context, indicating a moderate focus on social issues within organizational behavior.

In recent years, this old question has attracted new answers\u2014albeit partial ones.

This mixed methods study uses fuzzy-set analyses of defense firms\u2019 responses to 9/11 to model the two perspectives as potentially competing or complementary, while our findings suggest that neither dynamic capabilities nor superior cognition must be present for firms to adapt.

Using insights from organizational behavior research, we argue that horizontal coordination between component teams can benefit if a multiteam system is composed of generalist members who are acquainted with the multiple functions present in the overall system (i.e., high intrapersonal functional diversity [IFD]). At the same time, however, such IFD may have detrimental side effects because generalists\u2019 broad focus may distract them from high-impact, specialized activities (i.e., aspirational behavior). Building on insights from organization theory, we propose that coordination across a multiteam system\u2019s hierarchical layers (i.e., vertical coordinated action between a team tasked with system-wide integration and task-specialized component teams) is critical for reaping IFD\u2019s benefits while avoiding its costs.

We also explore the psychological underpinnings of rivalry in order to illuminate how it differs from general competition and why it increases unethical behavior. The data reveal a serial mediation pathway whereby rivalry heightens the psychological stakes of competition (by increasing actors\u2019 contingency of self-worth and status concerns), which leads to the adoption of a stronger performance-approach orientation, which then increases unethical behavior. These findings highlight the importance of rivalry as a widespread, powerful, yet largely unstudied phenomenon with significant organizational implications.

We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization\u2019s 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for \u201cneglected diseases\u201d such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases. We call for the application of management theories to grand challenges, and to the evaluation of policies such as TRIPS.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0641","special research forum","AMJ","Management & Organizations","8","['poor', 'neglected diseases', 'basic science', 'TRIPS', 'health care']","The article addresses significant social issues related to health care for impoverished populations and critiques existing policies that disproportionately affect low-income countries.

Drawing on research on the psychological effects of income, social learning theory, and the integrative trait-behavioral model of leadership effectiveness, we propose a negative, serially mediated association between higher parental income and lower future leader effectiveness via high levels of narcissism and, in turn, reduced engagement in behaviors that are viewed as central to the leadership role. We test our model using multisource data collected from active soldiers in the United States Army. Results reveal that parental income exerts indirect effects on leadership effectiveness criteria because (a) parental income is positively related to narcissism as an adult, (b) narcissism relates negatively to engaging in task-, relational-, and change-oriented leadership behaviors, and (c) reduced engagement in these behaviors relates to lower leader effectiveness.

Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation\u2019s microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

Through this analysis, we move beyond conventional thinking on unintended consequences proposed in classic studies on organizations, complement contemporary research about how organizations effect positive social change by pursuing multiple goals, and develop portable insights for organizational efforts in tackling inequality.

Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program.

To test our framework, we build a large and unique seven-year panel dataset consisting of data from 245 U.S. communities. We find that increasing the number of welfare nonprofits is beneficial for reducing community inequality, but only up to a point, after which resource competition decreases their effectiveness. This competition for resources is also present when a high density of elite-oriented nonprofits operates in the same community. Hypotheses focused on the institutional dimension receive mixed support. As predicted, welfare nonprofits are more effective when they operate in communities with strong law enforcement capabilities and less effective in politically conservative local contexts. Contrary to our expectations, however, we find that welfare nonprofits are less effective in demographically heterogeneous local contexts and when the government provides effective social policies, thus indicating a possible substitution effect. Surprisingly, nonprofit effectiveness is increased in highly financialized local contexts.

We argue that severance agreements have potential value as both an executive recruitment and a governance tool but that the way they are conventionally structured undermines the value shareholders realize from them. The implications of structure have been almost entirely overlooked by scholars, perhaps because the influence of compensation consultants has left little variance in how severance agreements are implemented across firms. We address this gap by theorizing about how severance agreements could be structured to effectively generate value for executives and shareholders. To do this, we introduce a categorization of key dimensions of CEO severance agreements and consider how each of these dimensions can be structured to facilitate CEO recruitment while simultaneously mitigating future governance problems.

However, when an augmented bounded rationality assumption is incorporated into transaction cost economics, we argue, first, that bounded rationality is a separate source of transaction costs and, second, that these costs are not equally mitigated by all forms of hierarchy. Instead, different hierarchical forms are associated with particular frames and social referents that naturally enhance specific bounded rationality\u2013based conflicts, allowing certain hierarchical forms to mitigate bounded rationality\u2013based transaction costs better than others.

We use this model to describe how the communicative practices of decision makers both enable and constrain how actors manage the risk and uncertainty of their judgments and decisions within an institutional context. We first develop a dual conception of reason as both communication (public argument) and cognition (private argument). With this dual conception of reason, we conceptualize actors as active and passive speakers and listeners who interpret, produce, and present public and private arguments to persuade themselves and others to adopt, maintain, or reject practices. Speakers and listeners have cognitive limits and thus create presumptions or shared decision-making rules to help them efficiently produce and process the arguments needed to debate, evaluate, and adjudicate recurring institutional decisions. We suggest that arguments shape actors\u2019 reasoning and judgment because they reflect appeals to pathos (emotion), logos (logic), and ethos (values) that support or criticize decisions to act.

We combine empirical analyses of existing interorganizational networks in six industries with an agent-based simulation model of network emergence. Using data on technology partnerships from 1983 to 1999 between firms in the automotive, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, microelectronics, new materials, and telecommunications industries, we find that differences in technological dynamism across industries and the concomitant demands for value creation engender variations in firms\u2019 collaborative behaviors. On average, firms in technologically dynamic industries pursue more-open ego networks, which fosters access to new and diverse resources that help sustain continuous innovation. In contrast, firms in technologically stable industries on average pursue more-closed ego networks, which fosters reliable collaboration and helps preserve existing resources. We show that because of the observed cross-industry differences in firms\u2019 collaborative behaviors, the emergent industry-wide networks take on distinct structural forms. Technologically stable industries feature clan networks, characterized by low network connectedness and rather strong community structures. Technologically dynamic industries feature community networks, characterized by high network connectedness and medium-to-strong community structures. Convention networks, which feature high network connectedness and weak community structures, were not evident among the empirical networks we examined.

We argue, in contrast, that a specialist discount may occur in contexts that share three features: strong institutionalized mechanisms, candidate profiles with direct investments that signal their value, and a high supply of focused candidates relative to demand. We then test whether there is a specialist discount for graduating elite MBAs, as it is a labor market that exemplifies these conditions under which we expect specialists to be penalized. Using rich data on two graduating cohorts from a top-tier U.S. business school, we show that elite MBA graduates who established a focused (specialized) market profile of experiences relating to investment banking before and during the program were less likely to receive multiple job offers and were offered less in starting-bonus compensation than similar MBA candidates with no exposure or less-focused exposure to investment banking.

Female workers were disproportionately allocated to the pat-down task, the manual screening of travelers for prohibited items. Our findings suggest that this segregation led to overall poorer job quality outcomes for women. Task segregation overexposed female workers to processes of physical exertion, emotional labor, and relational strain, giving rise to work intensity, emotional exhaustion, and lack of coping resources. Task segregation also seemed to disproportionately expose female workers to managerial sanctions for taking recuperative time off and a narrowing of their skill set that may have contributed to worse promotion chances, pay, satisfaction, and turnover rates for women.

Prior studies have found that managers who form close interpersonal relationships with clients can stabilize market ties, but these relationships can also be a source of increased market tie dissolution in the event of an exchange manager\u2019s departure from the firm. Using data on all state-level lobbyists and clients in the Texas lobbying industry from 2001 to 2009, we confirm that a client is more likely to remain with a firm than to follow a departing manager to a new firm, but the depth, focus, and shared ownership of a manager\u2019s client relationship moderate the impact of his or her mobility on market tie dissolution. We find that the tenure of the relationship with a manager, the number of clients on a manager\u2019s roster, the level of attention received from a manager, and the presence of an additional manager relationship at the same firm all influence where a client places its business when a manager departs. Our results suggest that embeddedness explanations strongly predict interpersonal market tie dissolution when managers are stationary but lose their predictive power when managers move to new firms. We propose that an alternative logic of interorganizational market ties, based on power and resource dependence, may be at play in such situations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839215619198","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['embeddedness', 'relationships', 'interorganizational', 'mobility']","The article discusses relational embeddedness and its impact on market ties, which touches on interpersonal relationships in a business context.

We predict, counter to current status theory and aligned with performance feedback theory, that a status decline prompts certain organizations to charge higher prices and that there are two kinds of organizations most prone to make such price increases: those with broad appeal across disconnected types of customers and those whose most strategically similar rivals have charged high prices previously. Using panel data from U.S. News & World Report\u2019s annual rankings of private colleges and universities from 2005 to 2012, we model the effect of drops in rank that take a school below an aspiration level. We find that schools set tuition higher after a sharp decline in rank, particularly those that appeal widely to college applicants and whose rivals are relatively more expensive. This study presents a dynamic conception of status that differs from the prevailing view of status as a stable asset that yields concrete benefits. In contrast to past work that has assumed that organizations passively experience negative effects when their status falls, our results show that organizations actively respond to status loss. Status is a performance-related goal for such producers, who may increase prices as they work to recover lost ground after a status decline.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839216629671","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['status', 'price-setting', 'aspiration']","The article primarily focuses on pricing strategies in higher education and does not engage with themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

Over three decades, Alessi developed three different strategies to combine normative elements of the two logics, using each strategy to envision and pursue different market opportunities. By combining the logics of industrial manufacturing and cultural production, Alessi was able to envision new possibilities for value creation and to enact them through innovation in product design. The three strategies triggered a common set of mechanisms through which the purposeful combining of logics enabled the pursuit of opportunity, while each strategy structured the process differently. We develop a theoretical model linking the development of recombinant strategies to the dynamic restructuring of organizational agency and the related capacity to create and pursue new market opportunities.

Results show that when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little r\u00e9sum\u00e9 whitening and thus submit more racially transparent r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.

Using both a field study of 339 professionals in the circus arts industry and a lab experiment, I examine the conditions for accurate creative forecasting, focusing on the effect of creators\u2019 and managers\u2019 roles.

Analyzing 42 projects in two time periods that required collaboration between engineering and marketing during such a shift, we show how cross-occupational collaboration under these conditions can be facilitated by a radical flank threat, through which the bargaining power of moderates is strengthened by the presence of a more-radical group. In the face of a strong threat by radical members of a challenger occupational group, moderate members of the dominant engineering group may change their perceptions of their power to resist challengers\u2019 demands and begin to distinguish between the goals of radical versus more-moderate challengers.

Groups that used the collaborative forms of independent parallel dyads or single unified triads generated mistrust and conflict that stemmed from expectations about third-party participation and overlapping roles and thus had low innovation performance and weaker ties. Other groups avoided these problems by using a dynamic collaboration process that I call \u201cgroup cycling,\u201d in which managers viewed their triad as a small group, decomposed innovative activities into a series of interlinked dyads between different pairs of partners, and managed third-party interests across time.

Drawing on participant observation of an initiative to improve perioperative efficiency in seven Ontario hospitals, we find that organizational roles shape selection by influencing both politics and frames in organizational search. Roles shape politics by defining the role-specific goals of the people who have authority to change a routine. Organizations will not select a routine for change unless at least some elites\u2014people with role-based authority\u2014frame the existing routine as negatively affecting their role-specific goals. Roles also shape individuals\u2019 frames. Because people are only partially exposed to interdependencies between routines in their day-to-day work, they may not be fully aware of the diverse impact that an existing routine can have on their goals.

These novel sociotechnical arrangements afford finely-grained manipulation of how tasks can be represented and have changed the way organizations ideate. In this paper, we investigate differences in behavioral decision-making resulting from IT-based support of open idea evaluation. We report results from a randomized experiment of 120 participants comparing IT-based decision-making support using a rating scale (representing a judgment task) and a preference market (representing a choice task). We find that the rating scale-based task invokes significantly higher perceived ease of use than the preference market-based task and that perceived ease of use mediates the effect of the task representation treatment on the users\u2019 decision quality. Furthermore, we find that the understandability of ideas being evaluated, which we assess through the ideas\u2019 readability, and the perception of the task\u2019s variability moderate the strength of this mediation effect, which becomes stronger with increasing perceived task variability and decreasing understandability of the ideas. We contribute to the literature by explaining how perceptual differences of task representations for open idea evaluation affect the decision quality of users and translate into differences in mechanism accuracy. These results enhance our understanding of how crowdsourcing as a novel mode of value creation may effectively complement traditional work structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0605","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['collaboration', 'decision-making', 'sociotechnical']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and idea evaluation in open sourcing, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

BD auctions in online labor markets either follow an open or a sealed bid format. We compare open and sealed bid auctions in online labor markets to identify which format is superior in terms of obtaining more bids and a higher buyer surplus. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the relative advantage of open versus sealed bid auctions hinges on the role of reducing service providers\u2019 valuation uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the cost to execute a project) and competition uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the intensity of the competition from other service providers), which largely depend on the relative importance of the common value (versus the private value) component of the auctioned IT services, calling for an empirical investigation to compare open and sealed bid auctions. Based on a unique data set of 71,437 open bid auctions and 7,499 sealed bid auctions posted by 21,799 buyers at a leading online labor market, we find that, on average, although sealed bid auctions attract 18.4% more bids, open bid auctions offer buyers $10.87 higher surplus. Furthermore, open bid auctions are 55.3% more likely to result in a buyer\u2019s selection of a certain service provider and 22.1% more likely to reach a contract (conditional on the buyer\u2019s making a selection) with a provider, and they generate higher buyer satisfaction. In contrast to conventional wisdom that \u201cthe more bids the better\u201d and industry practice of treating sealed bid auctions as a premium feature, our results suggest that the buyer surplus gained from the reduction in valuation uncertainty enabled by open bid auctions outweighs the buyer surplus gained from the higher competition uncertainty in sealed bid auctions, which renders open bid auctions a superior auction design in online labor markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0606","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of auction formats in online labor markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The information security domain is characterized by multiple intertwined security controls, not all of which can be regulated by standards, but compliance with existing security standards is often used by firms to deflect liability if a security breach occurs. We analyze a stylized setting where a firm has two security controls that are linked in either a serial or a parallel configuration. One control is directly regulated by a security standard, whereas the other one is not. We show that a higher security standard does not necessarily lead to a higher firm security. Furthermore, the conditions under which a higher standard hurts the firm security are sharply different in the two\u2014serial and parallel\u2014configurations. If standard compliance leads to reduced liability for a firm following a breach, such liability reduction in turn weakens the tie between the standard and firm security. Under a setting in which the firm meets the optimal standard set by a policy maker, both firm security and social welfare are higher when the damage to the firm following a breach takes a higher share of the total damage to social welfare, and also when the firm takes a larger share of liability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0607","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['security standards', 'liability', 'social welfare']","The article discusses security standards and their implications for firm liability and social welfare, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Using data on 109 U.S. firms for the 1994\u20131996 and 1999\u20132006 periods, we find that aggregate IT investments have a positive association with customer satisfaction.

Specifically, IT investments had a more positive influence on customer satisfaction for the 1994\u20131996 period than for the 1999\u20132006 period. Conversely, IT investments had a positive effect on profits in the 1999\u20132006 period, but a negative effect in the 1994\u20131996 period.

Although previous research finds that trust in technology can predict important outcomes, little research has examined the effect of unmet trust in technology expectations on trusting intentions. Furthermore, both trust and expectation disconfirmation theories suggest that trust disconfirmation effects may be more complex than the linear expectation disconfirmation model depicts. However, this complexity may only exist under certain contextual conditions. The current study contributes to this literature by introducing a nonlinear expectation disconfirmation theory model that extends understanding of trust-in-technology expectations and disconfirmation. Not only does the model include both technology trust expectations and technology trusting intention, it also introduces the concept of expectation maturity as a contextual factor. We collected data from three technology usage contexts that differ in expectation maturity, which we operationalize as length of the introductory period. We find that the situation, in terms of expectation maturity, consistently matters. Using polynomial regression and response surface analyses, we find that in contexts with a longer introductory period (i.e., higher expectation maturity), disconfirmation has a nonlinear relationship with trusting intention. When the introductory period is shorter (i.e., expectation maturity is lower), disconfirmation has a linear relationship with trusting intention. This unique set of empirical findings shows when it is valuable to use nonlinear modeling for understanding technology trust disconfirmation. We conclude with implications for future research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0611","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['trust', 'technology', 'expectation']","The article focuses on technical aspects of trust in technology without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical implications.

We tested our model with 4,430 Hong Kong citizens\u2019 reactions to two e-government services: government websites and online appointment booking.

We consider a mobile Internet platform that has evolved over several generations and for which users download complementary services from third-party providers. These services are often intergenerational: newer platform generations are backward compatible with respect to services released under earlier generation platforms. In this paper, we propose a model to identify the main drivers of consumers\u2019 choice of platform generation, accounting for (i) the migration from older to newer platform generations, (ii) the indirect network effect on platform adoption due to same-generation services, and (iii) the effect on platform adoption due to the consumption of intergenerational services via backward compatibility. Using data on mobile Internet platform adoption and services consumption for the time period of 2001\u20132007 from a major wireless carrier in an Asian country, we estimate the three effects noted above. We show that both the migration from older to newer platform generations and the indirect network effects are significant. The surprising finding is that intergenerational services that connect subsequent generations of platforms essentially engender backward compatibility with two opposing effects. Whereas an intergenerational service may accelerate the migration to the subsequent platform generations, it may also, perhaps unintentionally, provide a fresh lease on life for earlier generation platforms due to the continued use of earlier generation services on newer platform generations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0615","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of platform adoption and backward compatibility without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An Empirical Investigation of Confirmation Bias in Online Word of Mouth","In the online word-of-mouth literature, research has consistently shown that negative reviews have a greater impact on product sales than positive reviews. Although this negativity effect is well documented at the product level, there is less consensus on whether negative or positive reviews are perceived to be more helpful by consumers. A limited number of studies document a higher perceived helpfulness for negative reviews under certain conditions, but accumulating empirical evidence suggests the opposite. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we propose that consumers can form initial beliefs about a product on the basis of the product\u2019s summary rating statistics (such as the average and dispersion of the product\u2019s ratings) and that these initial beliefs play a vital role in their subsequent evaluation of individual reviews. Using a unique panel data set collected from Apple\u2019s App Store, we empirically demonstrate confirmation bias\u2014that consumers have a tendency to perceive reviews that confirm (versus disconfirm) their initial beliefs as more helpful, and that this tendency is moderated by their confidence in their initial beliefs. Furthermore, we show that confirmation bias can lead to greater perceived helpfulness for positive reviews (positivity effect) when the average product rating is high, and for negative reviews (negativity effect) when the average product rating is low. Thus, the mixed findings in the literature can be a consequence of confirmation bias. This paper is among the first to incorporate the important role of consumers\u2019 initial beliefs and confidence in such beliefs (a fundamental dimension of metacognition) into their evaluation of online reviews, and our findings have significant implications for researchers, retailers, and review websites.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2015.0617","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and confirmation bias in online reviews without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Interestingly, we find that the effects of the use of enterprise applications materialize after two years, whereas the effects of the use of Web applications are realized in the current year. We also examine whether the role of IT use in firm-level employment are moderated by firm size, average wage rate, and industry technology intensity. The long-term effects of the use of enterprise applications on firm-level employment are more pronounced in larger firms, with higher average wages, and in high-technology industries. The results are robust to alternative specifications and tests that address causality and endogeneity concerns.

Using novel measures of product market competition based on product descriptions from firm 10-K statements and accounting for potential endogeneity, we investigate how product market competition between 1997 and 2007 relates to the magnitude of CVC spending. We first find that firms in competitive markets make higher research and development (R&D) and CVC investments. In addition, we find that increasing product market competition leads to a shift away from internal R&D spending and into CVC. These movements are significantly stronger for technology leaders, i.e., firms with deep patent stocks, in the IT industry. We also find that CVC appears to be an effective way of exploiting external knowledge for technology leaders in the IT-producing industry, but not for technology slow starters. CVC investments lead to significantly more patent applications for technology leaders but no appreciable difference for slow starters. Our results provide new insights for theories of innovation in competitive, dynamic markets, potentially as part of a portfolio that includes internal R&D as well as open innovation models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0620","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate venture capital and product market competition without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although the extant literature has studied firm level strategic responses to consumer heterogeneity and piracy, there is a lack of understanding of consumer reactions to digital goods choice sets that include firm product extensions such as the introduction of premium or free alternatives. With context-dependent preferences as the theoretical basis, this study systematically examines the impact of piracy controls and product line extensions on welfare in a consumer software market context (i.e., willingness to pay (WTP) and changes in consumer and producer surplus). In two controlled experiments using double-bound-dichotomous-choice WTP elicitation, we investigate how piracy controls and product line extensions impact two different platforms of the same software (PC Adobe applications and mobile Adobe applications) in terms of propensity to pirate and WTP. We show that introducing a premium or free vertical extension has different impacts on consumers\u2019 WTP for the focal product depending on whether it is a low-cost or high-cost market even when controlling for individual differences, such as price fairness perceptions, product feature value, brand perceptions, etc. By contrast, piracy controls reduce piracy rates but have a limited impact on consumer WTP for the focal product in both contexts. By calculating the overall welfare of the market, we show that there is alignment in consumer and producer interests at current and estimated optimal price levels in both high-cost and low-cost markets. However, the introduction of a free product extension leads to a higher surplus in the high-cost market, whereas the introduction of the premium product extension leads to a higher surplus in the low-cost market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0621","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on market dynamics, consumer behavior, and economic welfare without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We draw on an in-depth interpretive study of how two innovation consulting firms encountered crowdsourcing for innovation. Our findings suggest that, although both organizations relied on a similar set of organizational arrangements in their daily consulting work, they enacted different positions vis-\u00e0-vis crowdsourcing: one firm further experimented with it, whereas the other rejected it altogether. These different positions emerged as organizational actors examined, framed, and evaluated crowdsourcing as an alternative for generating knowledge. To interpret these findings, we draw on philosophy of science and develop the concept of organizationalepistemic stance, defined as an attitude that organizational actors collectively enact in pursuing knowledge. Our analysis suggests that when organizational actors encounter and explore information technology-enabled practices, such as crowdsourcing and big data analytics, they are likely to remain committed to their epistemic stance to frame such practices and judge their potential value for pursuing knowledge. This paper contributes to our understanding of encounters with, and adoption and diffusion of, new organizational practices and offers new ways of thinking about crowdsourcing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0623","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['innovation', 'crowdsourcing', 'knowledge']","The article discusses innovation and knowledge generation, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

However, the phenomenon has yet to be studied in combinatorial auctions, which are a type of multiobject auction that allows bidders to bid on a set of objects. Such auctions have been found to be beneficial when objects exhibit synergy, e.g., are complementary. In this paper, we explore jump bidding behavior in combinatorial auctions as a function of design choices of the mechanism. In particular, we examine the effects of price revelation schemes on the nature and extent of jump bidding. Furthermore, we study the effects of jump bidding on the economic performance of the auctions. To conduct our study, first, we develop hypotheses using auction theories and behavioral theories of how people use reference prices as anchors, and second, we conduct a laboratory experiment to test our hypotheses and examine bidder behavior. We find that the nature of the prices that the auctioneer chooses to offer as feedback to the bidders can considerably influence their jump bidding behavior, leading to significant differences in auction outcomes. We demonstrate that in combinatorial auctions, in addition to the theories of jump bidding proposed in the literature, bounded rationality of the bidders plays a part in the nature and extent of jump bidding. Our study reveals that in the cognitively challenging package-bidding environment, bidders often pursue computationally frugal but suboptimal heuristics. Our results have important policy implications for mechanism designers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0624","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of jump bidding in combinatorial auctions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

After the commercialization of the Internet, an industry\u2019s own IT investment and outsourced logistics became complements, whereas they were not before.

We first examine how heterogeneity among healthcare practitioners (HPs) (in terms of their expected benefit from the HIE membership) affects participation of HPs in HIEs. We find that, under certain conditions, low-gain HPs choose not to join HIEs. Hence, we explore several measures that can encourage more participation in these networks and find that it might be beneficial to (i) establish a second HIE in the region, (ii) propose more value to the low-gain HPs, or (iii) offer or incentivize value-added services. We present several other interesting and useful results that are somewhat counterintuitive. For example, increasing the highest benefit the HPs can get from the HIE might decrease the number of HPs that want to join the HIE. Furthermore, since the amount of funds from the government and the other agencies often changes (and will eventually cease), we analyze how the changes in the benefit HPs obtain from the HIE affect (i) participation in the network, (ii) the HIE subscription fee and the fee for value-added service, (iii) the number of HPs that request value-added service, and (iv) the net values of the HIE provider and HPs.

Yet there is hardly any information on how to adapt game design elements to improve learning outcomes and promote learner engagement. To address this issue, we focus on a popular game design element, competition, and specifically examine the effects of different competitive structures, i.e., whether a person faces a higher-skilled, lower-skilled or equally-skilled competitor, on learning and engagement. We study a gamified training design for databases, where trainees play a trivia-based mini-game with a competitor after each e-training module. Trainees who faced a lower-skilled competitor reported higher self-efficacy beliefs and better learning outcomes, supporting the effect of peer appraisal, a less examined aspect of social cognitive theory. Yet trainees who faced equally-skilled competitors reported higher levels of engagement, supporting the balance principle of flow theory. Our study findings indicate that no one competitive structure can simultaneously address learning and engagement outcomes. The choice of competitive structures depends on the priority of the outcomes in training. Our findings provide one explanation for the mixed findings on the effect of competitive gamification designs in technology mediated training.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0630","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['engagement', 'learning outcomes', 'competition']","The article primarily focuses on gamification in training and its effects on learning outcomes, with no significant emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Such models are created using a conceptual-modeling (CM) grammar. Just as high-quality conceptual models facilitate high-quality systems development, high-quality CM grammars facilitate high-quality CM. This paper provides a new perspective on ways to improve the quality of the semantics of CM grammars. For many years, the leading approach to this topic has relied on ontological theory. We show, however, that the ontological approach captures only half the story; it needs to be coupled with a logical approach. We explain how the ontological and logical qualities of CM grammars interrelate. Furthermore, we outline three contributions of a logical approach to evaluating the quality of CM grammars: a means of seeing some familiar CM problems in simpler ways, illumination of new problems, and proving the benefit of modifying existing CM grammars in particular ways. We demonstrate these benefits in the context of the Entity-Relationship grammar.

Efficacy of leadership style in OCWCs is greatly influenced by environmental conditions. DLMX is more effective in sustaining member commitment under high environmental uncertainty, regardless of network size and structure. ULMX is more effective in decentralized structures and during the early stage of community growth. The simulation-based insights suggest that supervisory behavior does matter to member retention and sustained participation in OCWCs, but its impact is significantly moderated by many contextual factors, such as community size, structure, maturity, and environmental uncertainty. In certain situations ULMX prevails, but in others DLMX is more effective. These two forms of governance in fact complement each other, rather than being mutually exclusive forms of leadership style. To attain a maximal outcome, leaders should flexibly adapt their governance styles between DLMX and ULMX over the life cycle of an OCWC to maximize member retention and performance benefits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0632","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['leadership', 'participation', 'collaborative']","The article discusses leadership styles and their impact on member participation in collaborative work communities, which touches on themes of governance and member engagement.

They must also continue to behave securely. Positive outcomes of secure behavior may encourage the continuance of that behavior, whereas negative outcomes may lead users to adopt less-secure behaviors. For example, in the context of authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). Authentication is a particularly interesting security behavior for information systems researchers to study because it is affected by an IT artifact (the design of the user interface). Laptops and desktop computers use full-size physical keyboards. However, users are increasingly adopting mobile devices, which provide either miniature physical keypads or touchscreens for entering authentication credentials. The difference in interface design affects the ease of correctly entering authentication credentials. Thus, the move to use of mobile devices to access systems provides an opportunity to study the effects of the user interface on authentication behaviors. We extend existing process models of secure behaviors to explain what influences their (dis)continuance. We conduct a longitudinal field experiment to test our predictions and find that the user interface does affect login success rates. In turn, poor performance (login failures) leads to discontinuance of a secure behavior and the adoption of less-secure behaviors. In summary, we find that a process model reveals important insights about how the IT artifact leads people to (dis)continue secure behaviors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0634","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['secure behavior', 'authentication', 'user interface']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of secure behavior and authentication in information systems, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We derive the conditions under which the client chooses not to monitor the vendor\u2019s effort and operates in a double moral hazard environment.

We use a unique data set of 1,267 advertiser keyword pairs with differing ad quality related to 360 keywords from a search engine to evaluate the click performance. We find that competing high-quality ads, appearing above the focal ad, have a lower negative effect on the click performance as compared to competing low-quality ads. We also find that this effect of competing ads varies with the ad position and the type of keyword. In general, the negative effect of competing high-quality ads decreases at low positions as compared to high positions. Furthermore, this decrease in the negative effect of competing high-quality ads is more substantial for specific keywords. Our results reveal consumer behavior in evaluating different quality ads in sponsored search. More specifically, our results suggest that consumers use the presence of high-quality competing ads as a signal of higher quality of the focal ad. Our findings can help advertisers better evaluate their relative performance for different positions for various types of keywords.

The successful implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in these countries is likely to hinge on a set of institutional factors that are shaped by the environmental tension between two competing forces, emergent catalysts, such as new economic policies and reform programs, and traditional challenges, such as infrastructure and traditional value systems. To unearth the temporal dynamics underlying the success and failure of ICT implementations in organizations in developing countries, we conducted a two-year multimethod study of an ICT implementation at a large bank in India. Based on data collected from over 1,000 employees and over 1,000 customers, we found, relative to preimplementation levels for up to two years postimplementation, that we characterized as the shakedown phase (1) operational efficiency did not improve, (2) job satisfaction declined, and (3) customer satisfaction declined. In-depth interviews of approximately 40 members of top management, 160 line employees, and 200 customers indicated that these outcomes could be attributed to the strong influence of a set of institutional factors, such as ICT-induced change, labor economics, Western isomorphism, parallel-manual system, and technology adaptation. The interplay between these institutional factors and the environmental tension posed a formidable challenge for the bank during our study that led to the poor and unintended outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0638","","ISR","Information Systems","4","['developing countries', 'institutional factors', 'job satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction']","The article discusses the impact of ICT implementation in a developing country, highlighting themes of institutional factors and their effects on job and customer satisfaction.

If the fit cost is low, the ISP will either allow both CPs to subsidize consumers\u2019 Internet access, or will allow only the more competitive CP to subsidize, depending on the per-consumer revenue generation rates of CPs. If the fit cost is high, it is in the ISPs interest not to allow any subsidization.

Prior literature has examined many devices to reduce such information asymmetry, e.g., vendor reputation, client-vendor prior relationship, vendors\u2019 Capability Maturity Model (CMM) rating, vendor location, and technological diversity of the vendor. We examine the impact of (to our knowledge) a hitherto unconsidered device, i.e., the use of an advisor. In the context of global sourcing, third-party advisors, with their accumulated knowledge of client requirements and the vendor landscape, can mitigate the information asymmetry between clients and vendors. However, in an extensive data set of IT outsourcing contracts going back two decades we found use of advisors to be rare (less than 5% of contracts go through an advisor). This motivates us to rigorously analyze their impact on clients and vendors as an open empirical question. Using a data set of 753 large IT outsourcing contracts, and through a series of econometric specifications and robustness tests, we establish that the presence of an advisor is associated with higher revenue for vendors and more positive contract outcomes. This analysis presents what is to our knowledge the first concrete evidence that third-party advisors can mitigate the information asymmetry in the IT outsourcing market and lead to better matching that benefits clients as well as vendors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0645","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['information asymmetry', 'vendors', 'clients']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of IT outsourcing and the role of advisors in mitigating information asymmetry, with no significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Our key result is that a job ladder motivating IT professionals with large, infrequent promotions will lead to higher turnover than a job ladder with smaller, more frequent promotions. We describe the conditions under which rearranging the job ladder creates economic value for the firm. We also offer an explanation for the observation that jobs characterized by boundary-spanning activities have higher turnover, and show that such jobs are more sensitive to the effect of likelihood of promotion on turnover. We test our hypotheses on a detailed data set covering 5,704 IT professionals over a five-year period. We confirm that likelihood of promotion has the predicted effects on turnover of IT professionals. A one standard deviation increase in likelihood of promotion decreases turnover by over 99%, consistent with our prediction.

How Messages That Interrupt Can Make Us Vulnerable","System-generated alerts are ubiquitous in personal computing and, with the proliferation of mobile devices, daily activity. While these interruptions provide timely information, research shows they come at a high cost in terms of increased stress and decreased productivity. This is due to dual-task interference (DTI), a cognitive limitation in which even simple tasks cannot be simultaneously performed without significant performance loss. Although previous research has examined how DTI impacts the performance of a primary task (the task that was interrupted), no research has examined the effect of DTI on the interrupting task. This is an important gap because in many contexts, failing to heed an alert\u2014the interruption itself\u2014can introduce critical vulnerabilities. Using security messages as our context, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how (1) DTI occurs in the brain in response to interruptive alerts, (2) DTI influences message security disregard, and (3) the effects of DTI can be mitigated by finessing the timing of the interruption. We show that neural activation is substantially reduced under a condition of high DTI, and the degree of reduction in turn significantly predicts security message disregard. Interestingly, we show that when a message immediately follows a primary task, neural activity in the medial temporal lobe is comparable to when attending to the message is the only task. Further, we apply these findings in an online behavioral experiment in the context of a web-browser warning. We demonstrate a practical way to mitigate the DTI effect by presenting the warning at low-DTI times, and show how mouse cursor tracking and psychometric measures can be used to validate low-DTI times in other contexts. Our findings suggest that although alerts are pervasive in personal computing, they should be bounded in their presentation. The timing of interruptions strongly influences the occurrence of DTI in the brain, which in turn substantially impacts alert disregard. This paper provides a theoretically grounded, cost-effective approach to reduce the effects of DTI for a wide variety of interruptive messages that are important but do not require immediate attention.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0644","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['vulnerable', 'interruptions', 'security']","The article discusses the vulnerabilities introduced by system-generated alerts, but it primarily focuses on cognitive limitations and productivity rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

Current theories struggle to explain how high-quality knowledge is developed in these settings and how participants self-organize in the absence of role definitions, traditional organizational controls, or formal coordination mechanisms. In this article, we engage the puzzle by investigating the temporal dynamics underlying emergent roles on individual and organizational levels. Comprised of a multilevel large-scale empirical study of Wikipedia stretching over a decade, our study investigates emergent roles in terms of prototypical activity patterns that organically emerge from individuals\u2019 knowledge production actions. Employing a stratified sample of 1,000 Wikipedia articles, we tracked 200,000 distinct participants and 700,000 coproduction activities, and recorded each activity\u2019s type. We found that participants\u2019 role-taking behavior is turbulent across roles, with substantial flow in and out of coproduction work. Our findings at the organizational level, however, show that work is organized around a highly stable set of emergent roles, despite the absence of traditional stabilizing mechanisms such as predefined work procedures or role expectations. This dualism in emergent work is conceptualized as \u201cturbulent stability.\u201d We attribute the stabilizing factor to the artifact-centric production process and present evidence to illustrate the mutual adjustment of role taking according to the artifact\u2019s needs and stage.

When there is rivalry and formal IP law is not effective, this could lead to underinvestment or withholding of IP, unless user-organized norms compensate for these shortcomings. This study is the first to explore the characteristics and functioning of such a norms-based IP system in the setting of anonymous, large-scale, and loose-knit online communities. To do so, we use data on the Threadless crowdsourcing community obtained through netnography, a survey, and a field experiment.

We analyze the system\u2019s characteristics and functioning, and we find that the \u201clegal certainty\u201d it provides is conducive to cooperation, cumulative effects, and innovation. We generalize our findings from the case by developing propositions aimed to spark further research.

In this way, we contribute to the literatures on norms-based IP systems and online communities and offer advice for the management of crowdsourcing communities.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0649","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['innovation', 'norms', 'regulation']","The article discusses user-organized norms and their role in regulating intellectual property, which touches on ethical considerations in innovation but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

This study investigates an open theoretical question: Why are particular innovations remixed by online innovation communities? Some innovations languish, while others are widely remixed. Community members (even those unknown to the innovation\u2019s creator) may remix, taking the source innovation in directions the original innovator may have never imagined. Within online innovation communities, remixing is not bound by some of the constraints to knowledge collaboration found in more traditional environments. To address our research question, we begin with variables constituent to innovation diffusion theory, essentially remixing this long-established theory to predict cumulative remixing in online innovation communities, using arguments grounded in the user innovation and learning literatures. We also consider two forms of communication that are relevant to knowledge sharing in online communities (online community interaction and front page presence). Regression analysis (using data pertaining to 498 3D printable innovations) shows that community interaction is highly influential in determining which innovations are remixed by the community. Conversely, the innovation having a presence on the community\u2019s front page does not have a significant effect on remixing. Observability has an inverse-U-shaped relationship with remixing; this suggests the value placed on experiential learning. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used as a supplementary analysis technique (with robustness testing), and the results are largely consistent with regression findings but offer interesting insight into innovation configurations that consistently result in remixing from the community. Within specific configurations, fsQCA results indicate a contingent effect of observability and complexity; that is, under certain conditions, complex innovations are more likely to be remixed by the community.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0650","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['innovation', 'knowledge collaboration', 'community interaction']","The article discusses knowledge collaboration within online communities, which hints at collective engagement but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Rational addicts anticipate the future consequences of their current behaviors and attempt to maximize utility from their intertemporal consumption choices. Conversely, myopic addicts tend toward immediate gratification and fail to fully recognize the future consequences of their current consumption. In lieu of conducting self-report surveys or aggregate-level demand estimation, this research examines addictive behaviors on the basis of consumption quantity at an individual level. To empirically validate rational addiction in the context of social app consumption, we collect and analyze 13-month, individual-level panel data on the weekly app usage of thousands of smartphone users. Results indicate that the average social app user conducts herself in a forward-looking manner and rationally adjusts consumption over time to derive optimal utility. The subgroup analysis, however, indicates that substantial variations in addictiveness and forward-looking propensities exist across demographically diverse groups. For example, addictive behaviors toward social network sites are more myopic in nature among older, less-educated, high-income groups. Additionally, the type of social app moderates the effects of demographic characteristics on the nature of addictive behaviors. We provide implications that policymakers can use to effectively manage mobile addiction problems, with the recommendations focusing on asymmetric social policies (e.g., information- and capacity-enhancing measures).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0658","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['demographically diverse', 'addictive behaviors', 'social policies']","The article discusses variations in addictive behaviors across 'demographically diverse groups' and suggests 'asymmetric social policies' to manage mobile addiction, indicating a moderate focus on social equity and ethical implications of technology use."],["2016","27","4","Ann Majchrzak\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Ann Majchrzakmajchrza@usc.eduMarshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089; and ESADE Business School, 08034 Barcelona, SpainSearch for more papers by this author, Arvind MalhotraArvind Malhotramalhotra@unc.eduKenan\u2013Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599Search for more papers by this author","Effect of Knowledge-Sharing Trajectories on Innovative Outcomes in Temporary Online Crowds","There is substantial research on the effects of formal control structures (i.e., incentives, identities, organization, norms) on knowledge sharing leading to innovative outcomes in online communities.

A paradox-framed trajectory is one in which a novel solution emerges when different participants post in the following sequence: (1) contributing a paradox associated with the problem objective, (2) sharing assumptions to validate the paradox, and (3) sharing initial ideas for resolving the paradox in a manner that meets the problem statement.

An Integration of Online Disinhibition and Deindividuation Effects with the Social Structure and Social Learning Model","The dramatic increase in social media use has challenged traditional social structures and shifted a great deal of interpersonal communication from the physical world to cyberspace. Much of this social media communication has been positive: Anyone around the world who has access to the Internet has the potential to communicate with and attract a massive global audience. Unfortunately, such ubiquitous communication can be also used for negative purposes such as cyberbullying, which is the focus of this paper. Previous research on cyberbullying, consisting of 135 articles, has improved the understanding of why individuals\u2014mostly adolescents\u2014engage in cyberbullying. However, our study addresses two key gaps in this literature: (1) how the information technology (IT) artifact fosters/inhibits cyberbullying and (2) why people are socialized to engage in cyberbullying. To address these gaps, we propose the social media cyberbullying model (SMCBM), which modifies Akers\u2019 [Akers RL (2011) Social Learning and Social Structure: A General Theory of Crime and Deviance, 2nd ed. (Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ)] social structure and social learning model. Because Akers developed his model for crimes in the physical world, we add a rich conceptualization of anonymity composed of five subconstructs as a key social media structural variable in the SMCBM to account for the IT artifact. We tested the SMCBM with 1,003 adults who have engaged in cyberbullying. The empirical findings support the SMCBM. Heavy social media use combined with anonymity facilitates the social learning process of cyberbullying in social media in a way that fosters cyberbullying. Our results indicate new directions for cyberbullying research and implications for anticyberbullying practices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0671","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['cyberbullying', 'social learning', 'anonymity', 'social structure', 'communication']","The article addresses the negative social implications of cyberbullying, highlighting the role of social structures and communication in fostering harmful behaviors.

Using a unique panel data set, we first conduct regression discontinuity analyses to verify a discontinuous jump in context generation activities and disclosure patterns around the time of the policy change. We next estimate unobserved effects models to assess the short-run and long-run effects of the change. Results show that Facebook users, on average, increase use of wall posts and decrease use of private messages after the introduction of granular privacy controls. Also, users\u2019 disclosure patterns change to reflect the increased openness in content sharing. These effects are realized immediately and over time. More importantly, we show that user-specific factors play crucial roles in shaping users\u2019 varying reactions to the policy change. While more privacy sensitive users (those who do not reveal their gender and/or those who have exclusive disclosure patterns ex ante) share more content openly and less content secretly than before, less privacy sensitive users (those who reveal their gender and/or those who have inclusive disclosure patterns ex ante) share less content openly and more content secretly after the change. Hence, the policy change effectively diminishes variation among Facebook users in terms of content-generation activities and disclosure patterns. Therefore, characterizing the privacy change as a way to foster openness across all user categories does not reveal the change\u2019s true influence. Although an average Facebook user seems to favor increased openness, the policy change has different impacts on various groups of users based on their sensitivity to privacy, and this impact is not necessarily toward increased openness. To our knowledge, this is the first study that relies on observational data to assess the impact of a major privacy change on dynamic content-sharing activities and the resulting disclosure patterns of Facebook users.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0672","","ISR","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'disclosure', 'openness', 'user-specific factors']","The article discusses privacy controls and their impact on user behavior, which touches on ethical considerations regarding user privacy and data sharing.

These interdependencies reflect, for example, unidentified or emerging knowledge-based dependencies between the community members or unaccounted relationships between ongoing community tasks. At the same time, online communities cannot resort to hierarchical coordination mechanisms such as incentives or command structures to address such interdependencies. So, how do they manage such interdependencies? To address this question, we conduct an exploratory, theory-generating case study involving qualitative and computational analyses of development activities within an open source software community: Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of interdependencies within the community and find that unresolved interdependencies are associated with alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we define as routines. In particular, we observe that two distinct classes of interdependencies\u2014development and developer interdependencies\u2014are associated with alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two generalized routine components\u2014direct implementation and knowledge integration, which address these two distinct classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular, direct implementation deals with development interdependencies within the code that are not already coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge integration resolves unaccounted interdependencies between developers.

The problem is typically approached from the perspective of protecting the credibility of review platforms, as well as the reputation and revenue of the reviewed firms. However, there is little examination of the vulnerability of individual businesses to fake review attacks. This study focuses on formalizing the visibility of a business to the customer base and on evaluating its vulnerability to fake review attacks. We operationalize visibility as a function of the features that a business can cover and its position in the platform\u2019s review-based ranking. Using data from over 2.3 million reviews of 4,709 hotels from 17 cities, we study how visibility can be impacted by different attack strategies. We find that even limited injections of fake reviews can have a significant effect and explore the factors that contribute to this vulnerable state. Specifically, we find that, in certain markets, 50 fake reviews are sufficient for an attacker to surpass any of its competitors in terms of visibility. We also compare the strategy of self-injecting positive reviews with that of injecting competitors with negative reviews and find that each approach can be as much as 40% more effective than the other across different settings. We empirically explore response strategies for an attacked hotel, ranging from the enhancement of its own features to detecting and disputing fake reviews. In general, our measure of visibility and our modeling approach regarding attack and response strategies shed light on how businesses that are targeted by fake reviews can detect and tackle such attacks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0674","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['fake reviews', 'vulnerability', 'visibility']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of fake reviews and their impact on business visibility and reputation, with no significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

The objective of the monitoring problem is to maximize the benefit of monitoring minus the monitoring cost. The key trade-off in our model is that as more sessions are monitored, the attack costs should decrease. However, the monitoring cost would likely increase with the number of sessions being monitored. A key step in solving the problem is to derive the probability density of a system with n sessions being monitored with a session\u2019s age measured as the time elapsed since it last generated a suspicious event. We next optimize the number of sessions monitored by trading off the attack cost saved with the cost of monitoring. A profiling step is added prior to monitoring and a resulting two-dimensional optimization problem is studied. Through numerical simulation, we find that a simple size-based policy is quite robust for a very reasonable range of values and, under typical situations, performs almost as well as the two more sophisticated policies do. Also, we find that adopting a simplified policy without using the option of managing sessions using age threshold can greatly increase the ease of finding an optimal solution, and reduce operational overhead with little performance loss compared with a policy using such an option. The insights gained from the mechanics of profiling and monitoring are leveraged to suggest a socially optimal contract for outsourcing these activities in a reward-based contract. We also study penalty-based contracts. Such contracts (specifically, when the penalty is levied as a percentage of the monthly service fee) do not achieve the social optimum. We show how an appropriate penalty coefficient can be chosen to implement a socially optimal penalty-based contract. In addition, we provide a high-level comparison between reward- and penalty-based contracts. In a penalty-based contract, the setting of the fixed payment can be challenging because it requires additional knowledge of the total expected malicious event rate, which needs to be observed through a period of no monitoring.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2016.0677","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['socially optimal', 'penalty-based contracts', 'monitoring']","The article discusses the concept of socially optimal contracts, which hints at ethical considerations in operational practices.

Further, we find that the common-auditor effect is more pronounced for deals with greater pre-acquisition uncertainty and deals involving acquirers and targets that are audited by the same local office of the common auditor.

We refer to this phenomenon as beliefs-driven price association (BPA). By explicitly considering the phenomenon of BPA, we show that the price response to information releases can vary over time even if the risk-free interest rate and investor preferences are static and the earnings/cash flow generating process is stable. This observation suggests, for example, that price-to-earnings associations and price volatility can vary over time even if a stable pattern of economic fundamentals suggests otherwise. The possibility of BPA suggests that measures of the cost of capital, information content, and growth prospects inferred from observed market prices will be confounded. While we do not predict when periods of BPA will arise, we provide empirically testable predictions about how prices should behave during periods of BPA. In particular, we predict that, during sufficiently long periods of high (positive or negative) BPA, price volatility, price levels, and expected returns will be higher than would be implied by a fundamental valuation framework. Finally, while BPA in the pricing of one security does not cause BPA in the pricing of other securities, the price levels of those other securities will be affected if the securities with BPA are sufficiently large relative to the market as a whole.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410115000531","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial concepts such as price association and market behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Despite this, accounting research has provided little understanding of how economic forces affect a firm\u05f3s level of accruals and limited guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante firm characteristics. We consider accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework provide insight into the relation between accruals and the ex ante expected volatility faced by the firm. Specifically, the theory predicts that higher volatility dampens investment because firms prefer to \u2018wait and see\u2019 instead of investing immediately. Consistent with this theory, we document a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility. We also predict and find that the negative association between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility is less pronounced for distressed firms and more pronounced for firms with a longer operating cycle, and that current asset accruals are more sensitive to volatility than current liability accruals. Finally, we find that the residuals from an investment-based expected accrual model outperform those from the widely-used performance-adjusted modified Jones model in identifying companies that just meet or beat analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts. Collectively, our findings suggest that the investment perspective of accruals, and in particular the real options-based investment framework, provide useful insights for forming expectations of accruals.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410116300337","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting and investment strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that the overall correlation between accruals and cash flows has dramatically declined in magnitude over the past half century and has largely disappeared in more recent years. The adjusted R\u20092 from regressing (changes in) accruals on (changes in) cash flows drops from about 70% (90%) in the 1960s to near zero (under 20%) in more recent years. In exploring potential reasons for the observed attenuation, we find that increases in non-timing-related accrual recognition, as proxied by one-time and nonoperating items and the frequency of loss firm-years, explain the majority of the overall decline. On the other hand, temporal changes in the matching between revenues and expenses, and the growth of intangible-intensive industries play only a limited role in explaining the observed attenuation. Finally, the relative decline of the timing role of accruals does not appear to be associated with an increase in the asymmetrically timely loss recognition role.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accrual accounting and its correlation with cash flows, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We use this setting to examine whether the public pressure led scrutinized firms to increase their subsidiary disclosure, decrease tax avoidance, and reduce the use of subsidiaries in tax haven countries compared to other firms in the FTSE 100 not affected by the public pressure. The evidence suggests that the public scrutiny sufficiently changed the costs and benefits of tax avoidance such that tax expense increased for scrutinized firms.

Next, we discuss empirical studies that link disclosure and reporting activities to firm-specific and market-wide economic outcomes. Understanding these links is important when evaluating regulation. We then synthesize the empirical evidence on the economic effects of disclosure regulation and reporting standards, including the evidence on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption. Several important conclusions emerge. We generally lack evidence on market-wide effects and externalities from regulation, yet such evidence is central to the economic justification of regulation. Moreover, evidence on causal effects of disclosure and reporting regulation is still relatively rare. We also lack evidence on the real effects of such regulation.

This study examines the effect of these information risks on the structure of optimal debt contracts in international (cross-border) versus domestic private debt markets. Using mandatory IFRS adoption as an indicator for institutional changes that reduced differences between countries, I compare attributes of international versus domestic loans before and after IFRS adoption. I find that, in the pre-IFRS period, international loans are associated with a higher credit spread, a weaker relationship between the bank and the borrower, a more diffuse loan syndicate, and less reliance on accounting-based covenants than domestic loans. These results are consistent with incremental information risks in international debt markets that make it more costly for lenders to screen and monitor borrower credit quality, resulting in a more arm's-length relationship between borrowers and lenders. Many of these associations attenuate after IFRS adoption, suggesting that the pre-IFRS differences in contract terms are driven by incremental information risks related to institutional differences between countries. My findings imply that incremental information risks result in a different optimal contract in international debt contracts compared to domestic debt contracts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12111","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of international debt markets and the impact of IFRS adoption on contract terms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We identify and test five theories from prior research (litigation risk, constraining opportunism, complexity, transaction frequency, and age) that could explain why some U.S. accounting standards contain rules-based characteristics. Litigation risk and complexity are most consistently related to cross-sectional and time-series variation in rules-based characteristics. We find more limited evidence that frequent transactions, age, and desires by regulators to constrain opportunistic reporting are related to rules-based standards. We note, however, that our findings are necessarily descriptive because standards arise endogenously from market and political forces, limiting causal interpretation. Further, it is difficult to perfectly separate rules-based characteristics of the standard from both the complexity of the standard and the characteristics of the underlying transaction, including the complexity of the transaction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12112","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a new text-based measure of competition, and an instrumental variables analysis that exploits exogenous variation in bank deregulation, we provide robust evidence that greater competition increases both individual bank risk and a bank's contribution to system-wide risk. Specifically, we find that higher competition is associated with lower underwriting standards, less timely loan loss recognition, and a shift toward noninterest revenue. Further, we find that higher competition is associated with higher stand-alone risk of individual banks, greater sensitivity of a bank's downside equity risk to system-wide distress, and a greater contribution by individual banks to downside risk of the banking sector.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12117","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bank competition and risk without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A commitment to uniform regulation reduces economic distortions caused by lobbying by creating a free-rider problem between lobbying firms at the cost of forcing the same treatment on heterogeneous firms. Resolving this tradeoff, an institutional commitment to uniformity is socially desirable when firms are sufficiently homogeneous or the costs of lobbying to society are large. We show that the regulatory intensity for a given firm can be increasing or decreasing in the degree of uniformity, even though uniformity always reduces lobbying.

We find that Estimize forecasts are incrementally useful in forecasting earnings and measuring the market's expectations of earnings. Our results are stronger when the number of Estimize contributors is larger, consistent with the benefits of crowdsourcing increasing with the size of the crowd.

Overall, the observed likelihood of coordination failure is higher and coordination efficiency is lower than predicted by theory.

I find an earnings-based covenant is typically based on a performance measure close to earnings before interest, tax, amortization, and depreciation expenses (EBITDA). However, my empirical analyses show that EBITDA is less useful in explaining credit risk than earnings before interest and tax expenses (EBIT) and even the bottom-line net income. Thus, measuring credit risk cannot fully explain the choice of accounting performance measures in earnings-based covenants. I conjecture that contracting parties choose an EBITDA-related measure, instead of a measure calculated after depreciation and amortization expenses (e.g., EBIT), to make the performance measure less sensitive to investment activities, which can be controlled through other contractual terms, such as a restriction on capital expenditure, and provide empirical evidence consistent with this conjecture.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12125","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial covenants and performance measures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Using SFAS 159 adoption as our setting, we find that a small but significant proportion of loans (14.5%) modify covenant definitions to exclude the effects of SFAS 159 fair values. Only a limited number of these modifications exclude assets elected at fair value (less than 7%), while all exclude liabilities elected at fair value. Notably, we document that covenant definition modification is unassociated with ex ante fair value elections. We find that covenant definition modification positively varies with common incentive problems attributed to fair value accounting and negatively varies with benefits attributed to fair value accounting. Our results suggest that fair value accounting is not uniformly detrimental for debt contracting and fair value adjustments are included when they are most likely to improve performance measurement.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12126","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and debt contracting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Psychology theory argues that both of these attributes can improve estimates. We examine whether these attributes depend on consultants' status motives, that is, the desire to gain respect from or power over others. We find that active status motives lead consultants with higher specialized knowledge to provide recommendations that are less contrary, but more precise. However, consultants increase precision by tightening range bounds in a manner that is not counter to management's preference and thus unlikely to prompt the audit team to challenge the estimate. We also find that higher consultant decision authority constrains precision. Our findings suggest limits to consultation's potential effectiveness in improving estimates. For instance, our findings suggest that firms and standard setters direct consultants to focus scrutiny on the range bound that is most likely to constrain management opportunism.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12150","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['consultation', 'estimates', 'status motives']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of audit consultations and decision-making processes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Based on a Fiskenian relational configuration analysis, the study shows how indigenes in a rural European town interpret certain immigrant consumption practices as manifestations of a gradual sell-out of the indigenous community, a crumbling of their authority, a violation of equality rules, and of indigenes being torn between contradictory micro- and macro-social morals.

We detail a set of practices within four themes\u2014location, construction, customization, and inhabitation\u2014that enables the conversion of private space to public place and the creation of community from a confederacy of consumption encampments. These dynamics are presented as a Mobius strip to emphasize not only the simultaneity of stages, but also the constant sharing of energy. By examining how midwestern American tailgaters in a collegiate setting personalize public place and publicize personal place, we demonstrate how individuals negotiate two of the fundamental consumption ideologies of public space.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/130/1806691","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['social engagement', 'community', 'public space', 'ritual']","The article discusses the concept of 'vestaval' as a means of fostering social and civic engagement through consumption, which aligns with moderate woke themes of community building and public space utilization.

Using ethnographic and netnographic data from the collaborative network of geocaching, this study explains the emergence of hybrid economies. Performativity theory is mobilized to demonstrate that the hybrid status of these economies is constantly under threat of destabilization by the struggle between competing performativities of market and nonmarket modes of exchange. Despite latent tension between competing performativities, the hybrid economy is sustained through consumer\u2013producer engagements in collaborative consumption and production, the creation of zones of indeterminacy, and the enactment of tournaments of value that dissipate controversies around hybrid transactions. Implications are drawn for consumer research on the interplay between market and nonmarket economies.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/152/1810295","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['collaborative consumption', 'hybrid economies', 'nonmarket modes', 'consumer\u2013producer engagements']","The article discusses themes of collaborative consumption and the interplay between market and nonmarket economies, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics and ethical considerations in economic exchanges.

They do so to be helpful to review readers, who find explained actions more helpful for utilitarian products and explained reactions more helpful for hedonic products. Explained actions and reactions are differentially helpful across product type because they increase readers\u2019 ability to predict their attitude toward the reviewed product: explained actions increase attitude predictability for utilitarian products, whereas explained reactions increase attitude predictability for hedonic products. These increases in attitude predictability and review helpfulness ultimately increase readers\u2019 choice of the product in question.

The results of six experiments show that consumers\u2019 evaluations vary as a function of concept combination interpretation strategy (property mapping or relational linking) and whether cobranded partners have complementary or similar attributes. Specifically, when consumers use property mapping, they evaluate cobranded partnerships with complementary (vs. similar) attribute levels more favorably. In contrast, when using relational linking, they evaluate cobranded partnerships with complementary (vs. similar) attribute levels less favorably. The results also reveal that the breadth of the host brand (broad vs. narrow) and the type of advertising influence the extent to which consumers are likely to use property mapping or relational linking in evaluating cobranded partnerships.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/45/1811450","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cobranding and consumer evaluations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the current research, we suggest that feelings of financial constraint increase consumers\u2019 concern about the lasting utility of their purchases, which in turn increases their preference for material goods over experiences. The results of seven studies confirm that the consideration of financial constraints shifts consumers\u2019 preferences toward material goods (rather than experiences), and that this systematic shift is due to an increased concern about the longevity of the purchase. This preference shift persists even when the material goods are more frivolous than the experiences, indicating that the effect is not driven by an increased desire for sensible and justifiable purchases. However, the shift toward material purchases disappears when the material good is unusually short lived, further implicating concern about longevity as the key driver of the effect. Finally, the consideration of financial constraints increases preference for material purchases even when the potential memories that experiences can provide are made explicitly salient. Together, these results indicate that financially constrained consumers spend their discretionary money on material purchases as a means of securing long-term consumption utility.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/59/1811505","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['financial constraints', 'material goods', 'experiences']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior related to financial constraints without addressing broader social issues or ethical considerations.

Drawing from research on values (Schwartz 1994), the symbolic power of brands (Holt 2004, 2006; McCracken 1986), and system justification theory (Jost and Banaji 1994), the current research explores (1) what values define America\u2019s dominant ideology, (2) which consumers subscribe to these values, and (3) implications for brands that reflect versus do not reflect the dominant ideology. It is proposed that consumers vary in their satisfaction with American society and their endorsement of America\u2019s defining values, and thus differ in the values they endorse versus reject in brands. Five experiments manipulate whether or not the values signaled by a brand are in alignment with the dominant ideology. Consumers more versus less satisfied with American society respond differently to the values a brand signals, affecting brand attitudes, perceptions of a brand\u2019s status as a cultural icon, and purchase intentions. In a sixth experiment, those more versus less satisfied with American society respond differently to consumer-related policy (i.e., a ban on trans fat), depending on the values that the policy is framed as reflecting. Implications for branding and policy are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/76/1811239","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['values', 'dominant ideology', 'cultural icon', 'consumer-related policy', 'satisfaction']","The article explores how brands reflect societal values and the implications for consumers' preferences based on their alignment with dominant ideologies, indicating a moderate focus on social justice themes.

The results of five experiments and one field study involving different operationalizations of self-construal and goal pursuit activities suggest that attainment (maintenance) goals can be more motivating for participants with a more independent (interdependent) self-construal and that differences in salient knowledge about pursuing the goals are one potential mechanism underlying this effect. This interaction effect was found within a single culture, between cultures, when self-construal was experimentally manipulated or measured, and when potential confounding factors like regulatory focus were controlled for. The effect was also found to impact consumer behavior in real life\u2014self-construal, as reflected by the number of social ties consumers had, impacted the likelihood that they opted to reduce versus maintain their bodyweight. Further, after setting their goal, consumers who were more independent exhibited more (less) motivation, as measured by the amount of money they put at stake, when their goal was weight reduction (maintenance). These findings shed light on the relationship between self-construal and goal type, and offer insights, to both consumers and managers, on how to increase motivation for goal pursuit.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/1/93/1811658","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-construal', 'consumer behavior', 'motivation']","The article examines consumer motivation through the lens of self-construal, which touches on individual differences but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

There is a zone of indifference for small time gains (losses), increasing marginal utility (disutility) for moderate time gains (losses), and diminishing marginal utility (disutility) for large time gains (losses). Moderate amounts of time exhibit increasing marginal utility (disutility) because larger blocks of time provide a more diverse set of usage opportunities. It is only when it is difficult to imagine how more (less) time would be beneficial (detrimental) that there is diminishing marginal utility (disutility) for time. Thus time valuation shows increasing marginal utility when there is a time deficit, but diminishing marginal utility when there is a time surplus.

Eight studies confirm that this is indeed the case, with the result holding even for stick figures, thus controlling for typical visual indicators of social class such as clothing or jewelry. Furthermore, these social class inferences mediate a relationship between social density and product valuation, with individuals assessing both higher prices and a greater willingness to pay for products presented in less crowded contexts. This effect of inferred class on product valuation is explained by status-motivated individuals\u2019 desire to associate with higher-status people.

Rather than treating the roller derby field as an autonomous enclave of gender resistance, this study focuses on the interrelationships between derby grrrls\u2019 resignifying performances of femininity and the gender constraints that have been naturalized in their everyday lives. The market-mediated nature of derby grrrls\u2019 ideological edgework enables them to challenge orthodox gender boundaries, without losing sociocultural legitimacy. This analysis casts new theoretical light on the gendered habitus and reveals key differences to the outcomes that would follow from Bourdieusian assumptions about the deployment of cultural capital in zero-sum status competitions. The concept of ideological edgework also presents a theoretical alternative to critical arguments, such as the commodity feminism thesis, that assume an inherently paradoxical and, ultimately co-opting, relationship exists between practices of countercultural resistance and marketplace performances. We further argue that ideological edgework redresses some of the conceptual ambiguities that can lead gender researchers to conflate gender performativity with social performances.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/2/235/1816331","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['gender performativity', 'gender resistance', 'ideological edgework', 'femininity', 'cultural capital']","The article strongly emphasizes themes of gender performativity and resistance, analyzing how women in roller derby navigate and challenge gender norms within a marketplace context.

Four studies evince that differences in hierarchical structure inherent in brands working with (i.e., partner brands) versus working for (i.e., servant brands) consumers engender materialism to play a systematic role in determining consumer responses to being an equal partner versus dominating master in consumer-brand relationships. In particular, materialists respond more favorably to a servant brand than to a partner brand when the brand is anthropomorphized (vs. objectified), and they respond more favorably to an anthropomorphized servant brand than do nonmaterialists. This effect is actualized through traits of materialists, moderated by brand status and mediated by an activated desire to dominate the servant brand.

Specifically, local optimism increases sequential choice consistency, whereas local pessimism increases sequential variety seeking. We test this foresight effect in two experimental paradigms, using both real and hypothetical consumer choices, across six studies. We first establish the basic effect of situational future outlook on sequential choice consistency (studies 1 and 2). Then we provide evidence that differences in the preference for self-continuity underlie the effect (studies 3, 4, and 5). Last, we extend this effect to choices between broadly defined usual and novel consumer products (study 6). Across the studies, we rule out differences in mood, causal attribution, and perceived control as alternative explanations.

Yet, paradoxically, as intragroup diversity increases, dominant rituals deployed for this relational work, can run counter to the ideologically rooted identities of some members. Using a sociological lens, this article focuses on the complexities of not celebrating a dominant collective consumption ritual by focusing on people who do not celebrate Christmas in America. The qualitative data analysis finds that non-celebrants use a set of ritual strategies that are grounded in their conflicting goals of protecting their ideologically rooted identities but also doing relational work with celebrators. It shows how non-celebrants deploy consumptive elements of the dominant ritual as symbolic resources to enact each strategy, foregrounding or backgrounding the symbolic boundary between themselves and celebrators.

Examining consumer responses to real products, this research shows that such effects arise because guilt\u2014by its focus on previous wrongdoings\u2014activates a general desire to improve the self. This increase in desire for self-improvement products is only observed for choices involving the self (not others), is not observed in response to other negative emotions (e.g., shame, embarrassment, sadness, or envy), and is mitigated when people hold the belief that the self is nonmalleable. Building on past work that focuses on how guilt often leads to the motivation to alleviate feelings of guilt either directly or indirectly, the current research demonstrates an additional, novel downstream consequence of guilt, showing that only guilt has the unique motivational consequence of activating a general desire to improve the self, which subsequently spills into other domains and spurs self-improving product choices. These findings are discussed in light of their implications for research on the distinct motivational consequences of specific emotions and on consumer well-being.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/3/401/1819530","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-improvement', 'guilt', 'consumer well-being']","The article discusses consumer behavior related to self-improvement, which touches on personal development but lacks a strong focus on social justice or broader ethical implications.

The current research finds that if a stimulus is perceived as a reaction to an action, it can reinforce the action even if the stimulus is a priori nonpositive and noninformative. Mere reactions are reinforcing. Specifically, eight experiments, including a field experiment, demonstrate that individuals are more likely to repeat an action (e.g., inserting money in a donation box or typing a message in a textbox) if the action is followed by a stimulus (e.g., the emission of a sound or the flash of an image) than if it is not, even if the stimulus is a priori negative (e.g., an annoying sound or an aversive image) and carries no useful information. Moreover, the effect just described will occur only if the stimulus is contingent on (immediately follows) the action and perceived as a reaction to the action. Finally, by serving as a reaction, an a priori nonpositive stimulus can become positive. The present work yields theoretical implications for stimulus\u2013response relationships and practical implications for designs of consumer products and loyalty programs.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/3/420/1818708","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and stimulus-response relationships without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This research draws on theory in evolutionary biology suggesting that investment in female versus male offspring depends on resource availability. Applying this to consumers, a series of experiments show that poor economic conditions favor resource allocations to daughters over sons. For example, poor conditions led people to bequeath more assets to girls in their will, and to choose girls to receive a US Treasury bond and a beneficial extracurricular activity. It is proposed that this happens because spending on children represents a reproductive investment, and that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 relative reproductive value varies with economic conditions. Supporting this account, perceptions of which child will have more children statistically mediates the effect of economic conditions on preferences for girls. Consequently, the effect is strengthened as a child approaches reproductive age, and it is moderated by individual differences (risk aversion and monogamy) directly related to our theoretical model. This research contributes to the consumer behavior literature by revealing how, why, and when environmental factors influence spending on girls versus boys.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/3/435/1819102","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['gender', 'investment', 'economic conditions', 'bias', 'consumer behavior']","The article explores gender bias in parental investment during economic recessions, indicating a moderate engagement with social themes related to gender equity.

One explanation is that similar others are perceived to have preferences that are correlated with one\u2019s own, and this makes their advice more diagnostic. The other is that similar others are liked more so people follow their advice to maintain connectedness with them. We propose a more general explanation that incorporates the advice taker\u2019s processing goals. To process any advice, advice takers activate a mentalizing goal, which is to understand the adviser\u2019s mental states. Similarity creates a perception of such an understanding and induces a feeling of certainty (i.e., a feeling of knowing) that validates the advice as a decision input and increases persuasion. A mentalizing explanation accounts for the effect even when similarity cannot lead to perceptions of correlated preferences or to interpersonal liking. Four studies show that the effect attenuates if advice takers are less likely to mentalize, are already primed to feel certain, or misattribute their feeling of certainty to a source other than the advice. Furthermore, the feeling of certainty emanating from similarity even influences decisions unrelated to the advice.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/3/458/1819938","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['persuasion', 'similarity', 'mentalizing']","The article primarily focuses on the psychological mechanisms of persuasion related to similarity, without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study examines such changes in symbolic power through an ethnographic study of a village in North India. Marketization and accompanying privatization do not create an independent sphere where only money matters, but due to a mix of new socioeconomic motives, they produce new social obligations, contests, and solidarities. These findings call into question the emphasis in consumer research on top-down class emulation as an essential characteristic of status hierarchies. This study offers insights into sharing as a means of enacting and reshaping symbolic power within a status hierarchy. A new order based on markets and consumption is disrupting the old order based on caste. As the old moral order dissolves, so do the old status hierarchies, obligations, dispositions, and norms of sharing that held the village together for centuries. In the microcosm of these gains and losses, we may see something of the broader social and economic changes taking place throughout India and other industrializing countries.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/3/472/1820435","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['caste', 'marketization', 'social obligations', 'solidarities', 'status hierarchies']","The article explores the intersection of caste and market dynamics, emphasizing social obligations and the disruption of traditional hierarchies, which aligns with themes of social justice and equity.

The current research shows that this seemingly contradictory influence can be accounted for by considering the information about the event that generated the pride (i.e., appraisal information) and whether or not a self-regulatory goal is active. In the absence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning the locus of control (e.g., \u201cI contributed to this achievement; it was not luck\u201d) can be used to make positive inferences about one\u2019s self-concept that reinforce further self-regulation. In the presence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning personal agency (e.g., \u201cThis was my achievement, not someone else\u2019s achievement\u201d) can be used to make positive inferences about one\u2019s progress toward self-regulation that, in turn, licenses indulgence. Thus appraisal information and the presence of self-regulatory goals is critical to how a self-conscious emotion like pride influences subsequent behavior.

In many situations, the symptoms of such decisional conflict are conspicuous. This article explores an important and unexamined question: How does observing someone else experiencing decisional conflict impact our own preferences? The authors show that observing others\u2019 emotional conflict and agony over an impending decision makes the observer\u2019s preferences converge to those of the conflicted actor (i.e., choose similarly). Thus this article contributes to the social influence literature by demonstrating that observers\u2019 preferences are not only influenced by an actor\u2019s ultimate choice, but also by the process leading to this choice. For example, in one experiment, participants\u2019 real monetary donations to one of two charities converged to those of a paid confederate who agonized over the decision. Six studies demonstrate this effect and show that it is triggered by empathy and a greater sense of shared identity with the conflicted actor. Accordingly, the studies show the effect is more pronounced for individuals with a greater tendency to empathize with others, and that convergence occurs only if participants deem the actor\u2019s conflict warranted given the decision at hand. The authors also demonstrate important implications of this effect in contexts of group decision making.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/4/515/2572165","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['empathy', 'shared identity', 'conflict', 'preferences', 'social influence']","The article discusses the impact of observing emotional conflict on decision-making, emphasizing themes of empathy and shared identity, which align with moderate woke themes related to social influence and group dynamics.

In this article, we compare speaking to manual preference expression modalities (button-pressing, writing, and taking) and study their effect on self-control dilemmas. Based on studies of the Stroop task and on neuroscientific evidence, we predict that speaking is less likely than motor movement to evoke self-control. Our prediction relies on the observation that different expression modalities activate different regions of the anterior cingulate cortex and hence may influence the extent to which emotions rather than cognitions determine an individual\u2019s decision. In six studies conducted both in the lab and the field, we show that speaking prompts more indulgent choice than manual modalities (studies 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4) but not when individuals speak in a foreign language (study 5).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/4/535/2572189","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and self-control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We demonstrate that, in the domain of charitable giving, money is construed relatively more concretely, whereas time is construed relatively more abstractly. This difference in the construal of these two resources has implications for how appeals for charitable contributions or money versus time should be framed. When the construal level at which the consumer considers the cause is aligned (misaligned) with the construal level of the resource being requested, contribution intentions and behaviors increase (decrease). In addition, the moderating role of resource abundance is examined. In particular, when money is considered abundant (vs. nonabundant), consumers no longer exhibit more concrete thoughts in response to money compared to time. Finally, when the donation request makes consumers think of money in a more abundant manner, monetary donations can be successfully motivated with a more abstract call for charitable support. The theoretical and practical implications for marketers and charitable organizations are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/4/551/2572176","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['charitable giving', 'consumer', 'appeals', 'donation', 'support']","The article discusses the implications of consumer behavior on charitable giving, which reflects a moderate focus on social responsibility and ethical considerations in marketing.

Because satiation is a natural human response when consuming a product repeatedly, all consumers are likely to feel the pull downward on their product enjoyment over time. This drop in enjoyment produces dissonance in consumers with an activated identity because reduced enjoyment with identity-consistent products conflicts with their identity. Resisting this drop results in lowered levels of satiation, and these satiation differences are even reflected in subsequent consumption behavior. These results have theoretical implications both for the nascent research area of satiation in consumer behavior and for developing a fuller sense of the relationship between consumer identity and consumption.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/4/564/2572163","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['identity', 'consumption', 'satiation']","The article discusses consumer identity and its relationship with product consumption, which touches on themes of identity but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

However, this may not always be true. A pilot study and five field and laboratory experiments show that when a self-presentation concern is made salient, consumers react less positively to highly attractive providers than to less attractive ones. This concern can be influenced by chronic social anxiety or can be aroused by unrelated experiences that consumers have before being exposed to the service interactions. In addition, it can be activated by the type of product being sold, that is, a product that is likely to cause embarrassment. Thus the attractiveness of a service provider can have either positive or negative effects on consumers\u2019 reactions to a consumption experience and their consequent purchase intentions, depending on the type of product under consideration. These effects occur when the service provider is both of the opposite sex and the same sex. However, self-presentation concerns when an opposite-sex provider is attractive are driven by sexual motives, whereas these self-presentation concerns when a same-sex target is attractive are stimulated by social comparison processes.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/4/578/2572203","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-presentation', 'social anxiety', 'attractiveness']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and the effects of attractiveness on purchase intentions, with limited reference to social issues.

They are abstract concepts, often difficult to define and grasp. Thus throughout the history of Western society, the head and the heart, concrete and identifiable elements, have been used as symbols of rationality and emotion. Drawing on the conceptual metaphor framework, we propose that people understand the abstract concepts of rationality and emotion using knowledge of a more concrete concept\u2014the vertical difference between the head and heart. In six studies, we show a deep-seated conceptual metaphorical relationship linking rationality with \u201cup\u201d or \u201chigher\u201d and emotion with \u201cdown\u201d or \u201clower.\u201d We show that the association between verticality and rationality/emotion affects how consumers perceive information and thereby has downstream consequences on attitudes and preferences. We find the association to be most influential when consumers are unaware of it and when it applies to an unfamiliar stimulus. Because all visual formats\u2014from the printed page to screens on a television, computer, or smartphone\u2014entail a vertical placement, this association has important managerial implications.

This preference arises from the perception that items with earlier serial numbers are temporally closer to the origin (e.g., the designer or artist who produced it). In turn, beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special essence from their past) lead consumers to view these items as possessing more of a valued essence. Using an archival data set and five lab experiments, the authors find the preference for items with earlier serial numbers holds across multiple consumer domains including recorded music, art, and apparel. Further, this preference appears to be independent from inferences about the quality of the item, salience of the number, or beliefs about market value. Finally, when serial numbers no longer reflect beliefs about proximity to the origin, the preference for items with earlier serial numbers is attenuated.

Specifically, individuals who pay with more painful forms of payment increase their emotional attachment to a product, decrease their commitment to nonchosen alternatives, are more likely to publicly signal their commitment to an organization, and are more likely to make a repeat transaction. Moreover, the form of payment influences post-transaction connection even when the objective monetary cost remains constant and when the psychological cost is indirect (i.e., donating someone else\u2019s money).

It is theorized and shown that circular- versus angular-logo shapes activate softness and hardness associations, respectively, and these concepts subsequently influence product/company attribute judgments through a resource-demanding imagery-generation process that utilizes the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory. There are no logo shape effects on attribute judgments when the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory is constrained by irrelevant visual imagery, when people have a lower disposition to generate imagery when processing product information, and when the headline of the ad highlights a product attribute that differs from the inference drawn from the logo shape.

Recently consumer researchers have begun to debate the relevance of this concept for understanding brand-related communication on social media. Based on a data set of 8949 tweets about Louis Vuitton gathered on Italian Twitter in 2013, this article addresses these discussions by developing the alternative concept of brand publics that differ from brand communities in three important ways. First, brand publics are social formations that are not based on interaction but on a continuous focus of interest and mediation. Second, participation in brand publics is not structured by discussion or deliberation but by individual or collective affect. Third, in brand publics consumers do not develop a collective identity around the focal brand; rather the brand is valuable as a medium that can offer publicity to a multitude of diverse situations of identity. The conclusion suggests that brand publics might be part of a social media\u2013based consumer culture where publicity rather than identity has become a core value.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/5/727/1856841","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['diverse', 'identity', 'social formations', 'consumer culture']","The article discusses the concept of 'brand publics' and highlights the importance of diverse situations of identity in consumer culture, suggesting a moderate engagement with social themes.

However, consumers also often comparatively evaluate many different food products at once in more complex shopping environments (i.e., in comparative processing contexts). Directly addressing these important differences, the results of two online studies and two retail laboratory studies demonstrate that the effects of different types of front-of-package nutrition cues (objective vs. evaluative) vary across consumers\u2019 processing contexts (comparative vs. noncomparative). When consumers evaluate a single food item in a noncomparative context, objective nutrition cues that offer specific quantitative information lead to higher evaluations and intentions to purchase healthier products than do evaluative nutrition cues (which provide interpretive information about a product\u2019s overall healthfulness and/or nutrients). However, these effects are reversed when consumers evaluate multiple food items simultaneously in a comparative context, such that evaluative cues have a more positive impact on evaluations and purchase intentions of healthier products. The authors integrate processing fluency and resource matching theoretical frameworks to explain why evaluative (objective) front-of-package cues are more influential in comparative (noncomparative) processing contexts.

An investigation of the underlying process finds that scarcity salience activates a constraint mindset that persists and manifests itself through reduced functional fixedness in subsequent product usage contexts (i.e., makes consumers think beyond the traditional functionality of a given product), consequently enhancing product use creativity. This work advances the extant creativity literature, currently limited to examining the effects of context-specific resource constraints, by establishing a context-independent linkage between resource availability and product use creativity.

In a series of experiments, this study shows that mindfulness, an enhanced attention state, improves consumers\u2019 reliance on physiological cues across consumption episodes. Consumers who are chronically high in mindfulness (study 1) or who receive a short mindfulness training that focuses attention on the body (study 2) compensate more for previous food intake in their subsequent consumption. Moreover, after a mindful body meditation, consumers are more aware of physiological cues that develop after consumption (study 3), rather than of the amount they have previously eaten (study 4). Furthermore, we argue and show that the focus of mindfulness matters: mindfulness trainings that focus attention on the environment or on the body similarly elicit state mindfulness, but only mindful attention with a focus on the body stimulates compensation for previous consumption and awareness of satiety cues. Finally, practicing mindfulness and specifically paying mindful attention to body sensations is related to a more constant body weight in a sample of the general population (study 5).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/5/783/1858328","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['mindfulness', 'physiological cues', 'awareness']","The article discusses mindfulness and its impact on consumer behavior, which touches on ethical consumption and awareness of bodily cues.

Analyses of a data set covering 1272 products across 120 vertically differentiated product categories reveal that average user ratings (1) lack convergence with Consumer Reports scores, the most commonly used measure of objective quality in the consumer behavior literature, (2) are often based on insufficient sample sizes which limits their informativeness, (3) do not predict resale prices in the used-product marketplace, and (4) are higher for more expensive products and premium brands, controlling for Consumer Reports scores. However, when forming quality inferences and purchase intentions, consumers heavily weight the average rating compared to other cues for quality like price and the number of ratings. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the average user rating as a function of sample size sufficiency.

Building on the resource availability, product packaging, and psychological closure literature, the authors demonstrate across seven studies that when processing capacity is low, consuming a particular serving/dosage of a product from a smaller resource inventory (i.e., the entirety of a single-serve package) may subjectively feel more adequate than consuming the same amount from a larger resource inventory (i.e., a multi-serve package, namely one in which additional servings/doses remain after consumption). Results indicate that differences in felt consumption closure underlie perceptions of product adequacy.

A series of five experiments reveal that ethical purchases polarize moral judgments: whereas individuals receiving government assistance are perceived as less moral when choosing ethical (vs. conventional) products, income earners, particularly high-income individuals, are perceived as more moral for making the identical choice. Price is a central component of this effect because equating the cost of ethical and conventional goods provides those receiving government assistance some protection against harsh moral judgments when choosing ethically. Moreover, earning one\u2019s income drives perceptions of deservingness, or the right to spend as one desires. Those who receive assistance via taxpayer dollars are under greater scrutiny (frequently resulting in harsher moral judgments) by others. In addition to influencing perceptions of individual consumers, the results demonstrate that such attributions extend to groups who make ethical choices on others\u2019 behalf, and that these attributions have real monetary consequences for nonprofit organizations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/879/2358512","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['ethical', 'government assistance', 'moral judgments', 'deservingness', 'ethical purchases']","The article strongly emphasizes ethical consumerism and the moral implications of societal perceptions regarding low-income individuals receiving government assistance.

This work documents how creative control , the extent to which the same entity takes responsibility for all stages of the creative process, impacts which products are singled out for recognition but does not play a comparable role in determining what consumers like and thus purchase. Using real-world data, study 1 demonstrates how songs by performers who write their own material are more likely to garner acclaim but do not excel in terms of sales. Study 2 replicates the pattern of results in the lab. Study 3 reproduces the effect in a new domain (beer) using different measures of recognition. Study 4 shows creative authenticity , the extent to which a product is considered a faithful execution of its creator\u2019s vision, mediates the effect of creative control on recognition. Further, study 4 highlights the contingent role played by the perceived trustworthiness of the creator on this relationship. Finally, study 5 presents a boundary condition such that when consumers do not feel confident in their appraisals of an experience, creative control\u2019s impact on recognition and liking runs in parallel.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/897/2357911","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['creative control', 'authenticity', 'recognition']","The article discusses themes of creative control and authenticity, which touch on the broader implications of how recognition is influenced by the creator's vision.

The outcome of these self-evaluations depends on the standard consumers use and on whether they evaluate \u201cself\u201d in assimilation or contrast to that standard. Previous self-judgment research has focused on self-standards that arise from social aspects of the environment including people and groups. We propose that self-judgment is sometimes made relative to other standards that originate from different aspects of the environment, namely material objects, including products and goods. Two experiments demonstrate that consumers classify products they own as \u201cself\u201d and products they do not own as \u201cnot-self.\u201d Consequently, consumers judge their own physical and personal traits (e.g., height, sincerity) in assimilation to traits of products they own, but in contrast to traits of products they do not own, even following imposed ownership, when a person acquires an object they may not have chosen themselves. Extending this paradigm, experiment 3 shows that simply wearing products can evoke ephemeral felt ownership, leading to consumers taking on product traits. We discuss implications for modern consumers, who often acquire objects inadvertently through gifts and are frequently exposed to products they do not own through advertisements.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/915/2358648","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-evaluation', 'consumption', 'social aspects']","The article explores consumer self-evaluation in relation to ownership and social standards, touching on social aspects of the environment.

Five field and laboratory studies demonstrate that this performance brand effect emerges through psychological mechanisms unrelated to functional product differences, consistent with a placebo. Furthermore, whereas this effect emerges only when there is an expectation that the performance branded product affects outcomes, consumers attribute gains to themselves. The performance brand placebo is due to a lowering of task-induced anxiety, driven by heightened state self-esteem. Several theoretically relevant boundaries are revealed. Stress mindset moderates the effect, strengthening with the belief that stress is debilitating and weakening (to the point of reversal) with the belief that stress is enhancing. Moreover, those consumers lower in preexisting domain self-efficacy beliefs exhibit more substantial performance gains, whereas for those particularly high in domain self-efficacy, the placebo is mitigated.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/931/2358047","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['performance', 'self-esteem', 'anxiety']","The article focuses primarily on the psychological mechanisms behind brand performance and consumer attribution, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

With regard to health and academic goals, we find that attending to the immediate rewards of health and academic activities increases persistence in these activities to a greater extent than attending to delayed rewards, even though these activities are selected for the delayed rewards they provide. Specifically, bringing immediate rewards into activity choice\u2014for example, having participants choose the most enjoyable rather than the most useful exercise or the tastier rather than healthier bag of carrots\u2014increases persistence and consumption. Similarly, adding external immediate rewards to activity pursuit\u2014for example, playing music in a high school classroom\u2014increases persistence. Across these studies, immediate rewards are stronger predictors of activity persistence than delayed rewards. This research suggests that marketers and consumers can harness immediate rewards to increase persistence in long-term goals.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/952/2358882","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['immediate rewards', 'long-term goals', 'persistence']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and marketing strategies related to immediate versus delayed rewards, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

But might the new tools people are using\u2014quantifying life\u2014 rob them of some of the benefits of engaging in those activities? Six experiments demonstrate that while measurement increases how much of an activity people do (e.g., walk or read more), it can simultaneously reduce how much people enjoy those activities. This occurs because measurement can undermine intrinsic motivation. By drawing attention to output, measurement can make enjoyable activities feel more like work, which reduces their enjoyment. As a result, measurement can decrease continued engagement in the activity and subjective well-being. Even in the absence of explicit external incentives, measurement itself can thus have similar effects. The findings have implications for measurement\u2019s use, as well as for the psychology of external incentives and intrinsic motivation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/42/6/967/2358309","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['measurement', 'intrinsic motivation', 'well-being']","The article discusses the impact of personal quantification on enjoyment and well-being, touching on themes of intrinsic motivation and subjective well-being, which align with moderate ethical considerations.

The overall spillover can be either positive or negative, depending on the weight of common skill and correlation of noise in returns. Its absolute value increases with family size, and declines over time. The sensitivity of flows to a fund's own performance is affected accordingly.

Using data on individual corporate debt issues between 1987 and 2009, we find that gap-filling behavior is more prominent in the very long end of the maturity spectrum where the required risk capital makes arbitrage costly.

A positive idiosyncratic shock decreases the sensitivity of firm value to priced risk factors and simultaneously increases firm size and idiosyncratic risk. A simple model can therefore explain book-to-market and size anomalies, as well as the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns. Empirically, we find that anomalies are more pronounced for firms with high idiosyncratic cash flow volatility. More generally, our results imply that any economic variable correlated with the history of idiosyncratic shocks can help to explain expected stock returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12280","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial concepts and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effect\u2014the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses\u2014applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors' cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds.

We propose a risk-based explanation for this phenomenon, whereby investors use announcements to revise their expectations for nonannouncing firms, but can only do so imperfectly. Consequently, the covariance between firm-specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns. Nonannouncers' response to announcements is consistent with our model, both over time and across firms. Finally, exposure to announcement risk is priced.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12361","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the relationship between earnings announcements and systematic risk, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2016","71","1","ASLI M.

A life-cycle model of insurance choice simplifies to replicating the optimal health and mortality delta through a portfolio of insurance products. We estimate the model to explain the observed variation in health and mortality delta implied by the ownership of life insurance, annuities including private pensions, and long-term care insurance in the Health and Retirement Study. For the median household aged 51 to 57, the lifetime welfare cost of market incompleteness and suboptimal choice is 3.2% of total wealth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12273","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of insurance choice and economic modeling without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

In our setting, directors affect their firms' governance, and governance in turn affects firms' demand for new directors. Whether the labor market rewards a shareholder-friendly or management-friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors' desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across firms. Directors' reputational concerns amplify the governance system: strong systems become stronger and weak systems become weaker. We derive implications for multiple directorships, board size, transparency, and board independence.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12287","articles","JF","Finance","2","['governance', 'directors', 'reputational concerns']","The article focuses primarily on corporate governance and the labor market for directors without emphasizing social justice or ethical critiques.

Using segment-level capital allocation in multisegment firms (\u201cconglomerates\u201d) as a laboratory, we show that capital expenditure is increasing in the expected skewness of segment returns. Conglomerates invest more in high-skewness segments than matched stand-alone firms, and trade at a discount, which indicates overinvestment that is detrimental to shareholder wealth. Using geographical variation in gambling norms, we find that the skewness-investment relation is particularly pronounced when CEOs are likely to find long shots attractive.

Using a unique data set from a large bank containing timely assessments of collateral values, we find that the bank responded to a legal reform that exogenously reduced collateral values by increasing interest rates, tightening credit limits, and reducing the intensity of its monitoring of borrowers and collateral, spurring borrower delinquency on outstanding claims. We thus explain why banks are senior lenders and quantify the value of claimant priority.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12214","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of collateral and debt contracts without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

I study the residential mortgage market, where property developers often cooperate with vertically integrated mortgage lenders to offer financing to buyers of new homes. I show that these integrated lenders have superior information about the construction quality of individual homes and exploit this information to lend against higher quality collateral, decreasing foreclosures by up to 40%.

This paper exploits a natural experiment from the 18 century in which information flows were regularly interrupted for exogenous reasons. English shares were traded on the Amsterdam exchange and news came in on sailboats that were often delayed because of adverse weather conditions. The paper documents that prices responded strongly to boat arrivals, but there was considerable volatility in the absence of news. The evidence suggests that this was largely the result of the revelation of (long-lived) private information and the (transitory) impact of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries' risk premia.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12312","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset price volatility without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We document similar return seasonalities in anomalies, commodities, and international stock market indices, as well as at the daily frequency. The seasonalities overwhelm unconditional differences in expected returns. The correlations between different seasonality strategies are modest, suggesting that they emanate from different systematic factors. Our results suggest that seasonalities are not a distinct class of anomalies that requires an explanation of its own, but rather that they are intertwined with other return anomalies through shared systematic factors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12398","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of stock returns and anomalies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

To isolate political uncertainty, we exploit its variation around national elections and global summits. We find that political uncertainty is priced in the equity option market as predicted by theory. Options whose lives span political events tend to be more expensive. Such options provide valuable protection against the price, variance, and tail risks associated with political events. This protection is more valuable in a weaker economy and amid higher political uncertainty. The effects of political uncertainty spill over across countries.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12406","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of political uncertainty in the finance sector without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

The model highlights the diverse effects of IC investment on expected returns in different postinvestment regimes and yields the novel prediction that, under the neoclassical assumption of nonincreasing revenue returns, IC investment is positively related to subsequent cumulative stock returns with a lag. The model also predicts a positive effect of IC investment on future investment and profitability.

The Role of Conditional Return Asymmetry","We propose a quantile-based measure of conditional skewness, particularly suitable for handling recalcitrant emerging market (EM) returns. The skewness of international stock market returns varies significantly across countries over time, and persists at long horizons. In EMs, skewness is mostly positive and idiosyncratic, and significantly relates to a country's financial and trade openness and balance of payments. In an international portfolio setting, return asymmetry leads to sizeable certainty-equivalent gains and increases the weight on emerging countries to about 30%. Investing in EMs seems to be about expectations of a higher upside than downside, consistent with recent theories.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12420","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and investment strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2016","71","5","ITAMAR DRECHSLER,\u00a0\n                     ITAMAR DRECHSLERSearch for more papers by this authorTHOMAS DRECHSEL,\u00a0\n                     THOMAS DRECHSELSearch for more papers by this authorDAVID MARQUES-IBANEZ,\u00a0\n                     DAVID MARQUES-IBANEZSearch for more papers by this authorPHILIPP SCHNABL,\u00a0\n                     PHILIPP SCHNABL\n                     Itamar Drechsler is with NYU Stern and NBER.

Using a novel data set on all central bank lending and collateral, we show that weakly capitalized banks took out more LOLR loans and used riskier collateral than strongly capitalized banks. We also find that weakly capitalized banks used LOLR loans to buy risky assets such as distressed sovereign debt. This resulted in a reallocation of risky assets from strongly to weakly capitalized banks. Our findings cannot be explained by classical LOLR theory. Rather, they point to risk taking by banks, both independently and with the encouragement of governments, and highlight the benefit of unifying LOLR lending and bank supervision.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12421","articles","JF","Finance","2","['risk', 'banks', 'government']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial lending and risk management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We exploit regional variation in mortgage advertising induced by the entry of Craigslist and other tests to demonstrate that these findings are not spurious.

Our explanation is that high-beta assets are prone to speculative overpricing. When investors disagree about the stock market's prospects, high-beta assets are more sensitive to this aggregate disagreement, experience greater divergence of opinion about their payoffs, and are overpriced due to short-sales constraints. When aggregate disagreement is low, the Security Market Line is upward-sloping due to risk-sharing. When it is high, expected returns can actually decrease with beta.

Households decrease holdings in fraudulent as well as nonfraudulent firms, even if they do not hold stocks in fraudulent firms. Within a state, households with more lifetime experience of corporate fraud hold less equity. Following the exogenous increase in fraud revelation due to Arthur Andersen's demise, states with more Arthur Andersen clients experience a larger decrease in stock market participation.

To better understand the challenge in distinguishing investors' beliefs from risk-adjusted discounting, we use Perron\u2013Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive martingale component of the stochastic discount factor process. This component recovers a probability measure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments. When the martingale is not degenerate, surmising that this recovered probability captures investors' beliefs distorts inference about risk-return tradeoffs. Stochastic discount factors in many structural models of asset prices have empirically relevant martingale components.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12404","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and investor behavior without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

Flows into a fund are predicted by the manager's performance in his other fund, especially when he outperforms and when signals from the other fund are more useful. In equilibrium, capital should be allocated such that there is no cross-fund predictability. However, we find positive predictability, particularly among underperforming funds.

While the targets of failed cash and stock offers are both more likely to be acquired over the following eight years than matched control firms, no differences exist between cash and stock targets, either in the timing or in the value of future offers. Similarly, we cannot detect differential operational policies following the failed bid. Our results are most consistent with cash bids revealing prior undervaluation of the target.

The remainder stems from the cross-sectional variation in mean forecast errors and in analysts\u2019 estimation errors of the persistence of earnings growth shocks. Consistent with our model, we find that analysts learn about some features of the earnings process but not others, and this learning reduces, but does not eliminate, the autocorrelation of forecast errors as firms age. Other potential explanations for the autocorrelation of analyst forecast errors are rejected. Our model of robust forecasting applies not only to analysts\u2019 forecasts but also to all model-based forecasts.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X16300629","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial forecasting and model uncertainty without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We hypothesize that investment banking networks allow lead IPO underwriters to induce institutions to pay attention to the firms they take public and to perform two information-related roles during the IPO process: an information dissemination role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to disseminate noisy information about various aspects of the IPO firm to institutional investors; and an information extraction role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to extract information useful in pricing the IPO firm equity from institutional investors. Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated with larger absolute values of offer price revisions, greater IPO and after-market valuations, larger IPO initial returns, greater institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately post-IPO, greater stock liquidity post-IPO, and better long-run stock returns. Using a hand-collected data set of pre-IPO media coverage as a proxy for investor attention, we show that an important channel through which more central lead IPO underwriters achieve favorable IPO characteristics is by attracting greater investor attention to the IPOs underwritten by them.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X1630126X","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investment banking and IPO characteristics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

I argue that domestic firms suffer a liability of localness in innovation, or a competitive disadvantage in product innovation relative to subsidiaries of foreign firms. I propose that this liability of localness is driven by the relatively lower levels of multiculturalism in employees of domestic firms in comparison with subsidiaries, which limit the identification, transfer, and integration of a large diversity of knowledge that supports product innovation. I also propose that managers of domestic firms can compensate for this liability of localness in two ways: by investing in the training of their employees and by exporting. Training modifies the mindsets and abilities of employees and enables them to become more cognitively multicultural, which facilitates product innovation. Exporting changes employees\u2019 mindsets as they become exposed to new ideas available abroad, which also facilitates product innovation. I test these arguments on a sample of manufacturing firms and find that, although domestic firms introduce fewer new products than subsidiaries of foreign firms, they introduce more new products than subsidiaries at the same level of investment in language training and of exports.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2015.24","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","5","['multiculturalism', 'diversity', 'innovation', 'training']","The article discusses the impact of multiculturalism and diversity on innovation within firms, highlighting the importance of cognitive multiculturalism in enhancing product innovation.

Transaction cost theorizing helps explain the social forces that link cultural group boundaries with country boundaries. Firm resource theory can be informed by the toolbox metaphor to understand cultural patterns in the resources that firms in a particular locale have most readily available.

Because of this, ibusiness firms face different challenges when they internationalize compared with traditional firms, even those online. In this article we extend existing internationalization theory to encompass this new type of organization. We theorize that because ibusiness firms produce value through the creation and coordination of a network of users, these firms tend to suffer greater liabilities of outsidership when expanding abroad and therefore concentrate on network and diffusion-based user adoption processes as they internationalize. Based on a multi-case investigation of a sample of ibusiness firms, we develop new theory and testable hypotheses.

We hypothesize that, when the above mechanisms are not available, firms are more likely to fragment processes across multiple foreign production units instead of collocating all process tasks in the same unit. Thanks to IT-enabled integration capabilities, firms can exploit the complementarities between the dispersed fragments of a process while reducing the misappropriation hazard of individual fragments. Empirical results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with these hypotheses. We find also that the propensity to turn to the process fragmentation protection mechanism increases with firm host-country-specific experience and with the alternative value of the proprietary information involved in the activity sourced abroad.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jibs.2015.44","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on operational adjustments for information protection in foreign business contexts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This article examines the extent to which inter-firm governance in ITAs shapes TSU, and whether the development of TSU is endangered by cultural distance. We hypothesize that relational governance, product modularity, and cultural distance influence TSU development, which in turn influences firm performance. We collected data from 110 non-equity ITAs between software and hardware firms participating in the mobile device sector. We analyzed the data using partial least squares path modeling. Our findings suggest that TSU largely depends on product modularity and relational governance in alliances. However, while cultural distance negatively moderates the path from relational governance to TSU, it has no effect on the relationship between product modularity and TSU. Based on this, we conclude that product modularity can substitute for relational governance when strong relational norms are not well-developed in international alliances.

In countries with a low level of state fragility, it was less costly to serve the poor, which decreased pressure on commercial actors to shift to wealthier clients to achieve profitability.

Integrating international business studies with both corporate finance literature on family firms and recent contributions from the Socio Emotional Wealth perspective on family ownership, we claim that, due to greater risk aversion and lower access to information, the family involvement both in the firm ownership and management leads to a higher propensity towards greenfield initiatives (vs acquisitions).

In theory, exporting represents a major commitment, and is often the starting point for further internationalization. However, intermittent exporters exit and subsequently re-enter exporting, sometimes frequently. We develop a conceptual model to explain how firm characteristics and market conditions interact to affect the decision to exit and re-enter exporting, and model this process using an extensive dataset of French manufacturing firms from 1997 to 2007. As anticipated, smaller and less productive firms are more likely to exit exporting, and react more strongly to changes in both domestic and foreign markets than larger firms. Exit and re-entry are closely linked. Firms with a low exit probability also have a high likelihood of re-entry, and vice versa. However, the way in which firms react to market conditions at the time of exit matters greatly in determining the likelihood of re-entry: thus re-entry depends crucially on the strategic rationale for exit. Our analysis helps explain the opportunistic and intermittent exporting of (mainly) small firms, the demand conditions under which intermittent exporting is most likely to occur, and the firm attributes most likely to give rise to such behavior.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-016-0015-2","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of exporting behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study investigates how the predictors of cross-border M&A completion involving emerging markets depend upon the direction of global expansion, i.e., investment inbound to a developing market or outbound from a developing market. Analysis based on 15\u00a0years of data from four emerging economies, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, from 1995 to 2010, reveals fundamental differences in the predictors of inbound vs. outbound M&A completion. Country-level factors reflecting differences in political, trade, and legal environments strongly affect the completion for inbound M&As, but have a much weaker influence on outbound M&As. By contrast, firm-level factors such as past M&A experience have a significantly stronger effect on completion for outbound than for inbound M&As. Most interestingly, two deal-level factors (the percentage of stake sought by the acquirer and whether or not the deal is a cash transaction) increase the likelihood of completion for inbound but decrease it for outbound M&As. These findings have important managerial implications for enhancing the success of global expansions.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-016-0027-y","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","2","['emerging markets', 'cross-border', 'M&As']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of cross-border mergers and acquisitions without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we examine changes in firms\u2019 dividend payouts following a plausibly exogenous shock to the threat of takeover with the staggered initiation of country-level merger and acquisition (M&A) laws. Using a global sample of firms across 34 countries, we find that both the likelihood and the amount of dividends decrease significantly after the initiation of an M&A law in a country. Our cross-sectional analyses indicate that the negative effect of M&A laws on dividend payouts is amplified in countries where the institutional environment enables M&A laws to improve the takeover market and for firms that could readily use internal capital to finance growth opportunities. Moreover, this negative effect is attenuated for firms with already sufficient monitoring of managers. These findings suggest that the enactment of M&A laws, by strengthening the market for corporate control, lowered the need for firms to convey their commitment to shareholders\u2019 interests through costly dividend payments, especially when the threat of takeover prompted by M&A laws is likely to serve as an effective disciplinary mechanism.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-016-0028-x","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate control and dividend policies without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate new product introductions using a multimethod design consisting of a survey of manufacturers and a repeated measures experiment with retailers. The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasingly specific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity are higher. When they are lower, the positive influence of new product creativity on contract specificity weakens and can in some instances become negative. The results also indicate that there is no significant change in a retailer's relational behaviors throughout a contract's duration when contract specificity is lower, regardless of the new product's success.

By assembling one of the most comprehensive data sets in the brand communications literature with corporate communications, news stories, social media, and business outcomes, the authors document the echoverse (i.e., feedback loops between all of these sources). Furthermore, the echoverse has changed as online word of mouth has become prevalent. Over time, online word of mouth has fallen into a negativity spiral, with negative messages leading to greater volume, and firms are adjusting their communications strategies in response. The nature of brand communications has been transformed by online technology as corporate communications move increasingly from one to many (e.g., advertising) to one to one (e.g., Twitter) while consumer word of mouth moves from one to one (e.g., conversations) to one to many (e.g., social media). The results indicate that companies benefit from using social media (e.g., Twitter) for personalized customer responses, although there is still a role for traditional brand communications (e.g., press releases, advertising).

For the premium tier, retailers\u2019 propensity to use store-banner branding is higher when they have a hi\u2013lo price format and a higher brand equity, and when they have used store-banner branding in the past (on their standard tier and in other markets). The attractiveness of using store-banner branding for the premium tier also varies across countries: it is more likely to be chosen when the retail environment is less concentrated, when uncertainty avoidance and rule of law are higher, and when power distance is lower. For most of these drivers, the effect is significantly weaker for the economy tier. Retailers whose premium-tier branding decision is congruent with the proposed contingency framework perform better.

This study is the first to challenge the assumption of a negative decay in DVD performance as a function of time; its results suggest that a delayed DVD release is still optimal for maximizing revenue in the DVD channel. This study's model suggests that, on average, individual movies are approximately eight weeks away from their optimal lag and that the net impact of optimizing would be improvements in total and DVD revenue by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively.

The authors extend the literature with an analytical model showing that value-added resellers limit the number and composition of additions to gain better upstream terms.

The authors apply a multivariate hidden Markov model to a six-year longitudinal data set of 552 business-to-business relationships maintained by a Fortune 500 firm. The analysis identifies four latent buyer\u2013seller relationship states, according to each customer's level of commitment, trust, dependence, and relational norms, and it parsimoniously captures customers\u2019 migration across relationship states through three positive (exploration, endowment, recovery) and two negative (neglect, betrayal) migration mechanisms. The most effective RM strategies across migration paths can help firms promote customer migration to higher performance states and prevent deterioration to poorer ones. A counterfactual elasticity analysis compares the relative importance of different migration strategies at various relationship stages. This research thus moves beyond extant RM literature by focusing on the differential effectiveness of RM strategies across relationship states, and it provides managerial guidance regarding efficient, dynamic resource allocations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.15.0066","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['relationship marketing', 'commitment', 'trust']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of relationship marketing and customer dynamics without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using 15 years of audited returns, the authors find convincing empirical evidence that stock returns on customer satisfaction do beat the market. The recorded cumulative returns were 518% over the years studied (2000\u20132014), compared with a 31% increase for the S&P 500. Similar results using back-tested instead of real returns were found in the United Kingdom. The effect of customer satisfaction on stock price is, at least in part, channeled through earnings surprises. Consistent with theory, customer satisfaction has an effect on earnings themselves. In addition, the authors examine the effect of stock returns from earnings on stock returns from customer satisfaction. If earnings returns are included among the risk factors in the asset pricing model, the earnings variable partially mitigates the returns on customer satisfaction. Because of the long time series, it is also possible to examine time periods when customer satisfaction returns were below market. The reversal of the general trend largely resulted from short-term market idiosyncrasies with little or no support from fundamentals.

In this research, the authors decompose users\u2019 viewing behavior into (1) whether the user continues the viewing session after each episode viewed, (2) whether the next episode viewed is from the same or a different series, and (3) the time elapsed between sessions. Applying this modeling framework to data provided by Hulu.com, a popular online provider of broadcast and cable television shows, the authors examine the drivers of binge watching behavior, distinguishing between user-level traits and states determined by previously viewed content. The authors simultaneously investigate users\u2019 response to advertisements. Many online video providers support their services with advertising revenue; thus, understanding how users respond to advertisements and how advertising affects subsequent viewing is of paramount importance to both advertisers and online video providers.

Toward that end, marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second, customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value, in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore, marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions.

The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000.

In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice.

This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that marketing uses attitudinal (e.g., brand awareness), behavioral (e.g., brand loyalty), and financial (e.g., sales revenue) performance metrics, which do not correlate highly with each other. Thus, one metric could view marketing initiatives as successful, whereas another could interpret them as a waste of resources. The resulting ambiguity has several consequences for marketing practice. Among these are that the scope and objectives of marketing differ widely across organizations. There is confusion about the difference between marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Hard and soft metrics and offline and online metrics are typically not integrated. The two dominant tools for marketing impact assessment, response models and experiments, are rarely combined. Risk in marketing planning and execution receives little consideration, and analytic insights are not communicated effectively to drive decisions. The authors first examine how these factors affect both research and practice.

Their findings show that these reactions function in a relatively automatic fashion, even emerging under conditions in which the packaging damage does not convey information about a health and safety threat from the product. The authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these thoughts of contamination. This can be done with positive brand associations (i.e., by branding the product as organic) or by creating a physical buffer between the packaging damage and the product itself.

Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food) on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained) eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.12.0429","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['fitness branding', 'restrained eaters', 'food consumption']","The article discusses the impact of fitness branding on consumer behavior, particularly among restrained eaters, but does not emphasize social justice or critical theory.

The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing).

They also show that incidental exposures arising from the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices.

In this article, the authors examine the effectiveness of such retention campaigns using a large-scale field experiment in which some customers are offered plan recommendations and some are not. They find that being proactive and encouraging customers to switch to cost-minimizing plans can, surprisingly, increase rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only 6% of customers in the control condition churned during the three months following the intervention, 10% did so in the treatment group. The authors propose two explanations for how the campaign increased churn, namely, (1) by lowering customers\u2019 inertia to switch plans and (2) by increasing the salience of past-usage patterns among potential churners.

In this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.13.0004","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['consumer preferences', 'financial decision making', 'inflation protection']","The article focuses on consumer financial decision-making regarding annuities, with an emphasis on attributes like inflation protection.

However, studies that have investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value.

First, they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty. This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal\u2013agent models that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse. Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary to the standard principal\u2013agent model. Third, they provide intuition for this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random. When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random demand. When the customers\u2019 response to effort (or price) is random, the decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to agents\u2019 risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case, higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard principal\u2013agent models.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.13.0506","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on sales management and profit optimization without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a \u201ccontractual externality\u201d in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0018","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['heterogeneous', 'agents', 'compensation']","The article discusses the implications of employee heterogeneity and compensation structures, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of contract optimization rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

The findings contribute to research that investigates differences between offline WOM and online WOM. The authors find that the relationship of WOM valence with purchase intentions is exacerbated when the conversation occurs offline, whereas offline conversations tend to be more strongly associated with WOM retransmission intentions regardless of the conversation's valence. The results also provide insights into how interpersonal characteristics influence WOM outcomes.

In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects\u2019 tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon.

Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller when consumers receive additional information about time savings through product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time savings.

For most people, this process encourages the choice of the most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal, and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the alternative that is most efficacious for the goal.

They demonstrate that when negotiators expect a role reversal, they are likely to make more concessions and reach agreement more quickly in the current negotiation. The authors find that this effect is driven by negotiators\u2019 beliefs that they will be able to recover these concessions, because negotiators expect their counterparts to reciprocate in the later transaction when the parties reverse roles. However, when the two negotiations occur in different \u201caccounting\u201d periods (i.e., fiscal periods) or when the negotiating parties do not explicitly communicate their willingness to reverse roles in the future, role-reversal expectations do not affect concession making.

This research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone.

The first study, a secondary data analysis, finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed orders. The third study compares orders for truly immediate consumption versus orders placed in advance and demonstrates a significant (100 calorie, or approximately 10%) reduction in lunch calories.

For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand's exact rank.

Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0379","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['expectations', 'consumer response', 'marketing communications']","The article primarily focuses on marketing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

For example, the effectiveness of eWOM on social media platforms is stronger when eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity to eWOM senders, whereas these homophily details do not influence the effectiveness of eWOM for e-commerce platforms. In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services.

Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations\u2019 margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented.

Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory\u2013driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood.

He finds that ads increase the chances of sales for nonadvertised restaurants significantly. The spillover benefits are concentrated on restaurants that serve the advertiser's cuisine and have a high rating on the restaurant-search website. The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader reminder.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0274","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and its impact on sales without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices.

Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative.

Yet there are times when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest rate credit option varies as a function of the savings\u2019 intended use.

However, perceived economic mobility functions in the opposite manner when the purchase is a means to achieve financial success. The authors trace this effect to the self-regulation process of materialistic consumers, such that when perceiving high economic mobility, these consumers regulate their behavior toward long-term financial success, sacrificing the pleasure of acquisitions in the present.

Using a quantal response equilibrium model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players\u2019 decisions, or by the exogenous game structure. To do so, the authors compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal, which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players, significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel members have fairly different payoffs.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.12.0093","research article","JMR","Marketing","6","['fairness', 'equity', 'social norms', 'distributive fairness']","The article discusses fairness concerns and distributive fairness principles, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations in business practices.

Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner.

The authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu) makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by \u201croughly scheduling\u201d (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity.

Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and conventional CLV approaches.

The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price.

Like the TI model, the new model, called the bucket indexed (BI) model, partitions the planning horizon into periods of equal length, or buckets. Unlike the TI model, the length of a period is a parameter of the BI model and can be chosen to be as long as the processing time of the shortest job. The two models are equivalent if a period is of unit length, but when longer periods are used in the BI model, it can have significantly fewer variables and nonzeros than the corresponding TI model. A computational study using weighted tardiness instances, and weighted completion time instances with release dates, reveals that the BI model significantly outperforms the TI model on instances where the minimum processing time of the jobs is large.

However, the research literature has been largely silent on the topic of recommendation stability in other important types of settings, such as classification-oriented (i.e., where it is important to accurately classify the item as relevant versus irrelevant, without having to quantify the user\u2019s preference precisely), ranking-oriented (i.e., where it is important to provide accurate relative ranking of items to users), or top-K oriented (i.e., where it is important to suggest K items that are most appealing to the user). Therefore, this paper builds on prior work by generalizing the notion of stability to a broader set of recommendation settings and developing corresponding stability metrics.

However, generating test data for floating-point intensive programs proved to be a challenging problem. Existing approaches usually resort to random or search-based test data generation, but without symbolic reasoning it is almost impossible to generate test inputs that execute complex paths controlled by floating-point computations. Moreover, because constraint solvers over the reals or the rationals do not natively support the handling of rounding errors, the need arises for efficient constraint solvers over floating-point domains.

The use of high-level metaconstraints in the problem formulation can achieve a substantial share of these computational gains by better communicating problem structure to the solver.

For dynamic models in which uncertainty is resolved at more than one stage, however, using coherent risk measures within a standard single-level optimization framework becomes problematic. To avoid severe time-consistency difficulties, the current state of the art is to employ risk measures of a specific nested form, which unfortunately have some undesirable and somewhat counterintuitive modeling properties. This paper summarizes the potential drawbacks of nested-form risk measure issues and then presents an alternative multilevel optimization modeling approach that enforces a form of time consistency through constraints rather than by restricting the modeler\u2019s choice of objective function. This technique leads to models that are time consistent even while using time-inconsistent risk measures and can easily be formulated to be law invariant with respect to the final wealth if so desired. We argue that this approach should be the starting point for all multistage optimization modeling. When used with time-consistent objective functions, we show its multilevel optimization constraints become redundant, and the associated models thus simplify to a more familiar single-objective form. Unfortunately, we also show that our proposed approach leads to \ud835\udca9\ud835\udcab-hard models, even in the simplest imaginable setting in which it would be needed: three-stage linear problems on a finite probability space, using the standard average value-at-risk and first-order mean-semideviation risk measures. Finally, we show that for a simple but reasonably realistic test application, the kind of models we propose, although drawn from an \ud835\udca9\ud835\udcab-hard family and certainly more time consuming to solve than those obtained from the nested-objective approach, are readily solvable to global optimality using a standard commercial mixed-integer linear programming solver. Therefore, there seems some promise of our proposed modeling approach being useful despite its computational complexity properties.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0665","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization modeling and risk measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In particular, we can deal with discrete scenario based uncertainty, gamma uncertainty, and ellipsoidal uncertainty. For this general class of robust critical node selection problems, we propose an exact solution method based on Benders decomposition.

Generalized disjunctive programs are traditionally reformulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems using either the big M (BM) or the hull reformulation (HR). The former yields a smaller MILP/MINLP problem, whereas the latter yields a tighter one. The HR can be further strengthened by using the concept of basic step from disjunctive programming. The proposed algorithm uses the strengthened formulation to derive cuts for the big-M formulation, generating a stronger formulation with small growth in problem size. We test the algorithm with several instances. The results show that the algorithm improves generalized disjunctive programming convex models, in the sense of providing formulations with stronger continuous relaxations than the BM formulation, with few additional constraints. In general, the algorithm also leads to a reduction in the solution time of the problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0669","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for optimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

This approach is an effective and efficient approximation that selects reviews iteratively to add to the ranking lists in light of expected consistency value, superiority, and execution time.

As a result, the usual selection policy of choosing the design with the largest sample mean as the estimate of the best is no longer necessarily optimal. Rather, the optimal selection policy is to choose the design that maximizes the posterior integrated probability of correct selection, which is a function of the posterior mean and the correlation structure induced by the posterior variance. Because determining the optimal selection policy is generally intractable, we also devise an approximation scheme to efficiently approximate the optimal selection policy. For the allocation policy, we study an asymptotic policy called general Bayesian budget allocation, which is comprised of a sampling statistic and a sequential rule. The optimal computing budget allocation algorithm can be interpreted as a special case of the asymptotical sampling statistics.

Among various simulation methods for estimating the Greeks, the pathwise method typically has a low variance. However, when the option payoff is discontinuous, the pathwise method is not applicable and the Greek involves a conditional expectation taken over a hypersurface that is a probability-zero set. In this paper, we propose an importance sampling (IS) method to estimate this conditional expectation. More specifically, IS is applied in a way that all simulated observations fall into a set constructed by thickening the hypersurface. Allowing the thickness of the set to go to zero then leads to a new representation of the Greek as an ordinary expectation, thus leading to an unbiased estimator. The resulting estimator makes use of the pathwise derivatives and can be viewed as an extension of the pathwise method to cases with discontinuous payoffs.

The goal is to determine a service policy to maximize the long-run reward rate earned from serving customers net of holding costs and penalties respectively due to customers waiting for and leaving before receiving service. We first show that it is without loss of generality to study a pure-reward model. Since standard methods can usually only compute the optimal policy for problems with up to three customer classes, our focus is to develop a suite of heuristic approaches, with a preference for operationally simple policies with good reward characteristics. One such heuristic is the R\u03bc\u03b8 rule\u2014a priority policy that ranks all customer classes based on the product of reward R, service rate \u03bc, and abandonment rate \u03b8. We show that the R\u03bc\u03b8 rule is asymptotically optimal as customer abandonment rates approach zero and often performs well in cases where the simpler R\u03bc rule performs poorly. The paper also develops an approximate policy improvement method that uses simulation and interpolation to estimate the bias function for use in a dynamic programming recursion. For systems with two or three customer classes, our numerical study indicates that the best of our simple priority policies is near optimal in most cases; when it is not, the approximate policy improvement method invariably tightens up the gap substantially. For systems with five customer classes, our heuristics typically achieve within 4% of an upper bound for the optimal value, which is computed via a linear program that relies on a relaxation of the original system. The computational requirement of the approximate policy improvement method grows rapidly when the number of customer classes or the traffic intensity increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0675","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queuing models and service policies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The concept of k-cores was introduced in social network analysis to identify denser portions of a social network. We exploit the graph-theoretic properties of this model to introduce a new approach to survivable interhub network design via spanning k-cores; the model preserves connectivity and diameter under limited edge failures. The deterministic version of the problem is polynomial-time solvable due to its equivalence to generalized graph matching. We propose two conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constrained optimization models to obtain risk-averse solutions for the minimum spanning k-core problem under probabilistic edge failures.

A decomposition and branch-and-cut approach is then developed to solve the scenario-based approximation of the CVaR-constrained minimum spanning k-core problem for the aforementioned loss functions. The computational performance of the algorithm is investigated via numerical experiments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0679","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem in graph theory and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because modern cloud systems operate in an open and dynamic world characterized by continuous changes, the development of efficient resource provisioning policies for cloud-based services becomes increasingly challenging. This paper aims to study the hourly basis service provisioning problem through a generalized Nash game model. We take the perspective of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers that want to minimize the costs associated with the virtual machine instances allocated in a multiple Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) scenario while avoiding incurring penalties for execution failures and providing quality of service guarantees. SaaS providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources, whereas the IaaSs want to maximize their revenues obtained providing virtualized resources. We propose a solution algorithm based on the best-reply dynamics, which is suitable for a distributed implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing numerical tests, considering multiple workloads and system configurations. Results show that our algorithm is scalable and provides significant cost savings with respect to alternative methods (5% on average but up to 260% for individual SaaS providers). Furthermore, varying the number of IaaS providers means an 8%\u201315% cost savings can be achieved from the workload distribution on multiple IaaSs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0681","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cloud computing and resource provisioning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Otherwise, approximation is necessary to solve stochastic programs with a large or infinite number of scenarios to a desired level of accuracy. This involves statistical sampling or deterministic selection of a finite set of scenarios to obtain a tractable deterministic equivalent problem. Some of these approaches rely on bounds for primal and dual decision variables of the second stage. We develop new algorithms to improve these bounds and reduce the deterministic approximation error. Experiments were conducted to compare a sequential approximation approach with and without these new algorithms. Each algorithm is applied to a set of test instances for a problem of managing semiconductor inventory with downward substitutions, where random variables only appear in the right-hand side of the second stage. Experiments were also conducted using a sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm. The sequential approximation and SAA algorithm generate a feasible solution upon termination.

In the second formulation, columns correspond to tours that are built in a two-phase procedure. The first phase involves the composition of daily shifts; the second assembles those shifts to generate tours using a shortest path problem with resource constraints. Both formulations are flexible enough to allow different start times, lengths, and days-off patterns, as well as multiple breaks and continuity and discontinuity in labor requirements.

In this work, we are interested in data aggregation, where the sink node wants to know the value for a certain function of all sensed data, such as minimum, maximum, average, and summation. Given a data aggregation tree, sensors receive messages from children periodically, merge them with its own packet, and send the new packet to its parent. The problem of finding an aggregation tree with the maximum lifetime has been proved to be NP-hard and can be generalized to finding a spanning tree with the minimum maximum vertex load, where the load of a vertex is a nondecreasing function of its degree in the tree. Although there is a rich body of research in those problems, they either fail to meet a theoretical bound or need high running time. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm with provable performance bounds for the generalized problem. We show that the running time of our algorithm is in the order of O(mn\u03b1(m, n)), where m is the number of edges, n is the number of sensors, and \u03b1 is the inverse Ackerman function. Though our work is motivated by applications in sensor networks, the proposed algorithm is general enough to handle a wide range of degree-oriented spanning tree problems, including bounded degree spanning tree problem and minimum degree spanning tree problem. When applied to these problems, it incurs a lower computational cost in comparison to existing methods.

The new dualized model differs from the primal formulation in its dimension and uses a different description of the uncertainty set. We show that the optimal primal affine policy can be directly obtained from the optimal affine policy in the dual formulation. We provide empirical evidence that the dualized model in the context of two-stage lot-sizing on a network and two-stage facility location problems solves an order of magnitude faster than the primal formulation with affine policies. We also provide an explanation and associated empirical evidence that offer insight on which characteristics of the dualized formulation make computations faster.

This type of problem finds application in, for example, inventory management, lot sizing, and manpower management. We show that by iteratively splitting the uncertainty set into subsets, one can differentiate the later-period decisions based on the revealed uncertain parameters. At the same time, the problem\u2019s computational complexity stays at the same level, as for the static robust problem. This also holds in the nonfixed recourse situation. In the fixed recourse situation our approach can be combined with linear decision rules for the continuous decision variables.

To maximize a total reward function, the decision maker decides not only about item knapsack assignments, but also the specific location of items within their assigned knapsacks and their total space allocation within prespecified lower and upper bounds. Mathematical programming formulations are developed for single and multiple knapsack variants of this problem along with valid inequalities, preprocessing routines, and model enhancements.

Given the nonconvex nature of gas transmission constraints, global optimality and infeasibility guarantees can only be offered by global optimisation approaches. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art global optimisation solvers are unable to scale up to real-world size instances. In this study, we present a convex mixed-integer second-order cone relaxation for the gas expansion planning problem under steady-state conditions. The underlying model offers tight lower bounds with high computational efficiency. In addition, the optimal solution of the relaxation can often be used to derive high-quality solutions to the original problem, leading to provably tight optimality gaps and, in some cases, global optimal solutions. The convex relaxation is based on a few key ideas, including the introduction of flux direction variables, exact McCormick relaxations, on/off constraints, and integer cuts. Numerical experiments are conducted on the traditional Belgian gas network, as well as other real larger networks. The results demonstrate both the accuracy and computational speed of the relaxation and its ability to produce high-quality solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0697","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of gas expansion planning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We propose a methodology that can approximate the convex hulls of all such possible relaxations by generating violated valid inequalities. To generate such inequalities, we separate two-period projections of fractional linear programming solutions from the convex hulls of the two-period closure we study. The convex hull representation of the two-period closure is generated dynamically using column generation. Contrary to regular column generation, our method is an outer approximation and can therefore be used efficiently in a regular branch-and-bound procedure. We present computational results that illustrate how these two-period models could be effective in solving complicated problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0712","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methodologies for solving big-bucket lot-sizing problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of 'woke' themes."],["2016","28","4","","Appreciation to Reviewers","On behalf of the Editorial Board, I would like to thank the following people, who acted as Reviewers during the past year.

In an attempt to improve their performance along these dimensions, hospitals are making significant investments in health information technologies (HIT). However, the performance benefits from these investments are largely unknown. This study employs a portfolio approach to study HIT adoption using a large longitudinal panel data for 3615 US hospitals from 2007 to 2012. Insights from the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) and existing HIT literature are used to categorize 76 HITs into 3 distinct bundles based on their extent of patient centered integration, and the extent of caregiver interaction. We then examine how two key HIT bundles: Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for patient data collection, diagnosis and treatment) and Augmented Clinical HIT (defined as HIT systems primarily used for integrating patient information and augmenting decision making capability of caregivers) jointly impact cost and process quality outcomes. Cost is measured in terms of total hospital operating expenses per bed while process quality is assessed along two dimensions: conformance quality or the ability to adhere to technical standards and experiential quality or the ability to cater to preferences of the patient. Results suggest complementarities between Clinical and Augmented Clinical HIT with respect to process quality but not cost outcomes. A follow-up post-hoc analysis which divides Augmented Clinical HIT into Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Non-EMR technologies offers additional explanation to the lack of association with cost. We discuss these implications to both theory and practice of HIT adoption.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.10.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['patient centered', 'caregiver interaction', 'preferences']","The article touches on patient-centered integration and caregiver interactions, which indicate a focus on improving healthcare outcomes for patients.

We describe this new responsibility as the double agency role. We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first-tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in-depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second-tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first-tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first-tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple-bottom-line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi-tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.001","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['sustainability', 'social', 'triple-bottom-line', 'agency', 'compliance']","The article discusses sustainability compliance and the social dimension of the triple-bottom-line, indicating a moderate emphasis on ethical business practices and social responsibility.

Based on the seminal RBV articles, we argue that using the RBV does not align with the objectives and activities of operations management researchers in several ways. First, the dependent variable in the RBV is sustained competitive advantage. Using sustained competitive advantage as a dependent variable implies that scholars focus on explaining the differences between the relatively few firms with sustained competitive advantage and all the other firms, ignoring performance variations within the great mass of firms. In addition, competitive advantage exists at the level of the business or the firm and does not directly translate into the normal level of operations management research. Measuring sustained competitive advantage also presents difficulties. Second, the explanatory variables in the RBV are resources that must be rare, valuable and hard or impossible to imitate. Measuring valuable resources or factors firms cannot imitate poses serious problems both in demonstrating value independent of the factor's impact on performance (i.e., avoiding tautology) and in measuring unique or nearly unique entities. Third, under the RBV, prescription is problematic; you cannot prescribe things that firms can readily implement because such things can be imitated. We present the practice-based view (PBV) as a simpler and better alternative for operations management where scholars attempt to explain the entire range of firm and unit performance based on transferable practices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.003","forum","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the resource-based view (RBV) and its limitations in operations management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We focus on understanding the evolutionary path of LEED consulting work as a result of its knowledge base, community and response to market and technological forces. Case evidence demonstrates an inherent tension between innovation and commodification resulting from multiple demands through various developmental stages. The life cycle model has important implications for value-creation in professional service operations management. First, it broadens the theoretical investigation of professional services to consider all processes and people along the professional continuum \u2013 from most innovative to commodified. Coordinated effort along the professional continuum is the key to delivering both effectiveness and efficiency. Second, proactively managing the transitions along the evolutionary path is both possible and desirable. Standardization and specialization improve talent allocation and boost future innovation.

A distinctive operational feature of this setting is that the delivery of health care services requires continuous collaboration between two professional workforces: physicians and nurses. We conducted a multiple-case study at five acute care U.S. hospitals, which involved 49 semi-structured interviews, to uncover the organizational mechanisms that facilitate effective collaboration between physicians and nurses. Our analyses suggest that they experience distinct challenges that prevented collaboration during health care delivery. Specifically, physicians typically favored evidence-based standards of care which can sometimes undermine patient interactions. We refer to this preference as a disease-focus challenge. We also found that nurses were often hesitant to speak-up during their interactions with the physicians, which constitute a hierarchical challenge. Commonly prescribed mechanisms, such as multi-disciplinary rounding, were not effective in overcoming these challenges. Our analyses revealed new forms of collaboration between different levels of the physician and nursing entities, which we denote as \u201cnursing-led cross-level collaboration\u201d and \u201cphysician-led cross-level collaboration\u201d. Our study suggests that nursing-led cross-level collaboration helped mitigate the disease-focus challenge experienced by physicians while physician-led cross-level collaboration helped mitigate the hierarchical challenge experienced by nurses. It also offers preliminary insights on how PSF in general can develop and sustain such collaboration.

We analyse mixed-method data (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a best\u2013worst choice experimental survey) and observe that consultancy can actually be quite remote and passive and that any periods of face-to-face \u2018engagement\u2019 will typically be time limited and focused on specific project phases. Moreover, and further confirming the value of a study that allowed us to investigate professional service operations in a specific market context, our data suggest this may often be at the behest of the client. The significant variation observed in levels of customization we interpret as confirming Maister's (1993) notion of a portfolio of brains, grey hair, and procedural work. We also observed relatively high levels of capital intensity; reflecting perhaps the vintage of most OM characterizations and the dramatic ICT-related changes that have occurred in all business operations in the last 20 years. The work also demonstrates the necessity of a more contingent perspective on PSOM. We assess the impact of both firm (scale, specialization) and individual level (leverage) characteristics to demonstrate significant variation within what might be expected to be a relatively homogenous group of professional service operations. For example, investigating the effects of specialization (via a typology of consulting operations: super-specialists, generalists, deep knowledge traders, deep market knowledge traders) revealed that relative degree of interaction may be dependent upon degree of expertise, such that it was the super-specialists in our sample that spent less time with clients and the more generalist firms who were complementing their limited expert status with high levels of interaction (networking, etc.).","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['managerial challenges', 'professional services', 'customer engagement']","The article primarily focuses on operational characteristics and managerial challenges within the consultancy sector without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

To optimize the use of their fleets, humanitarian organizations recommend policies aimed at enhancing the utilization of vehicles while preserving residual value. Although these decisions have a significant impact on cost, there is limited empirical evidence to show that the recommended policies are actually implemented and that they produce the expected benefits. This paper theoretically and empirically examines the complex and inter-related effects of vehicle-to-mission allocation decisions and of alternative vehicle usage patterns on vehicle utilization and residual value in humanitarian development programs. The results suggest that humanitarian organizations could break the utilization\u2013residual value trade-off by adopting different policies than the ones currently in place. They also reveal that organizations need to realize that what seems logical from the headquarters' perspective may be illogical or inconvenient for the field, and as a result, the field may do the opposite of what is recommended or even instructed. Therefore, they either need better data and analysis combined with audits or they need to improve mechanisms that incentivize field delegations to follow standards recommended by the headquarters.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.03.008","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'development', 'impact', 'organizations']","The article discusses the implications of fleet management in humanitarian organizations, which suggests a focus on social impact and ethical considerations in operations management.

In this paper, we present a new, two-level oblique linear discriminant tree model, which identifies the optimal hierarchical forecast technique for a given hierarchical database in a very time-efficient manner. We induced our model from a real-world dataset, and it separates all historical time series into the four aggregation mechanisms considered. The separation process is a function of both the positive and negative correlation groups' variances at the lowest level of the hierarchical datasets. Our primary contributions are: (1) establishing a clear-cut relationship between the correlation metrics at the lowest level of the hierarchy and the optimal aggregation mechanism for a product/service hierarchy, and (2) developing an analytical model for personalized forecast aggregation decisions, based on characteristics of a hierarchical dataset.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.04.001","short communication","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of forecasting models without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2016","44","1","E.

Drawing on contingency theory, we analyze firm-level antecedents and consequences associated with CSCOs being appointed to top management teams (TMTs). We conceptually develop the role of CSCOs and hypothesize that CSCOs are most likely to be appointed to TMTs at firms where supply chain-related integration and differentiation pressures are high. The results from a matched sample of S&P 1500 firms over a 21-year period reveal that financial leverage, internationalization, and diversification all predict CSCO appointment to the TMT. Our results also suggest that these same contingencies positively moderate the effect of CSCO presence on firm performance, with CSCOs proving beneficial when leverage, internationalization, and diversification levels are high, but detrimental when leverage, internationalization, and diversification are low. In addition, we find post-hoc evidence that suggests institutional forces may also be a factor in CSCO appointments. Our results reveal that most of the contingency performance effects manifest only for early adopters of the CSCO role, suggesting that late-mover elevation of the supply chain function to the TMT is a form of mimetic isomorphism. This study extends research on CSCOs and their emergence in TMTs, as well as the role of operations management in corporate strategy.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supply chain', 'management', 'consequences']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of supply chain management and the appointment of Chief Supply Chain Officers without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

These government or non-government organizations dynamically make stockpile decisions independently. Even though the value of one organization's stock deployment is contingent on others' decisions, decision makers lack evidence regarding sector capacity to assess the marginal contribution (positive or negative) of their action. To our knowledge, there exist no metrics describing the system capacity across many agents to respond to disasters. To address this gap, our analytical approach yields new humanitarian logistics metrics based on stochastic optimization models. Our study incorporates empirical data on inventory stored by various organizations in United Nations facilities and in their own warehouses to offer practical insights regarding the current humanitarian response capabilities and strategies.

In this paper, we consider inventory allocation issues faced by a retailer during a hurricane event and provide insights that can be applied to humanitarian operations during slow-onset events. We start with an empirical analysis using regression that triangulates three sources of information: a large point-of-sales data set from a Texas Gulf Coast retailer, the retailer's operational and logistical constraints, and hurricane forecast data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). We establish a strong association between the timing of the hurricane weather forecast, the forecasted landfall position of the storm, and hurricane sales. Storm intensity is found to have a weaker association on overall inventory decisions. Using the results of the empirical analysis and the NHC forecast data, we construct a state-space model of demand during the threat of a hurricane and develop an inventory management model to satisfy consumer demand prior to a hurricane making landfall. Based on the structure of the problem, we model this situation as a two-stage, two-location inventory allocation model from a centralized distribution center that balances transportation, shortage and holding costs. The model is used to explore the role of recourse, i.e., deferring part of the inventory allocation until observing the state of the hurricane as it moves towards landfall. Our approach provides valuable insights into the circumstances under which recourse may or may not be worthwhile in any setting where an anticipated extreme event drives consumer demand.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.006","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['humanitarian', 'consumer demand', 'natural disaster']","The article focuses on inventory management during natural disasters, which touches on humanitarian operations but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

As a means of gathering and sharing information, humanitarian organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on social media platforms based on the Internet. In this paper, we present a field study that examines how effectively information diffuses through social media networks embedded in these platforms. Using a large dataset from Twitter during Hurricane Sandy, we first applied Information Diffusion Theory to characterize diffusion rates. Then, we empirically examined the impact of key elements on information propagation rates on social media. Our results revealed that internal diffusion through social media networks advances at a significantly higher speed than information in these networks coming from external sources. This finding is important because it suggests that social media networks are effective at passing information along during humanitarian crises that require urgent information diffusion. Our results also indicate that dissemination rates depend on the influence of those who originate the information. Moreover, they suggest that information posted earlier during a disaster exhibits a significantly higher speed of diffusion than information that is introduced later during more eventful stages in the disaster. This is because, over time, participation in the diffusion of information declines as more and more communications compete for attention among users.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.007","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'crises', 'information diffusion']","The article discusses the role of social media in disseminating information during humanitarian crises, which aligns with themes of social responsibility and ethical considerations in operations management.

This paper hypothesizes that population vulnerability of a country transforms exogenous hazards to disaster impact for that country, which negatively impacts its economy as measured by per capita income and its growth. This impact in turn increases the vulnerability of the country's population thus creating a reinforcing loop. Therefore, like the output of any positive feedback loop, disaster impact would grow exponentially.

The panel data set (2007\u20132011) used in this study includes information at the hospital level for 163 hospitals and qualitative data collected from interviews with medical staff from the Colombian Ministry of Health and hospitals in different conflict zones. Our results indicate that armed conflict has a positive effect on total factor productivity, while it has a negative impact on hospital efficiency, and interestingly that efficiency and total factor productivity both increase in post conflict. Finally, the results show that efficiency variability is higher in peace and post-conflict hospitals and lower in medium and severe-conflict hospitals.

The study finds a positive and significant association between outsourcing to emerging markets and recalls and that sales penetration into emerging markets reduces recalls; however, it finds no direct relationship between in-house offshoring and recalls. Interestingly, in-house offshoring to emerging markets appears to mitigate the positive relationship between outsourcing to these markets and recalls; this suggests that transactional complexities of outsourcing to emerging markets are mitigated by a physical presence in the market. This important finding suggests that by keeping some operations in-house, firms may reduce the negative effect of outsourcing on product quality and safety while reaping low-cost benefits of sourcing from these emerging markets. Additionally, the results indicate that institutional immaturities within recipient countries (associated with outsourcing) are primary contributors to inefficiencies affecting quality performance. On the inventory side, sourcing from emerging markets negatively affects inventory performance.

Specifically, we identify two institutional factors that may give rise to contract ineffectiveness, information transparency and legal enforceability, as they determine how effectively a firm designs and enforces a contract. In addition, we reveal that contract ineffectiveness prompts a firm to seek social ties, including business ties and political ties, to overcome the institutionally induced limits of contracts. These efforts, however, are moderated by the type of predominant pressure a firm bears. While equity pressure strengthens the relationship between contract ineffectiveness and a firm's pursuit of social ties, efficiency pressure weakens this relationship, because seeking social ties imposes an extra burden of efficiency. Tested by data collected from 187 distributors in China, our study reveals the institutional causes and the consequences of contract ineffectiveness, which is a common problem encountered by firms when forming supply chain partnerships in emerging markets.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.07.004","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['institutional environment', 'social ties', 'equity pressure']","The article discusses the impact of institutional factors on contract effectiveness and mentions social ties, which suggests a consideration of relational dynamics in business.

Our findings show that, in the absence of intense stakeholder pressure, buyers can lay the foundation for improved social performance by using their own auditors and collaborating with suppliers rather than using third-party auditors. However, in the face of acute attention from customers, NGOs and media, we observed that consultative buyer-consortium audits emerged, and shared third-party audits offered other advantages such as increased transparency and improvements in worker education and training.

To provide clarification on the inappropriateness of PLS for applied research, we provide a non-technical review and empirical demonstration of its inherent, intractable problems. We show that although the PLS technique is promoted as a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, it is simply regression with scale scores and thus has very limited capabilities to handle the wide array of problems for which applied researchers use SEM. To that end, we explain why the use of PLS weights and many rules of thumb that are commonly employed with PLS are unjustifiable, followed by addressing why the touted advantages of the method are simply untenable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical shortcomings of a specific modeling technique without addressing any social, ethical, or progressive themes.

An openness to assistance can lead to the timely delivery of aid whereas a reluctance to receive assistance can have devastating consequences.

In this paper, we present an in-depth multiple-case study that explores this aspect. Results show that host government actions are explained by their dependency on IHOs and the levels of tensions between their interests (i.e., conflicting strategic goals). In addition, a host government's regulatory and enforcement capabilities are important for ensuring that they can safeguard their interests. We derive four stances that host governments can adopt in regulating logistics-related activities: non-restrictive, opportunistic, selectively accommodating and uncompromising. Each of these has different implications for the logistics performance of IHOs.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.011","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'aid', 'interests', 'logistics']","The article discusses the impact of host governments on humanitarian aid logistics, highlighting the importance of timely assistance and the implications of government actions on relief operations.

Choosing appropriate locations is not easy and frequently based on opportunities rather than rational decisions. Dedicated decision-support systems could help humanitarian practitioners design their supply networks. Academic literature suggests the use of commercial sector models but rarely considers the constraints and specific context of humanitarian operations, such as obtaining accurate data, high uncertainties, limited budgets and increasing pressure on cost efficiency. We propose a tooled methodology to properly support humanitarian decision makers in the design of their supply chains. Our contribution is based on the definition of aggregate scenarios to reliably forecast demand using past disaster data and future trends. Demand for relief items based on these scenarios is then fed to a mixed-integer linear programming model in order to improve current supply networks. The specifications of this model have been defined in close collaboration with humanitarian workers. The model allows analysis of the impact of alternative sourcing strategies and service level requirements on operational efficiency. It provides clear and actionable recommendations for a given context, bridging the gap between academics and humanitarian logisticians. The methodology was developed to be useful to a broad range of humanitarian organizations, and a specific application to the supply chain design of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is discussed in detail.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.012","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'supply chain', 'efficiency', 'decision-support', 'collaboration']","The article discusses humanitarian logistics and the importance of designing supply chains that effectively respond to crises, indicating a moderate focus on social impact and ethical considerations in operations management.

Healthcare reimbursement entails coding, billing, and payment processes based on care provided to patients. As this research note highlights, though often implicitly assumed to be independent of care delivery processes, reimbursement processes are distinctly connected to the efficacy of care delivery. Prior research tends to examine neither antecedents nor consequences of healthcare reimbursement processes and their operational implications, even though these issues can lead to unproductive externalities affecting healthcare systems and patients. Most extant literature tends to focus on medical task environments, with far less attention given to how institutional environment structures reimbursement and thus drives stakeholder incentives and behaviors. Because of a wide diversity of institutional environments, reimbursement processes differ on a nation-by-nation basis, and within nations on a state, province, city, or even within-city basis. The varied and complex reimbursement processes drive divergent stakeholder incentives, varying use of healthcare protocols and processes, and differing patient outcomes. Even within a single reimbursement regime, a multitude of reimbursement policies, required processes, and payer institutions creates operational complexity for physicians and their professional staff, which ultimately affects patient care delivery processes and outcomes. The task environment focus of extant healthcare OM research suggests a need to understand institutional environment antecedents, natures, and impacts of reimbursement processes. This research note illustrates the seemingly simple structural nature of reimbursement processes, yet\u00a0also reminds researchers how diverse institutional environments, built to accomplish different healthcare aims, can lead to similar levels of enormous process complexity. The research note further motivates how such phenomena may affect research findings and the quest for operational solutions to healthcare dilemmas. By focusing on healthcare reimbursement and its operational implications, the note provides useful insights for continued studies of healthcare operations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2016.09.001","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['institutional environment', 'healthcare', 'stakeholder incentives', 'patient outcomes']","The article discusses the impact of institutional environments on healthcare reimbursement processes and stakeholder incentives, which touches on themes of equity and patient outcomes.

Yet, there is a paucity of studies that investigates how such failures manifest on e-commerce websites and their impact on consumers.  This paper, therefore, synthesizes extant literature on e-service and system success to arrive at a novel classification system that delineates e-commerce service failures into information, functional, and system categories, each with its own set of constituent dimensions.  Extending expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT), we further distinguish among disconfirmed outcome, process, and cost expectancies as major consequences of e-commerce service failures.  A theoretical model of e-commerce service failure classifications and their consequences was constructed together with testable propositions that relate the three failure categories to consumers\u2019 disconfirmed expectancies.  Finally, we explore the validity of our theoretical model based on descriptive accounts of actual occurrences of e-commerce service failures and their corresponding consequences.  Consistent with our theoretical model, information and functional failures were found to be associated with disconfirmed outcome and process expectancies respectively.  System failures, on the other hand, do not affect consumers\u2019 disconfirmed expectancies, thereby contradicting our predictions.  Post hoc analysis on constituent dimensions of information, functional, and system failures yielded additional insights on the preceding observations.\n\n10/14/15","https://misq.umn.edu/an-exploratory-study-of-the-formation-and-impact-of-electronic-service-failures.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of e-commerce service failures without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2016","40.0","1","Srinivasan Raghunathan and Sumit Sarkar","Competitive Bundling in Information Markets:  A Seller-Side Analysis","The emerging field of data analytics and the increasing importance of data and information in decision making has created a large market for buying and selling information and information-related services.  In this market, for some types of information products, it is common for a consumer to purchase the same type of information product from multiple sources.  In other situations, a consumer may buy different types of information products from different sources and synthesize the information.  On the seller side, bundling of different types of information products appears to have emerged as a key design strategy to improve profitability.  This paper examines bundling decisions of a duopoly in the information market in which each seller offers two (or more) types of information products.  A pair of competing information products from the two sellers can be substitutes or complements and consumers may find it profitable to purchase the same type of information from both sellers.  We show that bundling by both sellers emerges as the equilibrium outcome when (at least) one competing pair consists of substitutes and (at least) one pair consists of complements.  In this case, bundling by both sellers benefits them both by softening the price competition between their offerings.  Softening of competition does not occur when all competing pairs in the bundles have only substitutes (complements) even if the degree of substitutability (complementarity) between products within a pair varies across pairs, resulting in an equilibrium in which each information type is sold separately by both sellers.\n\n12/07/15","https://misq.umn.edu/competitive-bundling-in-information-markets-a-seller-side-analysis.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information bundling and profitability without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

It focuses on two understudied themes in the IT outsourcing literature.  First, while the literature is predominantly concerned with opportunism and consequent ex post hazard costs that contracts can safeguard against, parties to a contract also economize on ex ante transaction costs by their choice of contract type and contract extensiveness.  Second, the literature studies the aggregate extensiveness of contracts rather than of distinct contract functions:  safeguarding, coordination, and adaptability.  Against this backdrop, our research model portrays a nuanced picture that is anchored in the following theoretical interpretation:  transaction and relational attributes have implications on specific ex ante and ex post transaction costs, and these implications can be balanced by respective choices in both contract type and the extensiveness of specific contract functions.  These two contract design choices complement and substitute for each other in their ability to economize on specific transaction costs.  Our analysis of 210 software development outsourcing contracts finds that explanatory power increases when analyzing the extensiveness of individual contract functions rather than the aggregate contract extensiveness, highlighting subtle competing influences that are otherwise masked by an aggregate measure.  Our analysis also shows that a preference for time-and-material contracts counteracts the effect of certain transaction attributes on contract extensiveness, and even cancels it out in the case of transaction uncertainty.\n\n10/22/2015","https://misq.umn.edu/contract-design-choices-and-the-balance-of-ex-ante-and-ex-post-transaction-costs-in-software-development-outsourcing.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of contract design and transaction costs in software development outsourcing, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We also explore the moderating effect of product type (search or experience goods) on the relationship between keyword characteristics and consumer search behaviors and how high-demand seasons (e.g., scheduled sales) influence consumers\u2019 search and purchase behaviors.  In addition, we estimate the effectiveness of keywords on the basis of their sales-per-cost performance.  The findings indicate that search queries containing deal-seeking keywords are associated with higher click-through rates and conversion rates than are search queries without such keywords.  We also find that the positive effect of deal-seeking keywords on click-through rates is more pronounced for experience goods than for search goods.  However, we identify a negative interaction between experience goods and brand-seeking keywords.

Using The New York Times\u2019 paywall rollout as a natural experiment, our study examines how the implementation of paywall by a firm (i.e., a shift from \u201cfree\u201d to \u201cfor-a-fee\u201d) influences the pattern and effectiveness of online WOM in social media.  Our results indicate that implementing a paywall (i.e., charging for content that was earlier available for free) has a disproportionate impact on WOM for popular and niche articles, creating a longer tail in the WOM (i.e., content sharing) distribution.  Further, we find that the impact of WOM on the NYT\u2019s website traffic weakens significantly after the introduction of a paywall.

We view IT strategy as an expression of the dominant strategic objective that the firm chooses to emphasize, which can be revenue expansion, cost reduction, or a dual emphasis in which both goals are pursued.  Using data from more than 300 firms in the United States, we find that at the mean value of IT investments, firms with a dual IT strategic emphasis have a higher market value as measured by Tobin\u2019s Q than firms with a revenue or a cost emphasis, but they have similar levels of profitability.  Of greater importance, IT strategic emphasis plays a significant role in moderating the relationship between IT investments and firm performance.

We build on and extend MIS research on process digitization and digital versus traditional communication media to study how and to what extent social media\u2014one form of digital mass media\u2014are emancipatory (i.e., permitting wide-spread participation in public discourse and surfacing of diverse perspectives) versus hegemonic (i.e., contributing to ideological control by a few).  While a pressing concern to activists and scholars, systematic study of this issue has been elusive, owing partially to the complexity of the emancipation and hegemony concepts.  Using a case study approach, we iteratively engaged with data on the discourse surrounding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and source literature to identify six facets of interpretive media packages (i.e., competing social constructions of an issue) as measurable constructs pertinent to emancipation and hegemony.  These facets included three structural constraints (on authorship, citation, and influence) and three content restrictions (on frames, signatures, and emotion).  We investigated propositions regarding effects of social versus traditional media and lean versus rich social media on these interpretive media package facets by comparing the SOPA discourse across two lean traditional and social media (newspapers and Twitter) and two rich traditional and social media (television and YouTube).  Our findings paradoxically revealed social media to be emancipatory with regard to structural constraints, but hegemonic with regard to an important content restriction (i.e., frames).  Lean social media mitigated structural advantages and exacerbated content problems.  These findings suggest that, as with traditional media, some inevitable evils accompany the societal benefits of social media and that mass media is having a detrimental effect on public discourse.  We offer practical steps by which private and public institutions may counter this effect, theoretical implications for wider consideration of the six interpretive media package facets proposed here, and encouragement to MIS researchers to increase their efforts to compare different digitized processes so that a more comprehensive theory of the effects of different forms of digitized processes can be developed.\n\n12/09/15","https://misq.umn.edu/are-social-media-emancipatory-or-hegemonic-societal-effects-of-mass-media-digitization-in-the-case-of-the-sopa-discourse.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","8","['emancipatory', 'hegemonic', 'diverse perspectives', 'public discourse', 'ideological control']","The article discusses the dual nature of social media as both emancipatory and hegemonic, emphasizing the importance of diverse perspectives and public discourse, which aligns with social justice themes.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors.  We examine how the use of one ICT intervention\u2014specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information\u2014can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India.  We investigate how mothers\u2019 social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality.  Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers\u2019 health-related behaviors for the care of their infants.  Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use.  The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care.  In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower.  Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society\u2019s most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.  Overall, we believe such an ICT intervention will complement other investments being made, including the facilitation of use (proxy use) and provision of professional medical facilities to reduce infant mortality.\n\n3/24/16","https://misq.umn.edu/combating-infant-mortality-in-rural-india-evidence-from-a-field-study-of-ehealth-kiosk-imlementations.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","8","['infant mortality', 'healthcare', 'social networks', 'ICT intervention', 'social influence']","The article addresses a significant social issue\u2014infant mortality\u2014through the lens of technology and social networks, emphasizing the societal impact of healthcare interventions in rural areas.

Extending research on the role of ICT in the productivity of nations, we posit that the effects of ICT may not be limited to productivity (e.g., GDP), and we argue that the use of ICT can also improve the well-being of a country by helping citizens to develop their social capital and achieve social equality, enabling access to health-related information and health services, providing education to disadvantaged communities, and facilitating commerce. Using a number of empirical specifications, specifically a fixed-effects model and an instrumental variable approach, our results show that the level of ICT use (number of fixed telephones, Internet, mobile phones) in a country predict a country\u2019s well-being (despite accounting for GDP and several other control variables that also predict a country\u2019s well-being). Furthermore, by using an exploratory method (biclustering) of identifying both country-specific and ICT-specific variables simultaneously, we identify clusters of countries with similar patterns in terms of their use of ICT, and we show that not all countries increase their level of well-being by using ICT in the same manner.  Interestingly, we find that less developed countries increase their level of well-being with mobile phones primarily, while more developed countries increase their level of well-being with any ICT system.

We call the resulting mix of appropriations across multiple elements by multiple actors in multiple settings multiplex appropriation.  Complex societal challenges often involve multiple users in multiple settings with varied needs and few technology skills; thus, designing systems to meet user requirements may prove impossible.

Specifically, we theorize the relationship between e-government and corruption at two levels:  (1) base corruption observed in national institutions (political, legal, and media institutions), and (2) permeated corruption in the national stakeholder service systems (business and citizen systems).  Using panel data from 63 countries over a 4-year period, we test the direct and mediated effects of e-government on corruption in national institutions and stakeholder service systems, respectively.  This exploratory study provides preliminary insights into the mechanisms through which corruption manifests in a nation and demonstrates how e-government can be helpful in alleviating it.  In addition, the study offers important implications that we believe will be instrumental in stimulating future research on the subject.\n\n10/14/15","https://misq.umn.edu/you-can-t-bribe-a-computer-dealing-with-the-societal-challenge-of-corruption-through-ict.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","7","['transparency', 'fairness', 'corruption', 'e-government']","The article addresses the societal challenge of corruption and emphasizes the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in enhancing transparency and fairness, which are key themes in social justice and ethical governance.

Discordant naming of constructs is here termed the construct identity fallacy (CIF).  We designed and evaluated the construct identity detector (CID), the first tool with large-scale construct identity detection properties and the first tool that does not require respondent data.  Through the adaptation and combination of different natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, six designs were created and evaluated against human expert decisions.  All six designs were found capable of detecting construct identity, and a design combining two existing algorithms significantly outperformed the other approaches.  A set of follow-up studies suggests the tool is valuable as a supplement to expert efforts in literature review and meta-analysis.  Beyond design science contributions, this article has important implications related to the taxonomic structure of social and behavioral science constructs, for the jingle and jangle fallacy, the core of the Information Systems nomological network, and the inaccessibility of social and behavioral science knowledge.

This paper studies how the chosen revenue model affects the revenue of a platform, buyers\u2019 payoffs, sellers\u2019 payoffs, and social welfare.  We find that when little space can be dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, the brokerage model generates more revenue for the platform than the advertising model.  When a significant proportion of space is dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, matching probability on a platform plays a critical role in determining which revenue model can generate more revenue:  If the matching probability is high, the brokerage model generates more revenue; otherwise, the advertising model generates more revenue.  Buyers are always better off under the advertising model because of larger participation by the sellers in the platform\u2019s free service.  Sellers are better off under the advertising model in most scenarios.  The only exception is when the matching probability is low and the platform dedicates considerable space to advertising.  Under these conditions, the sellers with payoffs similar to the marginal advertiser who is indifferent about advertising can be worse off under the advertising model.

There is an important theoretical and practical impetus for this research, since the nature of IS projects creates specific and challenging conditions for control, and since control research in neighboring disciplines often neglects temporary endeavors such as projects.\n\n\t\tIn this study, we provide a systematic review and synthesis of the literature and develop an expanded theoretical framework for IS project control with supporting conjectures.  Our review reveals that existing research primarily studies the contextual antecedents and performance consequences of control modes and amounts, and thus focuses on control portfolio configurations (what).  In contrast, prior research largely neglects control enactment, that is, how the controller interacts with the controllee to put the portfolio of controls into practice.  Our expanded framework points to the importance of studying control portfolio configurations and control enactment (in terms of control style and control congruence) in combination, in order to better understand IS project control effectiveness.

Under the two-call design, in addition to the call to all bidders at the beginning of the auction, the exchange calls out the winning bidder at the end of the auction; this second call enables the winning bidder to match the right advertiser for the impression.  Thus, the two-call design requires a higher level of technical sophistication but offers to the auction site the choice of the timing and the extent of information released to bidders about an impression.\n\n\t\tWhile valuations are private to bidders, there are two possibilities as far as the information available to the ad exchange on these bidder valuations is concerned:  One, the ad exchange has no reliable knowledge about bidder valuations.  For this situation, we develop simple information revelation policies that do not use any knowledge of the valuations and establish their performance guarantees.  Two, the ad exchange has distributional knowledge about bidder valuations.  For this situation, we develop an informed heuristic that exploits this information.  While the heuristic continues to offer the same performance guarantee as that of the simple policies, we show that its performance on a comprehensive test bed is near-optimal.

In contrast to traditional propensity score (PS) matching methods, including those using classification trees as a subcomponent, our tree-based approach provides a standalone, automated, data-driven methodology that allows for (1) the examination of nascent interventions whose selection is difficult and costly to theoretically specify a priori, (2) detection of heterogeneous intervention effects for different pre-intervention profiles, (3) identification of pre-intervention variables that correlate with the self-selected intervention, and (4) visual presentation of intervention effects that is easy to discern and understand.  As such, the tree-based approach is a useful tool for analyzing observational impact studies as well as for post-analysis of experimental data.  The tree-based approach is particularly advantageous in the analyses of big data, or data with large sample sizes and a large number of variables.  It outperforms PS in terms of computational time, data loss, and automatic capture of nonlinear relationships and heterogeneous interventions.  It also requires less user specification and choices than PS, reducing potential data dredging.

For instance, they can warn decision makers about undesirable events that are likely to happen in the future, giving the decision maker an opportunity to intervene.  The topic is gaining momentum in process mining, a field of research that has traditionally developed tools to discover business process models from data sets of past process behavior.  Predictive modeling techniques are built on top of process-discovery algorithms.  As these algorithms describe business process behavior using models of formal languages (e.g., Petri nets), strong language biases are necessary in order to generate models with the limited amounts of data included in the data set.  Naturally, corresponding predictive modeling techniques reflect these biases.  Based on theory from grammatical inference, a field of research that is concerned with inducing language models, we design a new predictive modeling technique based on weaker biases.

We present scalable approaches to address privacy concerns when sharing transactional databases.  Although the benefits of sharing are well documented and the number of firms sharing transactional data has increased over the years, the rate at which this number has grown is not quite what it could have been. Concerns about revealing proprietary information have prevented some retailers from sharing, despite the obvious advantages in an increasingly networked economy.  In the context of sharing transactional data, sensitive information is typically based on relationships derived from frequently occurring itemsets, result of surprisingly successful promotions by the retailer, or unexpected relationships identified by the retailer while mining the data.  Prior work in this area includes optimal approaches based on integer programming to maximize the accuracy of shared databases, while hiding all sensitive itemsets.  While these approaches were shown to solve problems involving up to 10 million transactions, many transactional databases in the big data context are considerably larger and the existing integer programming-based procedures do not scale well enough to solve these larger problems.  Consequently, there is no effective solution procedure for such databases in extant literature.\n\n\t\tIn this paper, we first present an optimal procedure leveraging intuition from linear programming based column generation.  Next, we identify a common structure that exists in these problems, and show how it can be taken advantage of through an approach based on sorting and column generation to make the process more efficient.  We then illustrate how this structure can be incorporated into the column generation based procedure to develop an effective, scalable heuristic.  Computational experiments are conducted on databases with 50 million and 100 million transactions, involving problems that could not be solved using existing optimal procedures.  These experiments show that the optimal column generation based procedure can solve problem instances significantly larger than those tackled previously, and that the scalable heuristic identifies near-optimal solutions quickly in all instances where the optimal solution is known.  We investigate the impact of hiding sensitive itemsets on the quality of a rule-based recommender system derived from the shared data.  As expected, recommendation quality decreases as the number of sensitive itemsets increases; however, recommendation accuracy stays above 80% of the original rate when using the unmodified data even when there are 1,000 sensitive itemsets to hide.  The effect on recommendation accuracy from using the heuristic relative to the optimal approach was very small:  the accuracies with the heuristic were over 97% of the corresponding accuracies with the optimal approach in every experiment, and over 99% in the vast majority.\n\n06/01/16","https://misq.umn.edu/privacy-and-big-data-scalable-approaches-to-sanitize-large-transactional-databases-for-sharing.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['privacy', 'sensitive information', 'sharing', 'transactional databases']","The article discusses privacy concerns related to big data sharing, which touches on ethical considerations but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or advocacy for marginalized groups.

Using a massive individual-level data set, our paper captures the effectiveness of display advertising across a wide range of consumer behaviors.  Two unique features of our data set that distinguish this paper from prior work are (1) the information on the actual viewability of impressions as on average 55% of the display ads are not rendered viewable and (2) the duration of exposure to the display advertisements, both at the individual-user level.  Employing a quasi-experiment enabled by our setting, we use difference-in-differences and corresponding matching methods as well as instrumental variable techniques to control for unobservable and observable confounders.  We empirically demonstrate that mere exposure to display advertising increases users\u2019 propensity to search for the brand and the corresponding product; consumers engage both in active search exerting effort to gather information, and in passive search using information sources that arrive exogenously.  We also find statistically and economically significant effects of display advertising on increasing consumers\u2019 propensity to make a purchase.  Furthermore, our findings reveal that the longer the duration of exposure to display advertising, the more likely the consumers are to engage in direct search behaviors (e.g., direct visits) rather than indirect ones (e.g., search engine inquiries).  We also study the effects of various types of display advertising (e.g., prospecting, retargeting, affiliate targeting, video advertising, etc.) and the different goals they achieve.

Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions.  We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer\u2013brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications.  The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making.  We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework.  The results provide strong support for our proposed framework.  Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments.  Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework.  To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance.\n\n3/4/16","https://misq.umn.edu/using-big-data-to-model-time-varying-effects-for-marketing-resource-re-allocation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['demographic', 'consumer', 'resource allocation']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of marketing resource allocation and big data analytics, with only a minimal mention of demographic factors.

For theaters, both of these decisions feature a cost-demand trade-off inherent in quality decisions: Although screening popular and recent movies brings more patrons to the theater, distributors take a higher share of the revenue for such movies. The impact of competitive entry on the incumbent\u2019s quality decisions is ambiguous, as it may simultaneously increase the competitive pressure to invest more in these dimensions of quality and also change the demand conditions that incumbents face. We find that incumbent theaters do not increase the provision of popular and recent movies in response to rival entry. To identify the role of competitive incentives, we study the differential impact of entry based on whether the entrant belongs to the same parent firm as the incumbent theaters. This comparison reveals that competitive incentives push incumbents to screen movies with high expected success more frequently and to adopt movies sooner. The product responses we document have important implications for the revenue impact of entry and the conclusions that researchers can draw from this impact. Ignoring the provision of these quality dimensions suggests cannibalization to exceed business stealing, a conclusion that is reversed when we account for endogenous product responses. We also show that our findings on popularity and recency cannot be explained by concomitant changes in theaters\u2019 other product decisions, such as the variety of movies screened.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0909","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on competitive dynamics and product decisions in the movie exhibition industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Countermarketing has a particularly long history in the tobacco industry. Efforts to reduce smoking have included excise taxes that increase the cost of consumption, smoke-free restrictions that make consumption less convenient, and antismoking advertising campaigns that highlight the dangers of tobacco use. This article presents an analysis of the relative effectiveness of these different strategies. We find that cigarette excise taxes are the most effective tool for reducing overall cigarette sales, followed by antismoking advertising. Smoke-free restrictions are not found to have a significant effect on cigarette sales. We also investigate how these various policy tools induce product substitution. This issue is of considerable importance because some countermarketing techniques may potentially shift consumers to more dangerous, higher nicotine and tar cigarettes. Specifically, we find that excise taxes levied on a per pack basis rather than based on nicotine levels often shift consumers to more dangerous products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0910","","MKS","Marketing","3","['countermarketing', 'tobacco', 'public health']","The article discusses countermarketing strategies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption, which touches on public health and consumer safety.

Previous investigations of the efficacy of such initiatives in altering consumption behavior yielded contradictory findings. In this article, we use six years of point-of-sale scanner data for milk from a sample of over 1,700 supermarkets across the United States to investigate the potential of small price incentives for inducing substitution of healthier alternatives. We exploit a pricing pattern particular to milk in the United States, whereby prices in some geographical regions are flat across whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk; whereas in other regions they are decreasing with the fat content level. The prevailing price structure is determined at a chain and regional level, and is independent of local demand conditions. This exogenous variation in price structure provides a quasi-experimental set-up to analyze the impact of small price differences on substitution across fat content. We use detailed demographics to evaluate price sensitivity and substitution patterns for different socioeconomic groups. Results show that small price differences are highly effective in inducing substitution to lower calorie options. The impact is highest for low-income households who are also most at risk for obesity. Our results suggest that a selective taxation mechanism that lowers the relative prices of healthier options, such that those price changes are reflected in shelf prices at the point-of-purchase, can serve as an effective health policy tool in the efforts to control obesity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0917","","MKS","Marketing","5","['obesity', 'socioeconomic groups', 'health policy', 'low-income households', 'price incentives']","The article discusses the impact of a fat tax on different socioeconomic groups, particularly emphasizing low-income households, which indicates a moderate focus on social equity and health policy.

When product quality is freely observable but horizontal match is not, we examine how CLI choices interact with quality and price competition in a duopoly. CLI has a competition effect in that a higher CLI of a firm increases its demand but decreases that of its rivals. In the market-covered duopoly, both qualities will decrease (increase) when the high-end (low-end) firm invests more in customer learning, and remain unchanged when they invest equally, relative to when neither firm invests. We further show that the firm with a higher relative production efficiency invests more in customer learning than the competitor. In the market-not-covered duopoly, CLI by the low-end firm also creates a market-expansion effect by inducing some additional low-end customers to sample and purchase its product. This may induce it to invest more than the high-end firm, even when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0918","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing strategies, such as customer evaluation costs and competition, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Beauty contests are widely used in procuring welfare-to-work projects, freelance services, selling online ads, real estate transactions, and hiring, dating/marriage decisions. Unlike price-only auctions, beauty contests have no closed-form bidding strategies and suffer from nonmultiplicatively separable unobserved auction heterogeneity, which makes their estimation challenging. To address these challenges, we formulate beauty contests as incomplete information games and present a two-step estimator. A key contribution of our method is its ability to account for common-knowledge auction-specific unobservables using finite unobserved types. We show that unobserved auction types and distributions of bids are nonparametrically identified and recoverable in the first step using a nonparametric Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm, and that these can then be used in the second step to recover cost distributions. We present an application of our method in the online freelancing context. We find that seller margins in this marketplace are around 15% of the bid, and that not accounting for unobserved heterogeneity can significantly bias cost estimates in this setting.

Past research has shown that a firm may offer a broader product line to attract higher demand or charge a higher price (or both), and benefit at the expense of its competitor. We show that such outcomes may be reversed, especially when consumers have relatively high valuation and low heterogeneity in their preferences for the line extension. We find that an equilibrium exists such that only one firm prefers to expand scope but profits may be higher for both firms, even in the absence of market size expansion. This is because a broader scope permits that firm to effectively price discriminate by raising prices for its core customers. The competitor optimally responds by lowering prices to gain share and earn a higher profit. Thus, higher prices for the firm expanding its product line translate into higher demand for the competing firm, thus increasing profit for both.

The old good that is turned in can either be within the same category as the new good or it may be in a different category.

This paper studies both within-category and multicategory exchange promotions and analyzes their similarities and differences. In a competitive setting with two firms, we model exchange promotions and establish the equilibrium outcomes. We find that categories in which consumers have a high level of waste aversion are more likely to have multicategory exchange promotions rather than within-category or no promotions. Multicategory exchange promotions can increase both consumers\u2019 replacement purchases and their new purchases. Interestingly, we also find that strategic considerations can lead to a prisoner\u2019s dilemma outcome in which neither firm offers any kind of exchange promotion.

It relies on rich field data from one of the world\u2019s largest telecom providers who can gauge physical crowdedness in real-time in terms of the number of active mobile users in subway trains. The telecom provider randomly sent targeted mobile ads to individual users, measured purchase rates, and surveyed purchasers and nonpurchasers. Based on a sample of 14,972 mobile phone users, the results suggest that, counterintuitively, commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond to a mobile offer by making a purchase vis-\u00e0-vis those in noncrowded trains. On average, the purchase rates measured 2.1% with fewer than two people per square meter, and increased to 4.3% with five people per square meter, after controlling for peak and off-peak times, weekdays and weekends, mobile use behaviors, and randomly sending mobile ads to users. The effects are robust to exploiting sudden variations in crowdedness induced by unanticipated train delays underground and street closures aboveground. Follow-up surveys provide insights into the causal mechanism driving this result. A plausible explanation is mobile immersion: As increased crowding invades one\u2019s physical space, people adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads. Because crowding is often associated with negative emotions such as anxiety and risk-avoidance, the findings reveal an intriguing, positive aspect of crowding: Mobile ads can be a welcome relief in a crowded subway environment. The findings have economic significance because people living in cities commute 48 minutes each way on average, and global mobile ad spending is projected to exceed $100 billion. Marketers may consider the crowdedness of a consumer\u2019s environment as a new way to boost the effectiveness of hyper-contextual mobile advertising.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0905","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mobile advertising effectiveness and consumer behavior in crowded environments, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The operational activities associated with participating in an auction, i.e., submitting the bid and the ad copy, customizing bids and ad copies based on various factors (such as the geographical region from which the query originated, the time of day and the season, the characteristics of the searcher), and continuously measuring outcomes, involve considerable effort. We call the costs that arise from such activities keyword management costs. To reduce these costs and increase advertisers\u2019 participation in keyword auctions, search engines offer an opt-in tool called broad match with automatic and flexible bidding, wherein the search engine automatically places bids on behalf of the advertisers and takes over the above activities as well. The bids are based on the search engine\u2019s estimates of the advertisers\u2019 valuations and, therefore, may be less accurate than the bids the advertisers would have turned in themselves. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine the strategic role of keyword management costs, and of broad match, in sponsored search advertising. We show that because these costs inhibit participation by advertisers in keyword auctions, the search engine has to reduce the reserve price, which reduces the search engine\u2019s profits. This motivates the search engine to offer broad match as a tool to reduce keyword management costs. If the accuracy of broad match bids is sufficiently high, advertisers adopt broad match and benefit from the cost reduction, whereas if the accuracy is very low, advertisers do not use it. Interestingly, at moderate levels of bid accuracy, advertisers individually find it attractive to reduce costs by using broad match, but competing advertisers also adopt broad match and the increased competition hurts all advertisers\u2019 profits, thus creating a \u201cprisoner\u2019s dilemma.\u201d When advertisers adopt broad match, search engine profits increase. It therefore seems natural to expect that the search engine will be motivated to improve broad match accuracy. Our analysis shows that the search engine will increase broad match accuracy up to the point where advertisers choose broad match, but that increasing the accuracy any further reduces the search engine\u2019s profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0919","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sponsored search advertising and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A Field Experiment","One of the most intriguing findings in the multichannel customer management literature is the positive association between multichannel purchasing and customer profitability. The question is whether this finding can be put into action. That is, can a firm develop a marketing campaign to increase multichannel purchasing and hence average customer profitability, and if so what are the key factors that enable success. We design and implement a randomized field experiment to investigate this question. The field experiment tests four marketing campaigns that vary in the communications message and the provision of financial incentives. We find that the multichannel/profitability relationship is actionable. A properly designed marketing campaign increases the number of multichannel customers and increases average customer profitability. That campaign\u2019s message emphasizes the benefits of multichannel shopping but does not rely on financial incentives. Moreover, we use propensity score matching to show that, after accounting for self-selection, multichannel customers are more profitable than they would be if they were not multichannel. A post-test analysis suggests that the multichannel/nonfinancial incentive campaign succeeded in inducing customers to become multichannel because it decreased customer reactance and increased perceived behavioral control.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0923","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on marketing strategies to enhance customer profitability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

If consumers substitute easily between the products produced by one firm, the firms promote one product at a time to avoid cannibalization.

Behavioral contrast and learning theories provide the bases for our understanding of these effects. Our empirical results reveal the following: (i) Across banking and investment categories, when customers have different providers, satisfaction with one lowers the retention probability in the other service. (ii) A customer who is dissatisfied with the investment service is more likely to stay with the current banking service. (iii) Significantly, we find that when the same firm is involved in both categories, dissatisfaction with the firm in the investment category spills over into the banking category thereby lowering its retention probability. We also find that: (a) among customers who are satisfied with banking (investment), more exposure to media increases retention probability; (b) although switching costs and order of acquisition affect retention, they do not show cross-category interactions with satisfaction. We then obtain implications for customer lifetime value (CLV) and show that it can increase satisfaction by leveraging both the within and across category effects. Bottom line: It is important for a company providing multiple services to measure satisfaction at the category level but to manage customers across categories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0941","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on customer satisfaction and retention in financial services without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Some price promotions apply to all quantities (20% off), some have limits on the number of units that can be purchased at a reduced price, and others only offer the discount if the volume purchased is sufficiently high. We develop a model of price promotions in the context of a direct utility model where its effects are incorporated through the budget constraint. Price promotions complicate the estimation and analysis of direct utility models because they induce kinks and points of discontinuity in the budget set. We propose a Bayesian approach to addressing these irregularities and demonstrate the ability of the direct utility model to be used in counterfactual analyses of price promotions. We investigate the stability of utility function estimates for consumers under alternative price promotions, and find that the majority of the effect of a price promotion is through the budget set, not through changes in the utility function.

We also investigate how the accuracy of social network-based scores changes when consumers can strategically construct their social networks to attain higher scores. We find that those who are motivated to improve their scores may form fewer ties and focus more on similar partners. The impact of such endogenous tie formation on the accuracy of consumer scores is ambiguous. Scores can become more accurate as a result of modifications in social networks, but this accuracy improvement may come with greater network fragmentation.

This paper proposes an adaptive decompositional framework to elicit consumers\u2019 preferences for complex products. The proposed method starts with collaborative-filtered initial part-worths, followed by an adaptive question selection process that uses a fuzzy support vector machine active learning algorithm to adaptively refine the individual-specific preference estimate after each question. Our empirical and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed method performs well for product categories equipped with as many as 70 to 100 attribute levels, which is typically considered prohibitive for decompositional preference elicitation methods. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural remedy for a long-standing challenge in adaptive question design by gauging the possibility of response errors on the fly and incorporating the results into the survey design. This research also explores in a live setting how responses from previous respondents may be used to facilitate active learning of the focal respondent\u2019s product preferences.

We find that although search engines cover smaller portions of consumer Web visits than major advertising networks, their data is of higher quality. Thus, even with the smaller information set, search engines can effectively recover consumer behavioral profiles. We also show that temporal limitations imposed on individual-level tracking abilities are likely to have a differential impact across major online businesses, and that our approach is particularly effective for temporally limited data.

First, the data are typically in an unstructured format, such as texts, images, audio, and video. Second, the sheer volume of the data makes standard analysis procedures computationally unworkable. In this study, we combine methods from cloud computing, machine learning, and text mining to illustrate how online platform content, such as Twitter, can be effectively used for forecasting. We conduct our analysis on a significant volume of nearly two billion Tweets and 400 billion Wikipedia pages. Our main findings emphasize that, by contrast to basic surface-level measures such as the volume of or sentiments in Tweets, the information content of Tweets and their timeliness significantly improve forecasting accuracy.

The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers\u2019 preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper\u2019s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0984","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical implementation of a garment recommender system aimed at improving sales and customer experience without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In practice, customer purchase history data is readily available to make such predictions, sometimes complemented with customer characteristics. Given the large product assortments maintained by online retailers, scalability of the prediction method is just as important as its accuracy. We study two classes of models that use such data to predict what a customer will buy next, i.e., a novel approach that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and mixtures of Dirichlet-Multinomials (MDM). A key benefit of a model-based approach is the potential to accommodate observed customer heterogeneity through the inclusion of predictor variables. We show that LDA can be extended in this direction while retaining its scalability. We apply the models to purchase data from an online retailer and contrast their predictive performance with that of a collaborative filter and a discrete choice model. Both LDA and MDM outperform the other methods. Moreover, LDA attains performance similar to that of MDM while being far more scalable, rendering it a promising approach to purchase prediction in large product assortments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0985","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of predictive modeling in online retail without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We model pass-through as a two-stage decision process that reflects both whether as well as how much to change the regular retail price. We show that pass-through is strongly asymmetric with respect to wholesale price increases versus decreases. Wholesale price increases are passed through to regular retail prices 70% of the time while wholesale price decreases are passed through only 9% of the time. Pass-through is also asymmetric with respect to the magnitude of the wholesale price change, with the magnitude affecting the response to wholesale price increases but not decreases. Finally, we show that covariates such as private label versus national brand, 99-cent price endings, and the time since the last wholesale price change have a much stronger impact on the first stage of the decision process (i.e., whether to change the regular retail price) than on the second stage (i.e., how much to change the regular retail price).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0947","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of price pass-through mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Exits could result in higher prices due to tempered competition or lower prices due to reduced colocation or agglomeration benefits. The net effect of these two countervailing forces remains unknown. In addition, little is known about how this effect could change depending on incumbents\u2019 geographic locations. We address this research gap by examining new car price reactions by incumbent multiproduct automobile dealerships who experience the exit of a Chrysler dealership in their local markets. We find evidence that the competition effect exceeds the colocation effect: prices increase by about 1% ($318) following an exit relative to the price change in the absence of an exit. More important, we find that the price increase is lower at dealerships more proximate to the exiting dealership than dealerships farther away for the same set of cars available across these locations. This finding suggests differences in the extent of the two forces (competition and agglomeration) at different distances from the closed dealership. We assess the generalizability of our results by looking at the impact of GM\u2019s closure of Pontiac dealerships.

Because carryover increases not only expected sales but also sales uncertainty. Consequently, the manager should incentivize the high risk-aversion salesperson with a concave compensation plan to counterbalance suboptimal customer attrition, and the low risk-aversion salesperson with a convex compensation plan that limits coasting on past efforts.

Information Provision and Search Costs","A seller often needs to determine the amount of product information to provide to consumers. We model costly consumer information search in the presence of limited information. We derive the consumer\u2019s optimal stopping rule for the search process. We find that, in general, there is an intermediate amount of information that maximizes the likelihood of purchase. If too much information is provided, some of it is not as useful for the purchase decision, the average informativeness per search occasion is too low, and consumers end up choosing not to purchase the product. If too little information is provided, consumers may end up not having sufficient information to decide to purchase the product. The optimal amount of information increases with the consumer\u2019s ex ante valuation of the product, because with greater ex ante valuation by the consumer, the firm wants to offer sufficient information for the consumer to be less likely to run out of information to check. One can also show that there is an intermediate amount of information that maximizes the consumer\u2019s expected utility from the search problem (social welfare under some assumptions). Furthermore, this amount may be smaller than that which maximizes the probability of purchase; that is, the market outcome may lead to information overload with respect to the social welfare optimum. This paper can be seen as providing conditions under which too much information may hurt consumer decision making. Numerical analysis shows also that if consumers can choose to some extent which attributes to search through (but not perfectly), or if the firm can structure the information searched by consumers, the amount of information that maximizes the probability of purchase increases, but is close to the amount of information that maximizes the probability of purchase when the consumer cannot costlessly choose which attributes to search through.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0959","","MKS","Marketing","2","['consumer', 'information', 'social welfare']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and the economics of information provision without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%\u20136% in transactions\u2019 prices.

We collaborated with a major hotel chain to launch a large scale field experiment involving 95,532 existing loyalty customers. We observed customers\u2019 hotel stays for eight months before the experiment, eight months during the experiment, and eight months after the experiment. Customers in the treatment group were asked to increase their hotel nights during the 8-month promotion by a set percentage relative to their baseline to receive a reward. Overall, the promotion led to increased purchasing in the post-promotion period. However, only 20% of customers successfully reached the goal whereas 80% missed the goal. We use a propensity score analysis to examine the distinct effects of goal achievement versus goal failure. Results show that goal attainment significantly increased post-promotion purchasing whereas goal failure significantly reduced post-promotion purchasing. Additionally, we use econometric methods to empirically test a behavioral theory of relationship-based reciprocity. We find that customers in a high status tier relationship, with the most invested in the firm, are most affected by goal failure whereas customers in a low status tier relationship, with the least invested in the firm, are most affected by goal success. Because the type of loyalty program described in this paper is widely used in a variety of industries the findings suggest that marketers should set reachable goals within loyalty promotion programs.

With targeted advertising and price discrimination, we find that, when the attractiveness of the weak segment is low, each firm advertises more intensively in its strong segment. The same result arises when the attractiveness of the weak segment is high and advertising is sufficiently expensive. Interestingly, when the attractiveness of the weak segment is high but advertising costs are sufficiently low, it is optimal for each firm to advertise more intensively in its weak segment. The paper also investigates how advertising strategies and equilibrium profits are affected by price discrimination. Compared with uniform pricing, firms can increase or reduce the intensity of advertising targeted to each segment when price discrimination is allowed.

To impress investors IPO firms might curtail their marketing budgets, which appears to inflate current earnings and provide evidence of current well-being. However, curtailing marketing budgets unexpectedly during an IPO may be a myopic practice, in that the immediate benefits of these budget cuts are offset by their longer-term adverse consequences on financial well-being. The extent of these adverse consequences in turn may be moderated by external firm factors, including strategic alliances and key customer relationships, and internal firm factors, such as the strategic emphasis on value creation versus value appropriation.

Investors seem misled during IPOs, but they correct their beliefs in the three years following the IPO and penalize these firms.

In this paper, we build a theoretical model of unorganized and organized retailing in emerging economies by carefully modeling key characteristics of the retailing environment, the retailers, the consumers, and product categories. The primary insight that we obtain is that in a competitive market comprising of only unorganized retailers, the advent of organized retailing injects efficiency into the market leading to a reduction in the number of unorganized retailers. This, in turn, makes the market less competitive. Building on this basic insight, we obtain a number of counterintuitive results. For instance, (i) the presence of organized retailing may increase the prices charged by unorganized retailers; (ii) as the consumers\u2019 transportation cost to the unorganized retailers increases, the market share of the unorganized retailing sector may increase; (iii) as the probability of bulk consumption increases and consumers prefer to purchase more from the organized retailer, prices and profits at the organized retailer may decrease; and (iv) the presence of organized retailing can lead to both consumer and social surplus being lower because consumers face higher prices at unorganized retailers and there is wastage in the economy due to bulk purchasing at organized retailers. Our model offers an explanation for certain surprising empirical observations related to retailing in emerging markets, such as why in the last few years in the Indian market the unorganized retailers who have survived the advent of organized retailing seem to be doing better. Implications from our research can provide guidance to policy makers grappling with issues related to the balanced growth of unorganized and organized retailing in emerging markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0962","","MKS","Marketing","2","['unorganized retailing', 'organized retailing', 'emerging economies']","The article primarily focuses on the economic dynamics between unorganized and organized retailing without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This article extends the recency\u2013frequency paradigm of customer-base analysis by integrating regularity in interpurchase timing in a modeling framework. By definition, regularity implies less variation in timing patterns and thus better predictability. Whereas most stochastic customer behavior models assume a Poisson process of \u201crandom\u201d purchase occurrence, allowing for regularity in the purchase timings is beneficial in noncontractual settings because it improves inferences about customers\u2019 latent activity status. This especially applies to those valuable customers who were previously very frequently active but have recently exhibited a longer purchase hiatus. A newly developed generalization of the well-known Pareto/NBD model accounts for varying degrees of regularity across customers by replacing the NBD component with a mixture of gamma distributions (labeled Pareto/GGG). The authors demonstrate the impact of incorporating regularity on forecasting accuracy using an extensive simulation study and a range of empirical applications. Even for mildly regular timing patterns, it is possible to improve customer-level predictions; the stronger the regularity, the greater the gain. Furthermore, the cost in terms of data requirements is marginal because only one additional summary statistic, in addition to recency and frequency, is needed that captures historical transaction timing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0963","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer behavior prediction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The Perils of Early Free-Trial Promotions for High-Tech Service Adoption","The proliferation of free trials for high-tech services calls for a careful study of their effectiveness, and the drivers thereof. On one hand, free trials can generate new paying subscribers by allowing consumers to become acquainted with the service free of charge. On the other hand, a disappointing trial experience might alienate potential customers, when they decide not to adopt the system and are lost for good. This dilemma is particularly worrisome in early periods, when service quality has not been \u201ctried and tested\u201d in the field, and breakdowns occur. We accommodate these phenomena in a model of consumers\u2019 free-trial and regular adoption decisions. Among other effects, it incorporates usage- and word-of-mouth-based learning about quality in a setting where quality itself is evolving. Consumers are forward-looking in that they account for changes in quality and anticipate uncertainty reduction due to trial usage. We estimate our model and run simulations on the basis of a rich and unique data set that incorporates customers\u2019 trial subscription, adoption, and usage behavior for an interactive digital television service. The results underscore that free trials constitute a double-edged sword, and that timing and consumers\u2019 usage intensity during the trial are key to the effectiveness of these promotions.

The frequency of these meetings are endogenous to the consumption choices of consumers. A consumer enjoys a social comparison benefit if her consumption decision is more socially responsible than the consumer that she meets in a social interaction and a social comparison cost if it is less socially responsible.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2015.0975","","MKS","Marketing","6","['social responsibility', 'socially responsible innovations', 'ethical']","The article discusses the incentives for firms to invest in socially responsible product innovations, highlighting themes of social responsibility and ethical consumption.

Consumers search extensively, engaging in 14 searches on average prior to purchase. Individual level search is confined to a small part of the attribute space. Early search is highly predictive of the characteristics of the camera eventually purchased. Search paths through the attribute space are state dependent and display \u201clock-in\u201d as the search unfolds. Finally, the first-time discovery of the chosen alternative usually takes place toward the end of the search sequence.

Moreover, product researchers often evaluate a large number of these attributes (e.g., >50) in applied studies, making standard valuation techniques such as conjoint analysis difficult to implement. Product researchers instead rely on ratings data to assess features for which the respondent has had actual experience. In this paper we develop a method of monetizing rating data to standardize product evaluations among respondents. The adjusted data are shown to increase the accuracy of purchase predictions by about 20% relative to existing methods of scale adjustment, leading to better inference in models using ratings data. We demonstrate our method using data from a large scale product use study by a packaged goods manufacturer.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0980","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for improving product research accuracy without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

We examine three information-sharing formats: no information sharing (i.e., the manufacturer ex ante commits to not sharing its forecast), voluntary information sharing (i.e., the manufacturer makes the sharing decision ex post after receiving the forecast), and mandatory information sharing (i.e., the manufacturer is mandated to share its forecast). We characterize the equilibrium outcomes under the three sharing formats and investigate the firms\u2019 preferences regarding these formats. It is shown that when the retailer is risk-neutral, both firms are indifferent between voluntary and mandatory sharing. Among the three formats, ex ante, the retailer prefers the no-sharing format whereas the manufacturer prefers the mandatory-sharing format. In addition, we find that a more accurate forecast benefits both firms under voluntary- and mandatory-sharing formats, but may hurt both firms under the no-sharing format. Finally, we show that risk aversion plays a critical role in the firms\u2019 sharing decisions and the impact of forecast accuracy. Specifically, when the retailer is risk-averse, the manufacturer may prefer the no-sharing format over the voluntary-sharing format, and improving forecast accuracy may hurt both firms even under voluntary sharing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0981","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand forecasting and information sharing in a distribution channel without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the first six months following generic entry, it is more effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug contraindications and indications, compared to other periods, to positively differentiate from generics. In the first six months following branded entry, it is less effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug indications and costs, given increased competitive clutter. We also document substantial heterogeneity among doctors in their response to information content. Our model is helpful for analysts to more accurately assess the effectiveness of detailing.

This is especially true in countries such as China, which are experiencing a big rush toward e-commerce. The emergence of such platforms gives researchers the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of such platforms by focusing on the growth of both buyers and sellers. In this research, we build a utility-based model to quantify both cross and direct network effects on Alibaba Group\u2019s Taobao.com, the world\u2019s largest online C2C platform (based in China). Specifically, we investigate the relative contributions of different factors that affect the growth of buyers and sellers on the platform. Our results suggest that the direct network effects do not play a big role in the platform\u2019s growth (we detect a small positive direct network effect on buyer growth and no direct network effect on seller growth). More importantly, we find a significant, large and positive cross-network effect on both sides of the platform. In other words, the installed base of either side of the platform has propelled the growth of the other side (and thus the overall growth). Interestingly, this cross-network effect is asymmetric with the installed base of sellers having a much larger effect on the growth of buyers than vice versa. The growth in the number of buyers is driven primarily by the seller\u2019s installed base and product variety with increasing importance of product variety. The growth in the number of sellers is driven by buyer\u2019s installed base, buyer quality, and product price with increasing importance of buyer quality. We also investigate the nature of these cross-network effects over time. We find that the cross-network effect of sellers on buyers increases and then decreases to reach a stable level. By contrast, the cross-network effect of buyers on sellers is relatively stable. We discuss the policy implications of these findings for C2C platforms in general and Taobao in particular.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer-to-consumer platforms and their growth dynamics without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We jointly estimate the two models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with a unique panel data set of 1,979 mergers between 4,444 firms across industries and countries from 1992 to 2008. We find that similarity in national culture and technical knowledge has a positive effect on partner selection and post-merger innovation. Anticipated synergy from subindustry similarity, however, is not realized in post-merger innovation. Furthermore, some key synergy sources are unanticipated when selecting a merger partner. For example, financial synergy from higher total assets and complementarity in total assets and debt leverage as well as knowledge synergy from breadth and depth of knowledge positively influence innovation but not partner selection. Furthermore, factors that dilute synergy (e.g., higher debt levels) are unanticipated, and firms merge with firms that detract from their innovation potential. Overall, the results reveal some incongruity between anticipated and realized synergy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0978","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of merger synergy and innovation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The inferences obtained are then used to examine the effects of visit patterns on purchase dynamics across store visits. Using Internet clickstream data at an online retailer, we find that online store visit patterns tend to be clustered with significant variation across customers in terms of the number and size of visit clusters as well as the visit frequencies, both within and between clusters. Furthermore, the conversion rates vary significantly, depending on store visit patterns, such that they tend to be higher at later visits within a visit cluster, compared with earlier visits. The proposed model thereby offers superior fit and predictive performance than benchmark models that ignore clustered visit patterns and their impact on purchase behavior.

As such, they are often considered exempt from the sort of sample selectivity artifacts widely documented in empirical research, in part because participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions. To conserve time and resources, experiments often focus on items participants have chosen or are familiar with, for example, postchoice satisfaction ratings, certain free recall tasks, or specifying consideration sets preceding brand choice. When consumer input even partially influences the items about which researchers request subsequent data, the potential for item selectivity arises. In such situations, analyses are contingent on both the choice context(s) of the experiment and the alternatives participants elect to evaluate, potentially leading to substantial item selectivity overall and to differing degrees across conditions. We examine situations in which a nonignorable \u201cchoose one of many\u201d (polytomous) selection process limits which items offer up subsequent information, and develop methods to allow substantive results to pertain to the full set of items, not only those selected. The framework is illustrated via two experiments in which participants choose and then evaluate a frequently purchased consumer good as well as data first examined by Ratner et al. [Ratner RK, Kahn BE, Kahneman D (1999) Choosing less-preferred experiences for the sake of variety. J. Consumer Res. 26(1):1\u201315]. Results indicate substantial item selectivity that, when corrected for, can lead to markedly different interpretations of focal variable effects, such as large effect size changes and even sign reversal. Moreover, failing to flexibly account for item selectivity across experimental conditions, even in well-designed experimental settings, can lead to inaccurate substantive inferences about consumers\u2019 evaluative criteria. We further demonstrate robustness to theoretically driven (but not overtly misspecified) selection rules and provide researchers with a simple, \u201ctwo-step\u201d exploratory procedure akin to a \u201ccontrol function\u201d approach\u2014involving just one additional variable added to standard models\u2014to determine whether and to what degree item selectivity may be affecting their substantive results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991","","MKS","Marketing","2","['selectivity', 'consumer', 'experimental']","The article primarily focuses on methodological issues in experimental research without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

We also find that firms with strong labor unions withhold good news during the labor negotiation period and release it in a gradual fashion afterward and that this pattern is more prominent than that of firms with weak or no unions, implying that managers time news disclosures according to bargaining schedules to achieve better outcomes in labor negotiations.

However, empirical evidence is mixed. We conduct a meta-analysis to summarize and explain the heterogeneity in the results in the literature using hand-collected information from 101 studies in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America from 1970 to 2010. We find that strong relationships are generally beneficial for borrowers, but lending outcomes differ across the relationships\u2019 dimensions. Long-lasting, exclusive, and synergy-creating bank relationships are associated with higher credit volume and lower loan rates. These benefits are more likely in the United States and in countries where bank competition is high. They are not related to the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in an economy, suggesting that prevalence of relationship lending does not necessarily come along with borrower benefits.

The firm operates under a capital budget for financing the capacity investment, and an operating budget, which is uncertain in the capacity investment stage, for financing the production. We investigate how the tightening of the capital budget and a lower financial flexibility in the production stage (the likelihood of having a sufficient operating budget) shape the optimal technology choice. We find that the dominant regime is one where dedicated technology should be adopted for a larger investment cost range, and thus, is the best response to the tighter capital budget, whereas flexible technology is the best response to lower financial flexibility. We identify the key roles that the capacity intensity (the ratio of unit capacity cost to total unit capacity and production cost) of each technology and the pooling value of operating budget with dedicated technology, which brings this technology closer to flexible technology in terms of the resource network\u2019s flexibility, play in a budget-constrained environment. Managerially, our results underline that in the presence of financial constraints, firms should manage technology adoption together with plant location, which shapes capacity intensity, or product portfolio, which shapes financial flexibility.

This article analyzes how revenue and cash-flow volatility are influenced by own and competitive marketing spending volatility, by the level of marketing spending, by the responsiveness to own marketing spending, and by competitive response. From market response theory, we derive propositions about the influence of these variables on revenue and cash-flow volatility. In addition, we extend the Dorfman\u2013Steiner theorem to derive the optimal level and volatility of expenditures if volatility effects are taken into account. Based on a large sample of 99 pharmaceutical brands in four clinical categories and four European countries, we test for the empirical relevance of the propositions and assess the magnitude of the different sources of marketing-induced performance volatility. We find broad support for the predicted volatility effects. Volatility elasticities are significant and may be as large as 1.10 for cash-flow variance with respect to marketing responsiveness. The findings imply that common volatility-increasing marketing practices such as price promotions or volatile advertising plans may be effective at the top line, but they could turn out to be ineffective after all costs are taken into account. Optimal marketing volatility needs to trade off sales effectiveness and extra costs resulting from marketing volatility. This paper was accepted by Pradeep K.

Our model posits technology adaptation behaviors as a key linking mechanism between IT implementation and employee job outcomes, thus offering a holistic nomological network of technology adaptation behaviors. Two field studies conducted over a period of six months, with four waves of data collection each, in two organizations (N = 211 and N = 181) implementing two different ITs, supported the model. We found that employees performed four different technology adaptation behaviors\u2014exploration-to-innovate, exploitation, exploration-to-revert, and avoidance\u2014based on whether they appraised an IT as an opportunity or a threat and whether they had perceptions of control over an IT. Employees\u2019 experiential engagements (i.e., user participation and training effectiveness) and psychological engagements (i.e., user involvement and management support) during the implementation jointly determined their appraisal of an IT.

To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED. We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance, such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient\u2019s service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient\u2019s admission and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation delays throughout the day. The insights gained from our model can help hospital managers to choose among different policies to implement depending on the choice of objective, such as to reduce the peak waiting in the morning or to reduce daily waiting time statistics.

With information contracting, the retailer has an incentive to share information when either production diseconomy/economy is large or competition is intense.

We examine these issues in the context of the Olympic Games, comparing country-level performance outcomes across Olympic sports. We find that past performance is predictive of current performance in all sports, but the effect is stronger in subjective outcome sports versus objective outcome sports. That is, past performance is a better predictor of future performance in sports where external judges and referees can influence the outcomes.

Recent applications include dynamic assortment design, Internet advertising, dynamic pricing, and the control of queues. The standard mathematical formulation for a bandit problem makes the strong assumption that the decision maker has a full characterization of the joint distribution of the rewards, and that \u201carms\u201d under this distribution are independent. These assumptions are not satisfied in many applications, and the out-of-sample performance of policies that optimize a misspecified model can be poor. Motivated by these concerns, we formulate a robust bandit problem in which a decision maker accounts for distrust in the nominal model by solving a worst-case problem against an adversary (\u201cnature\u201d) who has the ability to alter the underlying reward distribution and does so to minimize the decision maker\u2019s expected total profit. Structural properties of the optimal worst-case policy are characterized by using the robust Bellman (dynamic programming) equation, and arms are shown to be no longer independent under nature\u2019s worst-case response. One implication of this is that index policies are not optimal for the robust problem, and we propose, as an alternative, a robust version of the Gittins index. Performance bounds for the robust Gittins index are derived by using structural properties of the value function together with ideas from stochastic dynamic programming duality. We also investigate the performance of the robust Gittins index policy when applied to a Bayesian webpage design problem. In the presence of model misspecification, numerical experiments show that the robust Gittins index policy not only outperforms the classical Gittins index policy, but also substantially reduces the variability in the out-of-sample performance.

Here we propose a formal measure of what we label \u201cstructural virality\u201d that interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its popularity through a single, large broadcast and that which grows through multiple generations with any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use this notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast. Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new directions for future modeling efforts.

Entrepreneurs are only found to be unique in their lower degree of loss aversion, and not in their risk or ambiguity aversion.

We model a market comprised of an incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a signal about the consumer\u2019s demand, which may be high or low. We first confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since, regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level. However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as well as consumers. In addition, we show that compared to the advance purchase contract, all the firms except the incumbent manufacturer can be better off using public information sharing under a simple wholesale price contract.

In a capacitated environment, wait times act as a signal of quality for uninformed consumers because, due to informed consumers in the population, low (high) quality products tend to generate shorter (longer) wait times. Hence, longer wait times may increase uninformed consumers\u2019 perceived quality, and they may still purchase the product, even when the wait time is long.

Our treatments vary the cost differences between firms in tiers 1 and 2. We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it outperforms the common assumption of leader\u2013follower negotiations. We find a significant anchoring effect from a firm\u2019s first bid but no effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect. We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while not compromising closure rates. Buy-side firms achieve much smaller price changes from anticoncessionary tactics and risk reduced closure, yielding no net benefit.

We propose that some employees divert effort toward unproductive activities to learn about their own fitness for alternative employment. Based on the results of this costly learning experience, or \u201cexperiment,\u201d some employees will transition into other firms or launch their own ventures, whereas others will remain at the incumbent firm. We develop a theoretical model to explicate these propositions and test them using four data sets from the mutual fund and hedge fund industries. We find evidence that managers who engage in excessive risk taking at mutual funds are subsequently more likely to join or start hedge funds, although there is little evidence that this risk taking is intended to signal quality to outside observers.

Ore produced at each mine, in each period, is transported by rail to a set of ports and blended into products for shipping. Each port forms these blends to a specification, as stipulated in contracts with downstream customers. This problem belongs to a class of multiple producer/consumer scheduling problems in which producers are able to generate a range of products, a combination of which are required by consumers to meet specified demands. In practice, short-term schedules are formed independently at each mine, tasked with achieving a grade and quality target outlined in a medium-term plan. Because of uncertainty in the data available to a medium-term planner and the dynamics of the mining environment, such targets may not be feasible in the short term. In this paper, we present an algorithm in which the grade and quality targets assigned to each mine are iteratively adapted, ensuring the satisfaction of blending constraints at each port while generating schedules for each mine that maximise resource utilisation.

We posit that managers know before analysts when extremely good earnings news is developing, but can have incentives to allow the earnings news to surprise the market at the earnings announcement. In particular, managers can use an extreme positive earnings surprise to attract investor attention when they believe their stock is neglected and future performance is expected to be strong. Analysts, who must allocate scarce resources across many firms, can also be inattentive and miss signals that suggest good performance is going to be announced. Using various proxies for extreme positive earnings surprises, management expectations for future performance and desire for attention, and analyst neglect, we find evidence that an extreme positive earnings surprise is a predictable event. These findings are incremental to controlling for a firm\u2019s information environment, earnings volatility, and operating leverage.

This paper develops the theory of contextual deliberation as a potential explanation for behavioral phenomena of preference construction. When preference ordering in a choice set is ex ante unknown and state dependent, decision makers can engage in information acquisition activities (i.e., deliberation) before choice to improve knowledge about the state-dependent preference ordering. Choice context can thus influence ex post preference ordering through affecting the incentive to deliberate. Consequently, contextual deliberation may lead to preference construction and give rise to seemingly irrational behavioral phenomena such as the compromise effect and the choice overload effect.

An Empirical Investigation into Leverage and Union Strikes","We use contract negotiation data to study how leverage affects the interaction between firms and an important nonfinancial stakeholder, labor unions. Consistent with the idea that leverage diminishes the bargaining position of labor, we find that unions are less likely to strike when a firm has high leverage or increases leverage prior to a contract negotiation. We also find large leverage increases after a strike, consistent with the idea that firms intentionally use leverage to improve their bargaining position. This poststrike increase in leverage is particularly pronounced when the union wins the strike. Moreover, we do not find any clear indication that such increases in leverage are linked to changes in investments. In addition, firms that experience a strike subsequently invest more internationally and in right-to-work states where union are afforded fewer legal protections, and they increase their disposal of production units that are located in states where strikes have occurred.

With supplier competition, SR production positively influences consumers\u2019 buying decisions and suppliers offering SR products achieve significantly higher profits, as long as their price is not too high. Our results yield valuable insights into the possibilities and limitations of promoting SR production through consumer behavior, and they provide evidence for positive effects of competition on moral behavior.

We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP\u2019s benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4%\u201313% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy.

We identify two general conditions under which tougher competition strengthens the firm\u2019s ability to commit to a focused strategy. Under these conditions, competition fosters commitment for two reasons: (i) competition reduces the value of the option to diversify (the contestability effect), and (ii) competition increases the importance of being efficient (the efficiency effect). We use a number of different models of imperfect competition to illustrate the applicability of our results. Our examples suggest that the contestability effect is very general. In contrast, the efficiency effect often requires further conditions, which are specific to the nature of competition in each model.

This paper investigates the role of market information in DRAM manufacturing and the consequences of allowing information sharing in the industry. An oligopoly model of competition with correlated private information is developed in which firms make decisions about production and capacity. In this setting, firms consider the information their competitors are likely to hold, conditional on their own. We find that both firms and customers benefit when firms share information with their competitors. In particular, sharing information is profitable because market price decreases slowly with overproduction.

The chance of success depends on the viability of the project and the effort of the agent. As the project proceeds without success, doubts grow as to whether the project is viable. To motivate continued effort, the firm must promise the agent a generous reward if success is achieved during the late stage of development. However, rewarding late success undermines effort incentives in the early stage.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data\u2013based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate\u2019s profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates \u201cweak signals\u201d of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

We first estimate a multiple-input, multiple-outcome production frontier, which defines the attainable set of outcomes from given inputs. We then recover unobserved input costs and calculate how expenditure on inputs affects outcomes and revenues. We find that the per-dollar return from expenditure on gates, or more effective management of existing gate capacity, is three times larger than the per-dollar returns from other inputs. Next, we use the estimated trade-offs faced by carriers along the frontier to measure the value to carriers of reducing delays. Finally, we calculate the improvement in carriers\u2019 outcomes and profits if their operational inefficiencies are eliminated.

The entrant might sell under its own brand and compete with an incumbent, become a supplier to the incumbent, or both. Findings reveal that when consumers perceive the firms are horizontally and vertically differentiated, the entrant profits by simultaneously entering the market and establishing an OEM arrangement with the incumbent. In such competitive scenarios, both buyer and seller increase profits by agreeing on wholesale prices that are not too low, which softens both horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms. Findings also show that the incumbent may prefer to pay high wholesale prices to the entrant even if the incumbent had the option to source the product independently at a lower marginal cost. When firms have the capability of producing each other\u2019s product lines, supply relationships between them can still happen in equilibrium. In this case, an interesting result is that firms may optimally select to differentiate production and, because of the OEM relationship, sell the same product qualities to consumers. The reason for this outcome is that the OEM arrangement with differentiated production causes a strategic effect that reduces the firms\u2019 aggressiveness when competing for consumers. Under certain conditions, the OEM arrangement can completely nullify the horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms. This paper was accepted by J.

Prior work on this topic assumes that the hacker\u2019s effort is independent of the vendor\u2019s decision to release the patch freely or not. Clearly, if the patch is not available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a game-theoretic model, where the hacker\u2019s decision is endogenous. With this model, we find that the hacker\u2019s effort may, on the one hand, decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but, on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the hacker\u2019s behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The endogeneity of the hacker\u2019s actions drives several of our findings that have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the differentiation. In such a case, there may be more pirates in the restricted-patch case than when the patch is freely available, a result that runs counter to typical arguments provided for restricting patches.

Consistent with concerns about coordination problems and higher indebtedness, we find that this reaction is more pronounced the larger the outside loan and it is muted if the initial bank\u2019s existing and future loans retain seniority and are protected with valuable collateral.

However, in the absence of specific prominence requirements, lenders can conceal the interest rate in the fine print while still complying with the law. I examine the effect of such a strategy using a field experiment in Brazil in which a credit card company offered their clients payment plans to pay off their balances. Using randomized contract interest rates and the degree of rate disclosure, I show that most clients are rate sensitive, whether or not rates are prominently disclosed. The elasticity of payment plan enrollment with respect to the interest rate ranges from \u22120.711 to \u22120.880. High-risk clients are an exception; these clients are rate sensitive only when disclosure is prominent. I also show that clients are influenced by nudges that favor longer-term contracts.

A strategy adopted by some websites is to continually track and display the number of deals sold by a merchant. We investigate the strategic implications of displaying deal sales and the website\u2019s incentive to implement this feature. We analyze a market in which a merchant offering an experience good is privately informed of its type. Whereas daily deals cannibalize a merchant\u2019s revenue from experienced consumers, we show that, by displaying deal sales, the website can transform this cannibalization into an advantage. Displaying deal sales can leverage discounted sales to experienced consumers to help a high-quality merchant signal its type and acquire new consumers at a higher margin. Signaling is supported through observational learning from displayed deal sales since it reveals how experienced consumers respond to the deal. Nevertheless, the website may not implement this feature if signaling entails too much distortion in the merchant\u2019s deal price. We also find that it can be optimal for the website to offer the merchant an up-front subsidy, but only if the website displays deal sales. Our analysis leads to managerial insights for daily deal websites. This paper was accepted by J.

Yet the credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp\u2019s filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake\u2014and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants\u2014which benefit less from Yelp\u2014are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further light on the economic incentives behind a business\u2019s decision to leave fake reviews.

Public access defibrillation programs, which deploy automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for bystander use in an emergency, reduce the time to defibrillation and improve survival rates. In this paper, we develop models to guide the deployment of public AEDs. Our models generalize existing location models and incorporate differences in bystander behavior. We formulate three mixed integer nonlinear models and derive equivalent integer linear reformulations or easily computable bounds. We use kernel density estimation to derive a spatial probability distribution of cardiac arrests that is used for optimization and model evaluation. Using data from Toronto, Canada, we show that optimizing AED deployment outperforms the existing approach by 40% in coverage, and substantial gains can be achieved through relocating existing AEDs.

Executive Search and Gender Inequality in Hiring for Top Management Jobs","We study the sources of women\u2019s underrepresentation in hiring for top management jobs by focusing on the context of executive search. Using data that include proprietary information on 10,970 individuals considered by a search firm, we examine the sources of the low proportion of women placed in senior roles. Contrary to received wisdom, we find limited evidence that demand-side screeners strongly contribute to gender disadvantage in this setting. What gender differences exist tend to play out at the start of the hiring process and are driven both by supply-side and demand-side actors. Once considered for a position, women are no less likely than men to be hired\u2014though they are slightly less likely to be interviewed by the search firm.

When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase. Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering complete information on all the products and need to make decisions under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in the consumer\u2019s consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for information and purchases a product if the difference between the expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision. We also find that it is optimal for a monopolistic seller of multiple products to facilitate information search for low-valuation consumers and obfuscate information for those with high valuations.

In such \u201cblind queues,\u201d customers make their joining/balking decisions based on limited information about the service provider\u2019s operational parameters (from past service experiences, reviews, etc.) and queue lengths. We analyze a firm serving customers making decisions under arbitrary beliefs about the service parameters in an observable queue for a service with a known price. By proposing an ordering for the balking threshold distributions in the customer population, we are able to compare the effects of customer beliefs on the queue. We show that, although revealing the service information to customers improves revenues under certain conditions, it may destroy consumer welfare or social welfare. Given a market size, consumer welfare can be significantly reduced when a fast server announces its true service parameter. When revenue is higher under some beliefs, one would expect the congestion to also be higher because more customers join, but we show that congestion may not necessarily increase.

I use a laboratory experiment to determine the effect of winning and losing in a competition on the willingness to seek further challenges. Participants compete in two-person tournaments in an arithmetic task and are then informed of their score and the outcome of the competition. Participants then have to decide on a performance target for a second round: the higher the target, the higher the potential reward, but participants who do not reach the target earn nothing. Conditional on the score, winning or losing is exogenous. I find that, conditional on first-round scores, losers go for a more challenging target. Losers also perform worse, leading to lower earnings and a higher probability of failure. These results are driven by gender-specific reactions to winning and losing: men react to losing by picking a more challenging target while women lower their performance.

On the one hand, the infrastructure put into place to meet schools\u2019 needs can also serve households. On the other hand, students get acquainted with the Internet at school and signal its usefulness to adults at home who, consequently, can be more likely to adopt it. In this paper, we model the roles that broadband use at school and Internet adoption in neighboring households play in the decision to adopt the Internet at home and measure their effects empirically. We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We use two different sets of instruments for the schools\u2019 broadband use to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results. We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set this effect accounts for about 17% of the increase in home Internet adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38% of the total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009. These results show that wiring schools with broadband is an effective policy to lower the barriers for Internet adoption at home and as such contributes to accelerating the pace of broadband diffusion.

We hypothesize that this finding obtains because periods of optimism attract equity investment by unsophisticated, overconfident, traders in risky opportunities (high beta stocks), whereas such traders stay along the sidelines during pessimistic periods. Thus, high beta stocks become overpriced in optimistic periods, but during pessimistic periods, noise trading is reduced, so that traditional beta pricing prevails. Unconditional on sentiment, these effects offset each other. Although rational explanations cannot completely be ruled out, analyses using earnings expectations, fund flows, the probability of informed trading, and order imbalances do provide evidence that noise traders are more bullish about high beta stocks when sentiment is optimistic, whereas investor behavior appears to accord more closely with rationality during pessimistic periods, supporting our hypothesis.

We measure the relationship between the variation in national-brand purchase shares and five store-specific marketing mix factors: prices, assortment shares, features, displays, and promotion intensity. We do this by first demonstrating the extent to which purchase shares of the top two national brands across six different categories vary across markets, accounts (defined as chain\u2013market interactions) and stores: market-level variation accounts for approximately 30% of the weekly purchase share variation across stores, whereas account-level and store-level variation explain an additional 13% and 5% of the variation, respectively. We then measure the extent to which assortment, pricing, feature, display, and promotion activities affect the purchase shares of the top national brands. We find that price and assortment share are the two most important point-of-sale factors in determining a brand\u2019s purchase share. We also examine how the proximity to a brand\u2019s city of origin, the assortment share of a store\u2019s private label, the extent of retail competition, and the demographics of the store\u2019s neighborhood affect the purchase share\u2019s sensitivity to the point-of-sale marketing mix, revealing several subtle effects. Finally, we measure the extent to which the variation in top national-brand purchase shares is explained by these five factors. We find that, on average, approximately 56% of the variation in national-brand purchase shares can be attributed to these five factors.

In this paper, we build a model to estimate the excess mortality and incremental health expenditures associated with exposure to the following 10 workplace stressors: unemployment, lack of health insurance, exposure to shift work, long working hours, job insecurity, work\u2013family conflict, low job control, high job demands, low social support at work, and low organizational justice. Our model uses input parameters obtained from publicly accessible data sources. We estimated health spending from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and joint probabilities of workplace exposures from the General Social Survey, and we conducted a meta-analysis of the epidemiological literature to estimate the relative risks of poor health outcomes associated with exposure to these stressors. The model was designed to overcome limitations with using inputs from multiple data sources. Specifically, the model separately derives optimistic and conservative estimates of the effect of multiple workplace exposures on health, and uses optimization to calculate upper and lower bounds around each estimate, which accounts for the correlation between exposures. We find that more than 120,000 deaths per year and approximately 5%\u20138% of annual healthcare costs are associated with and may be attributable to how U.S. companies manage their work forces. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to management practices as important contributors to health outcomes and costs in the United States.

We illustrate the welfare benefit of this subsidy and study how the social costs and benefits change with the duration of industry distress. In our model, two firms engage in socially wasteful competition for survival in a declining industry. Firms differ on two dimensions: exogenous productivity and endogenously chosen amount of debt financing, resulting in a two-dimensional war of attrition. Debt financing increases incentives to exit, which, although costly for the firm, is socially beneficial. These benefits decline as industry distress shortens. Our normative model sheds light on why the debt tax subsidy still persists around the world.

A Test Using Disclosure Regulation","Extant theory claims a firm\u2019s information environment impacts the choice between debt and equity financing. However, empirical evidence supporting this contention is limited. We evaluate this relation within the context of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), which prohibited the use of selective disclosure. We find that firms with high proprietary costs of public disclosure are more likely to resort to debt financing following the passage of Reg FD. This relation is not sensitive to whether a firm has relied on selective disclosure in the pre-Reg FD regime. We also evaluate changes in firm disclosure policy and find that firms that adopted an expansive public disclosure policy are more likely to turn to equity financing. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the pecking order theory: firms with deteriorated firm information environments increase their use of less information-sensitive debt, whereas firms with improved information environments favor the use of equity financing.

The unique equilibrium of the stage game is in mixed strategies with positive probabilities of shirking/inspecting while combined payoffs are maximized when the employee works and the employer does not inspect. We examine the effects of allowing the employer discretion to sanction or reward the employee after observing stage game payoffs. When employers have limited discretion, and can only apply sanctions and/or rewards following an inspection, we find that both instruments are equally effective in reducing shirking and increasing joint earnings. When employers have discretion to reward and/or sanction independently of whether they inspect, we find that rewards are more effective than sanctions. In treatments where employers can combine sanctions and rewards, employers rely mainly on rewards, and outcomes closely resemble those of treatments where only rewards are possible.

Such information is useful, not only to the consumers that have not yet purchased the product but also to the firm. The informativeness of the consumer-generated quality information depends, however, on the volume of consumers who share their opinions and, thus, depends on the initial sales volume. Hence, via its initial price, the firm not only influences its revenue but also controls the quality information flow over time. The firm may either enhance or dampen the quality information flow via increasing or decreasing initial sales. The corresponding pricing strategy to steer the quality information flow is not always intuitive. Compared to the case without consumer-generated quality information, the firm may reduce the initial sales and lower the initial price. Interestingly, the firm may get strictly worse off due to the consumer-generated quality information. Even when the firm benefits from consumer-generated quality information, it may prefer less accurate information. Consumer surplus can also decrease due to the consumer-generated quality information, contrary to the conventional wisdom that word of mouth should help consumers.

However, general wisdom has traditionally ignored the effect of these practices on supplier incentives. In this paper we find that, when suppliers make pricing decisions, dual sourcing does not always lead to higher supply chain efficiency or buyer profits as compared to single sourcing. This loss takes place when suppliers commit to prices up front, before any possible forecast change, but not when they delay the price quotes after demand forecasts have been updated. Specifically, with up-front price commitment, dual sourcing leads to inflation of supplier prices because expensive suppliers will still receive part of the business if they are sufficiently quick. Thus, when supplier prices are endogenous, double marginalization may offset the additional buyer profit enabled by higher ordering flexibility. In contrast, with delayed price quotes, a buyer will find dual sourcing beneficial because single sourcing locks it into a monopolistic supplier that extracts most of the available rent.

Three unique insights emerge. Interactions between the producer and other team members have a greater effect on revenues than other repeated pairs for which consumers might have preferences. In many instances, repeated interactions with current team members are more revenue enhancing than individual successes in past movies.

Collaboration makes it cheaper to enhance such quality, so building innovation ecosystems results in firms investing more than if collaboration were impossible.

To disentangle the joint effects of performance on compensation and distress risk, we focus our analyses on new CEOs. Our results indicate that financial distress risk affects compensation through two channels. First, new CEOs receive significantly more compensation when financial distress risk is higher. This finding is consistent with CEOs receiving a compensation premium for bearing this risk since CEOs experience large personal costs if their firms later become financially distressed. Second, financial distress risk is associated with the incentives provided to new CEOs; distress risk is positively associated with pay-performance sensitivity and equity-based compensation and is negatively associated with cash bonuses. Further, financial distress risk is positively associated with pay-risk sensitivity for new CEOs. These findings suggest that financial distress risk alters the nature of the agency relationship in ways that lead firms to provide CEOs with more equity-based incentives. We also build on research that finds a positive relation between forced turnover risk and CEO compensation. Our analyses suggest the compensation effects of forced turnover risk appear to be mainly attributable to financial distress risk.

The Role of Behavioral Motives","We study a seller\u2019s optimal pricing and inventory strategies when behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives affect consumers\u2019 purchase decisions. In particular, the seller chooses between two pricing strategies, markdown or everyday low price, and determines the optimal prices and inventory level. Two salient behavioral motives that impact consumers\u2019 purchase decisions and the seller\u2019s optimal strategies are anticipated regret and misperception of product availability. Regret arises when a consumer initially chooses to wait but encounters stockout later, or when the consumer buys the product at the high price but realizes that the product is still available at the markdown price. In addition, consumers often perceive the product\u2019s future availability to be different than its actual availability. We determine and quantify that both regret and availability misperception have significant operational and profit implications for the seller. For example, ignoring these behavioral factors can result in up to 10% profit losses. We contrast the roles of consumers\u2019 strategic (pecuniary) motives with their behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives in affecting purchase, pricing, and inventory decisions. The presence of the behavioral motives reinstates the profitability of markdown over everyday low price, in sharp contrast to prior studies of only strategic motives that suggest the contrary. We characterize how and why strategic versus behavioral motives affect decisions in distinctive manners. In doing so, this paper also introduces and determines the behavioral benefits of pricing in leveraging consumers\u2019 behavioral regularities. We advocate that tactics that may intensify consumers\u2019 misperception of availability, such as disclosing low inventory levels, can have a far-reaching impact on improving the seller\u2019s profit.

Conformance quality represents a hospital\u2019s level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care, whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between hospital\u2019s caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from 3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However, conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions\u2013costs trade-off is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers\u2019 ability to respond to patient\u2019s explicit needs, whereas communication-focused EQ measures caregivers\u2019 ability to engage in meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission rates. Moreover, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity. Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results in reduced readmission rates. However, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting that these dimensions might compete for resources. Taken together, our results suggest that hospital administrators can mitigate the trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs by prioritizing communication-focused EQ over response-focused EQ.

By using a difference-in-difference estimator, we find that Walmart gains 41% in weekly revenue from the conversion. Decomposing the revenue gains into components attributable to store visits and per-visit expenditures, we find that the majority of these gains were due to larger expenditures, with a much smaller impact from store visits. By contrast, among competing retailers, grocery stores experience the most significant loss (20% weekly revenue) mostly from fewer store visits, with a much smaller impact attributable to per-visit expenditure. Taken together, these findings show that consumers may benefit from reduced shopping costs by making fewer overall trips and increasing their Walmart basket sizes. In addition, we find that overall revenue gains for Walmart from conversion outweigh the small cannibalization loss at the existing Walmart supercenters located farther away. Finally, from category-level analyses, we find evidence of increases in category-level spending in preexisting categories in the converted supercenter. However, we also find that positive demand externality is more pronounced in food categories, mainly as a result of increased purchase incidence.

We document that debt returns lag equity returns less when debt research coverage exists, which is consistent with debt analysts facilitating the process by which available information is impounded in debt prices. The effect of debt research on the debt market\u2019s lag is incremental to, but comparable in magnitude to, hedge fund ownership\u2019s effect. No such effect exists for credit rating agencies. We also find that the dissemination of debt reports has an immediate effect on return volatility in both markets, which is consistent with debt analysts providing new information to securities markets. Increased return covariation suggests that this information impacts the pricing of debt and equity in the same direction. A large percentage of debt reports do not induce any immediate debt market return reaction but do induce an equity return reaction, which is consistent with new information being provided despite the absence of a debt market reaction. Finally, there is a systematic variation in the debt market\u2019s trading and return reactions to debt research. Timely reports and those by high-reputation brokers induce a quicker trading response, thus enhancing liquidity, whereas only timely reports induce a greater return response.

The self- (customer) decision is whether to queue or balk, and the social (system administrator) goal is to maximize the profit of the whole system. Whereas the self-optimal policy is relatively easy to obtain, the socially optimal policy, which is of more practical importance, often requires a tedious and ad hoc analysis as a result of external effects. We will introduce a simple and general approach to determine the optimal admission policy. The main idea of this approach is to consider a special rule that admits an extra customer who is served only by the surplus capacity and bears all the increased waiting time and thus incurs no external cost. The approach applies in principle to queues with exponential service. In fact, for such queues, a marginal analysis based on this rule will explore the properties of the optimal social policy and lead to a general procedure for deriving the optimal threshold.

Cultivated donors generate much more revenue than new donors, but also lapse with time, making it important to steadily draw in new cultivations. The direct-mail budget is limited, but better-designed mailings can improve success rates without increasing costs. We propose an empirical model to analyze the effectiveness of several design approaches used in practice, based on a massive data set covering 8.6 million direct-mail communications with donors to the American Red Cross during 2009\u20132011. We find evidence that mailed appeals are more effective when they emphasize disaster preparedness and training efforts over post-disaster cleanup. Including small cards that affirm donors\u2019 identity as Red Cross supporters is an effective strategy, whereas including gift items such as address labels is not. Finally, very recent acquisitions are more likely to respond to appeals that ask them to contribute an amount similar to their most recent donation, but this approach has an adverse effect on donors with a longer history. We show via simulation that a simple design strategy based on these insights has potential to improve success rates from 5.4% to 8.1%.

Moreover, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents, the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets.

Before demand realizes, the firm faces a newsvendor problem for the two products with economies of scale in production for each. When consumers are responsive to others\u2019 decisions, social influence amplifies demand uncertainty, leading to a lower profit for the firm. We propose three solutions for the firm to better cope with or even benefit from social influence: influencer recruitment and a reduced product assortment either before demand realization (ex ante) or under production postponement (ex post). First, the firm can offer promotional incentives to recruit consumers as influencers. We reveal an operational benefit of influencer marketing that a very small fraction of such influencers is sufficient to diminish sales\u2019 unpredictability. Second, as the potential substitutability between products increases due to social influence, the firm may leverage the increased substitutability and enjoy lower cost in production by reducing product assortment before demand realization. Last, under production postponement, the firm can take advantage of the way that social influence results in demand herding and reduce product varieties by reacting to preorder information.

Because electricity prices can be negative, it is unclear how the presence of negative prices might affect the storage policy structure known to be optimal when prices are only nonnegative, or even how important it is to consider negative prices when managing an industrial battery. For fast storage (a storage facility that can both be fully emptied and filled up in one decision period), we show analytically that negative prices can substantially alter the optimal storage policy structure, e.g., all else being equal, it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage facility and fill up an almost full one. For more typical slow grid-level electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring negative prices could result in a considerable loss of value when negative prices occur more than 5% of the time. Negative prices raise another possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e.g., using load banks. We find that the value of such a disposal strategy is substantial, e.g., about $118 per kilowatt-year when negative prices occur 10% of the time, but smaller than that of the storage strategy, e.g., about $391 per kilowatt-year using a typical battery. However, devices for disposal are much cheaper than those for storage. Our results thus have ramifications for merchants as well as policy makers.

One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games. Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general. Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced in other settings.

Many EPR implementations are collective\u2014a large collection and recycling network (CRN) handles multiple producers\u2019 products in order to benefit from scale and scope economies. The total cost is then allocated to producers based on metrics such as their return shares by weight. Such weight-based proportional allocation mechanisms are criticized in practice for not taking into account the heterogeneity in the costs imposed by different producers\u2019 products. The consequence is cost allocations that impose higher costs on certain producer groups than they can achieve independently. This may lead some producers to break away from collective systems, resulting in fragmented systems with higher total cost. Yet cost efficiency is a key legislative and producer concern. To address this concern, this paper develops cost allocation mechanisms that induce participation in collective systems and maximize cost efficiency. The cost allocation mechanisms we propose consist of adjustments to the widely used return share method and include the weighing of return shares based on processing costs and the rewarding of capacity contributions to collective systems. We validate our theoretical results using Washington state EPR implementation data and provide insights into how these mechanisms can be implemented in practice.

Theory and Evidence from U.S. State Governments","Given the recent concern on \u201cbig governments\u201d and rising budget deficits in the United States and European nations, there has been a fundamental economic debate on the proper boundary and role of governments in a society. Inspired by this debate, we study the relationship between information technology (IT) and government size. Drawing on a broad range of the literature from multiple disciplines such as information systems, industrial organization, and political sciences, we present several theoretical mechanisms that explain the impact of IT on government expenditures. Using a variety of data on IT spending and state government expenditures, we find that greater IT investments made by a state chief information officer (CIO) are associated with lower state government spending. It is estimated that on average, a $1 increase in state CIO budgets is associated with a reduction of as much as $3.49 in state overall expenditures. This study contributes to the literature by identifying a key technological factor that affects government spending and showing that IT investments can be a means to restrain government growth.

Two competing stories can explain this phenomenon. One is that high-IQ consumers benefit less from costly services, as they find it easier to make informed financial decisions without external help. The alternative story is that these investors are less likely to overpay for the services they receive because they are either better judges of value or more capable of discerning the price charged for these services. A comprehensive data set of Finnish males\u2019 fund holdings supports both stories: consistent with the first story, high-IQ investors tend to avoid funds sold via expensive service-intensive channels and prefer a mix of equity and bond funds to expensive readily packaged balanced funds.

Three mechanisms have garnered the majority of this attention: formal contracts, relational contracts, and relationally embedded social ties. Although each mechanism has its virtues, all three exhibit a common limitation: an inability to fully explain the continuation and stability of intertemporal exchange between individuals and organizations in the face of change. Drawing on extensive quantitative data on approximately 450,000 microfinance loans made by a microfinance institution in Mexico from 2004 to 2008 that include random assignment of loan officers, this research proposes the concept of \u201drelational styles\u201d to help explain how repeated exchange is possible in the face of personnel change. We define relational styles as systematically reoccurring patterns of interaction employed by social actors within and across exchange relationships\u2014in this paper, between microfinance clients and loan officers. We show that relational styles that are consistent facilitate a clear understanding of expectations and thus exchange. We also demonstrate that consistency in the relational styles followed by successive loan officers mitigates the negative impact of a broken loan officer\u2013client tie. This paper thus proposes and empirically tests a social mechanism based on relational styles that often accompanies relational embeddedness, but which may also serve as a partial substitute for it.

To break this cycle, we investigate the impact of work design factors on responses to operational failures. We use hospital nurses as subjects in a laboratory experiment, where, unknown to them, two medication administration supplies are missing. We observe their real-time responses to the two failures and whether they contribute an improvement idea. We randomly assign half of the participants to an experiment location far away from a satellite pharmacy where the missing supplies can be obtained (\u201cdifficult condition\u201d), and the other half are located near the satellite pharmacy (\u201ceasy condition\u201d). Both conditions contain risky, against-policy supplies that can be used to complete the work tasks, giving participants a choice between policy-compliant workarounds and risky, against-policy workarounds. In the first study, we find that participants in the difficult condition are more likely to contribute improvement ideas but are less likely to use policy-compliant workarounds. A second experiment with a 2 \u00d7 2 design shows that participants in the difficult condition who have high access to the process owner are more likely to use policy-compliant workarounds than when they have low access. Our results suggest that hospitals can increase communication about operational failures by deliberately making it difficult to work around them while simultaneously providing a high level of access to process owners. Otherwise, nurses encountering operational failures are likely to resort to against-policy workarounds, a behavior observed in practice.

More recently (in Italy mainly during the last decade), many countries liberalized the service provision of public transportation. Although offering local public transportation is a political and financial duty of governments, the service provision is outsourced to a private operator, while the government retains a control position, given to a regulatory agency. This is a common scheme not only in transportation. In close collaboration with the public transportation agency of the city of Bologna, Italy, we designed a methodology to optimize some aspects of the contractual relationship between that agency and the bus operator. We focus on the fines specified by the contract when the operator fails to comply with the service level it has agreed to provide, and on a procedure to measure that service level. Our approach has the advantage that it aligns the incentives of both parties to the benefit of bus riders. We model the agency\u2013operator relationship as a multistage game and find its equilibrium to establish the best operating regime. The game-theoretical approach provides expressions for the fines that the operator should be charged if it does not satisfy the contracted services, and for the optimal agency\u2019s budget to devote to control activities. Second, to check the compliance of the operator with the schedule specified by the contract in a resource-efficient way, we compute how to position the agency\u2019s employees to verify if buses are running according to the specifications of the contract. This is achieved by counting bus services and by checking other quality indicators. We formulate this NP-hard problem as a mixed integer linear program and propose an algorithm to solve it that is effective in providing itineraries for the controllers working for the agency.

Specifically, we find that gift exchange contracts without shocks encourage effort and wages well above standard predictions. However, the introduction of random shocks reduces wages and effort, regardless of whether the shocks can be observed by the principal. Moreover, the introduction of shocks significantly reduces the probability of fulfilling the contract by the agent, the payoff of the principal, and total welfare.

The existing robust formulations obtained by applying well-known robust optimization methodologies become computationally intractable for large problem instances due to the presence of binary variables. This study resolves this intractability issue by proposing a new robust formulation that is shown to be solvable in polynomial time when the initial inventory is zero or negative. Because of the computational efficiency of the new robust formulation, it is implemented on a folding-horizon basis, leading to a new heuristic for the problem. The computational results reveal that the new heuristic is not only superior to the other formulations regarding the computing time needed, but also outperforms the existing robust formulations in terms of the actual cost savings on the larger instances. They also show that the actual cost savings yielded by the new heuristic are close to a lower bound on the optimal expected cost.

We characterize the optimal dynamic schedule in a simplified setting that incorporates stochastic break durations and advertisement lengths of 15 and 30 seconds. The optimal policy is a \u201cgreedy\u201d look-ahead rule that accounts for the remaining number of breaks; in this setting, there is no value to perfect information at the scheduling stage, and hence knowing the duration of all breaks would not change the schedule. We present heuristics to help solve scheduling problems of even greater complexity. The performance of these heuristics under various scenarios is tested by running simulations calibrated using industry data. The simple greedy heuristic is shown to perform well except when revenues are concave in ad length, in which case the look-ahead aspect of the optimal schedule becomes more important.

Their purpose is to improve efficiency and quality of care through enhanced sharing of patient data. Across the United States, numerous states have enacted laws that provide various forms of incentives for HIEs and address growing privacy concerns associated with the sharing of patient data. We investigate the impact on the emergence of HIEs of state laws that incentivize HIE efforts and state laws that include different types of privacy requirements for sharing healthcare data, focusing on the impact of laws that include requirements for patient consent. Although we observe that privacy regulation alone can result in a decrease in planning and operational HIEs, we also find that, when coupled with incentives, privacy regulation with requirements for patient consent can actually positively impact the development of HIE efforts. Among all states with laws creating HIE incentives, only states that combined incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational HIEs; HIEs in those states also reported decreased levels of privacy concern relative to HIEs in states with other legislative approaches. Our results contribute to the burgeoning literature on health information technology and the debate on the impact of privacy regulation on technology innovation. In particular, they show that the impact of privacy regulation on the success of information technology efforts is heterogeneous: both positive and negative effects can arise from regulation, depending on the specific attributes of privacy laws.

Broadly speaking, three main forces in the milk supply chain lead to the low quality of milk: high testing costs, harmful competition among stations, and free-riding among farmers. The goal of this study is to provide recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing. Interestingly, some intuitive interventions\u2014such as providing stations with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities) or subsidizing testing costs\u2014could hurt the quality of milk in the presence of competition. To save testing costs we utilize mixed testing, where the milk combined from multiple farmers is tested once. However, mixed testing makes the system vulnerable to free-riding among farmers. We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station conducts only one mixed test and no further testing.

We find that memory decay favors positioning the highest service level near the end, whereas acclimation favors maximizing the gradient of service level. Together, they maximize the gradient of service level near the end. Although memory decay and acclimation lead to the same design individually, they can act as opposing forces when considered jointly. Overall, our analysis suggests that short experiences should have activities scheduled as a crescendo and duration allocated primarily to the activities with the highest service levels, whereas long experiences should have activities scheduled in a U-shaped fashion and duration allocated primarily to activities with the lowest service level so as to ensure a steep gradient at the end.

Government subsidies offered directly to consumers impact the supplier\u2019s production and pricing decisions. Our analysis expands the current understanding of the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired adoption target level. From a coordination perspective, we demonstrate that the decentralized decisions are also optimal for a central planner managing jointly the supplier and the government. As a result, subsidies provide a coordination mechanism.

Strategic Supplier Alliances Under Order Default Risk","We study the alliance formation strategy among suppliers in a framework with one downstream firm and n upstream suppliers. Each supplier faces an exogenous random shock that may result in an order default. Each of them also has access to a recourse fund that can mitigate this risk. The suppliers can share the fund resources within an alliance, but they need to equitably allocate the profits of the alliance among the partners. In this context, suppliers need to decide whether to join larger alliances that have better chances of order fulfillment or smaller ones that may grant them higher profit allocations. We first analytically characterize the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation, rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers\u2019 investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their coalition formation strategy. Last, we discuss model generalizations and show that, in general, our insights are quite robust.

Although the prevailing view in the literature is that these accruals are caused by opportunistic misreporting, we show that these accruals do not appear to benefit managers and instead result from the normal economic activity of newly public companies. In particular, and in contrast to the notion that managers benefit from inflating accruals through an inflated issue price, inflated post-IPO equity values, and increased insider trading profits, we find no evidence of a relation between abnormal accruals and these outcomes. Instead, consistent with these accruals resulting from normal economic activity, we find that these accruals are attributable to the investment of IPO proceeds in working capital and that controlling for the amount of IPO proceeds invested in working capital produces a more powerful accrual-based measure of misreporting.

Although the proportion of women who ever had a mammogram is increasing, a majority of women do not get repeat mammograms. This paper analyzes the role of heterogeneity in women\u2019s adherence on optimal mammography screening recommendations. We develop a dynamic modeling framework that considers imperfect and heterogeneous adherence to screening recommendations. We carefully calibrate our model and solve it using real data. Unlike the existing breast cancer screening guidelines, our results suggest that adherence and heterogeneity in women\u2019s adherence behaviors should be explicitly considered. In particular, we find that when screening strategies are optimized assuming average adherence for everyone, the effect on patients with already low adherence would be relatively small, but patients with high adherence would be adversely affected. Considering imperfect and heterogeneous adherence in the population, our model suggests (1) given the current low adherence rates, an aggressive screening policy such as annual screening between the ages of 40 and 79 should be promoted to the general population; (2) screening strategies may be adjusted in clinical practice based on women\u2019s adherence, and screening intervals can be extended to two years for women with a history of high adherence; and (3) if the screening patterns change in the long run and most regular screeners adopt the most recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, then improving overall mammography adherence in society becomes more critical.

However, configuring and maintaining these systems can be highly complex, making it challenging to achieve high reliability. Resource-constrained software teams facing business pressures can be tempted to take design shortcuts in order to deliver business functionality more quickly. These design shortcuts and other maintenance activities contribute to the accumulation of technical debt, that is, a buildup of software maintenance obligations that need to be addressed in the future. We model and empirically analyze the impact of technical debt on system reliability by utilizing a longitudinal data set spanning the 10-year life cycle of a commercial enterprise system deployed at 48 different client firms. We use a competing risks analysis approach to discern the interdependency between client and vendor maintenance activities. This allows us to assess the effect of both problematic client modifications (client errors) and software errors present in the vendor-supplied platform (vendor errors) on system failures. We also examine the relative effects of modular and architectural maintenance activities undertaken by clients in order to analyze the dynamics of technical debt reduction. The results of our analysis first establish that technical debt decreases the reliability of enterprise systems. Second, modular maintenance targeted to reduce technical debt was approximately 53% more effective than architectural maintenance in reducing the probability of a system failure due to client errors, but it had the side effect of increasing the chance of a system failure due to vendor errors by approximately 83% more than did architectural maintenance activities. Using our empirical results we illustrate how firms could evaluate their business risk exposure due to technical debt accumulation in their enterprise systems, and we assess the estimated net effects, both positive and negative, of a range of software maintenance practices. Finally, we discuss implications for research in measuring and managing technical debt in enterprise systems.

In this work, we develop models to predict the outcomes of clinical trials testing combination chemotherapy regimens before they are run and to select the combination chemotherapy regimens to be tested in new phase II and phase III clinical trials, with the primary objective of improving the quality of regimens tested in phase III trials compared to current practice. We built a database of 414 clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer and use it to build statistical models that attain an out-of-sample R2 of 0.56 when predicting a trial\u2019s median overall survival (OS) and an out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 when predicting if a trial has unacceptably high toxicity. We propose models that use machine learning and optimization to suggest regimens to be tested in phase II and phase III trials. Though it is inherently challenging to evaluate the performance of such models without actually running clinical trials, we use two techniques to obtain estimates for the quality of regimens selected by our models compared with those actually tested in current clinical practice. Both techniques indicate that the models might improve the efficacy of the regimens selected for testing in phase III clinical trials without changing toxicity outcomes.

Diversity, on the one hand, facilitates the access to and integration of a wide variety of information; on the other hand, it may cause conflict and hurt group performance. Although diversity\u2019s effects have been the subject of many studies in offline work groups (with the results remaining inconclusive), its effects in online self-organizing groups are underexplored. In this paper, we examine 648 WikiProjects to understand (1) how tenure disparity and interest variety affect group productivity and member withdrawal and (2) how the two types of diversity evolve over time. Our results show a curvilinear effect of tenure disparity, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal, up to a point. Beyond that point, productivity slightly decreases, and members are more likely to withdraw. In comparison, our results show a positive effect of interest variety on productivity and no significant effects on withdrawal. We also find that, over a project\u2019s life cycle, tenure disparity decreases and interest variety increases, with both converging toward the level that is optimal for group performance. Overall, our study highlights the importance of having diverse experiences and perspectives in online open collaboration and the power of self-organizing that helps groups evolve toward their high-performing zones.

This suggests that a supplier should be indifferent between the two contracts. However, the sequence and magnitude of costs and revenues (i.e., losses and gains) vary significantly between the contracts, suggesting the supplier\u2019s preference of contract type, and associated contract parameter values, may vary with the level of loss aversion. We investigate this phenomenon through two studies. The first is a preliminary study investigating whether human suppliers are indeed indifferent between these two contracts. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, with human subjects taking on the role of the supplier having to choose between contracts, we find that contract preferences change with the ratio of overage and underage costs for the channel (i.e., the newsvendor critical ratio). In particular, a buyback contract is preferred for products with low critical ratio, whereas revenue sharing is preferred for products with high critical ratio. We show these results are consistent with the behavioral tendency of loss aversion and are more significant for subjects who exhibit higher loss aversion tendencies in an out of context task. In the second (main) study, we examine differences in the performance of buyback and revenue-sharing contracts when suppliers have the authority to set contract parameters. We find that the contract frame influences the way parameters are set and the critical ratio again plays an important role. More specifically, revenue-sharing contracts are more profitable for the supplier than buyback contracts in a high critical ratio environment when accounting for the supplier\u2019s parameter-specification behavior. Also, there is little difference in performance between the two contracts in a low critical ratio environment. These results can help inform supply managers on what types of contracts to use in different critical ratio settings.

Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk.

At any moment, the firm decides whether to release a new version of the product that captures the current technology level at the expense of a fixed launch cost. Consumers are forward-looking and purchase newer models only when it maximizes their own future discounted surpluses. We start by assuming that consumers have a common valuation for the product and consider two product launch settings. In the first setting, the firm does not announce future release technologies and the equilibrium of the game is to release new versions cyclically with a constant level of technology improvement that is optimal for the firm. In the second setting, the firm is able to precommit to a schedule of technology releases and the optimal policy generally consists of alternating minor and major technology launch cycles. We verify that the difference in profits between the commitment and no-commitment scenarios can be significant, varying from 4% to 12%. Finally, we generalize our model to allow for multiple customer classes with different valuations for the product, demonstrating how to compute equilibria in this case and numerically deriving insights for different market compositions.

This paper explores the benefit of risk pooling in the context of inventory management using the canonical model first studied in Eppen [Eppen GD (1979) Effects of centralization on expected costs in a multi-location newsboy problem. Management Sci. 25(5):498\u2013501]. Specifically, we consider a single-period, multilocation newsvendor model, where n different locations face independent and identically distributed demands and linear holding and backorder costs. We show that Eppen\u2019s celebrated result, i.e., that the expected cost savings from centralized inventory management scale with the square root of the number of locations, depends critically on the \u201clight-tailed\u201d nature of the demand uncertainty. In particular, we establish that the benefit from pooling relative to the decentralized case, in terms of both expected cost and safety stock, is equal to n(\u03b1\u20131)/\u03b1 for a class of heavy-tailed demand distributions (stable distributions), whose power-law asymptotic decay rate is determined by the parameter \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2). Thus, the benefit from pooling under heavy-tailed demand uncertainty can be significantly lower than \u221a\ud835\udc5bn, which is predicted for normally distributed demands. We discuss the implications of this result on the performance of periodic-review policies in multiperiod inventory management, as well as for the profits associated with drop-shipping fulfillment strategies. Corroborated by an extensive simulation analysis with heavy-tailed distributions that arise frequently in practice, such as power law and log normal, our findings highlight the importance of taking into account the shape of the tail of demand uncertainty when considering a risk pooling initiative.

We examine the impact of this \u201cmultipoint contact\u201d for mutual forbearance on two key dimensions of competition among security analysts: forecast accuracy and information leadership (issuing earnings forecasts or stock recommendations that influence rival analysts). We find that multipoint contact is associated with analysts exerting greater information leadership on stocks within their own spheres of influence. We also find greater forbearance related to information leadership under Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD). In contrast, multipoint contact was not associated with greater forecast accuracy on stocks within analysts\u2019 spheres of influence, either before or under Reg FD.

Comparing Crowds with Expert Evaluation in Funding the Arts","In fields as diverse as technology entrepreneurship and the arts, crowds of interested stakeholders are increasingly responsible for deciding which innovations to fund, a privilege that was previously reserved for a few experts, such as venture capitalists and grant-making bodies. Little is known about the degree to which the crowd differs from experts in judging which ideas to fund, and, indeed, whether the crowd is even rational in making funding decisions. Drawing on a panel of national experts and comprehensive data from the largest crowdfunding site, we examine funding decisions for proposed theater projects, a category where expert and crowd preferences might be expected to differ greatly. We instead find significant agreement between the funding decisions of crowds and experts. Where crowds and experts disagree, it is far more likely to be a case where the crowd is willing to fund projects that experts may not. Examining the outcomes of these projects, we find no quantitative or qualitative differences between projects funded by the crowd alone and those that were selected by both the crowd and experts. Our findings suggest that crowdfunding can play an important role in complementing expert decisions, particularly in sectors where the crowds are end users, by allowing projects the option to receive multiple evaluations and thereby lowering the incidence of \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2207","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['crowdfunding', 'stakeholders', 'funding decisions', 'expert evaluation']","The article discusses the role of crowds in funding decisions, which implies a shift towards inclusivity and democratization in the evaluation process.

This paper shows that when firms have a choice, asymmetric outcomes can arise, with some firms choosing to commit to a quantity and other firms choosing not to. To study the commitment decision, we analyze a multistage game within a duopoly of differentiated firms \u00e0 la Hotelling. In the first stage of the game, firms choose whether or not to commit to a quantity. In the second stage, each firm that chose to commit sets a quantity, which represents an upper bound on how much it can sell to consumers. In the third stage, both firms set prices strategically, regardless of whether or not they committed. In the final stage, demand is allocated as consumers maximize their utilities. Firm(s) that chose not to commit to a quantity in the first stage can fulfill any quantity that consumers demand at the equilibrium prices. We find that if product differentiation is sufficiently low, both firms choose to commit to a quantity in equilibrium. This symmetric equilibrium allows both firms to avoid the intense price competition associated with low product differentiation. If the level of differentiation is sufficiently high, the equilibrium in quantity commitment is asymmetric such that one firm chooses to commit and its competitor chooses not to commit. Under this equilibrium, a pricing equilibrium in pure strategies does not exist, only a pricing equilibrium in mixed strategies does, and the equilibrium prices can result in a committed firm not clearing the entire quantity it chose earlier.

In such markets, employers post tasks on which remote contractors work and deliver the product of their work online. As in most online marketplaces, reputation mechanisms play a very important role in facilitating transactions, since they instill trust and are often predictive of the employer\u2019s future satisfaction. However, labor markets are usually highly heterogeneous in terms of available task categories; in such scenarios, past performance may not be an accurate signal of future performance. To account for this natural heterogeneity, in this work, we build models that predict the performance of a worker based on prior, category-specific feedback. Our models assume that each worker has a category-specific quality, which is latent and not directly observable; what is observable, though, is the set of feedback ratings of the worker and of other contractors with similar work histories. Based on this information, we provide a series of models of increasing complexity that successfully estimate the worker\u2019s quality. We start by building a binomial model and a multinomial model under the implicit assumption that the latent qualities of the workers are static. Next, we remove this assumption, and we build linear dynamic systems that capture the evolution of these latent qualities over time. We evaluate our models on a large corpus of over a million transactions (completed tasks) from oDesk, an online labor market with hundreds of millions of dollars in transaction volume. Our results show an improved accuracy of up to 25% compared to feedback baselines and significant improvement over the commonly used collaborative filtering approach. Our study clearly illustrates that reputation systems should present different reputation scores, depending on the context in which the worker has been previously evaluated and the job for which the worker is applying.

Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise. These findings can enrich the understanding of these two contract forms and are useful for sales and operations planning.

Our results estimate a median willingness to pay for one year of a warranty of approximately $850, which is equivalent to 3.1% of the median vehicle price in our sample. We find that, for a car with median characteristics, the effect on consumer utility of a 1% price decrease is equivalent, all else being equal, to increasing product quality by 2.2%, and is in turn equivalent to increasing the warranty length by 8%. Our results also indicate that service attributes play a compensatory role with respect to product quality; i.e., the impact of warranty length and service quality on demand increases when product quality decreases. Conversely, both service metrics are complementary with respect to demand; i.e., the better the service quality, the higher the marginal effect of longer warranties. Our results thus imply that, in our period of analysis, warranties played a more important role for American firms than for foreign firms, consistent with the fact that American manufacturers exhibited lower product quality and higher service quality than non-American firms.

Often these problems can be modeled by a maximum weight matching problem in (bipartite) graphs or generalizations thereof, and efficient and practical algorithms are known for these problems. Although in some of the applications an assignment of the resources may be needed only once, in many of these applications, the assignment has to be computed more often for different scenarios. In that case it is often essential that the assignments can be computed very fast. Moreover, implementing different assignments in different scenarios may come with a certain cost for the reconfiguration of the system. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining optimal assignments sequentially over a given time horizon, where consecutive assignments are coupled by constraints that control the cost of reconfiguration. We develop fast approximation and online algorithms for this problem with provable approximation guarantees and competitive ratios. Moreover, we present an extensive computational study about the applicability of our model and our algorithms in the context of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks, finding a significant performance improvement for the total bandwidth of the system using our algorithms. For this application (the downlink of an OFDMA wireless cell) , the run time of matching algorithms is extremely important, having an acceptable range of a few milliseconds only. For the considered realistic instances, our algorithms perform extremely well: the solution quality is, on average, within a factor of 0.8\u20130.9 of optimal off-line solutions, and the running times are at most 5 ms per phase even in the worst case. Thus, our algorithms are well suited to be applied in the context of OFDMA systems. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2221.

This paper applies the economic framework of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers\u2019 risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing models.

In four studies, we show that expertise affects younger consumers, such that younger novices evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature benefit information, whereas younger experts evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature attribute information. However, both older novices and experts evaluate products described with benefit information more favorably than those described with attribute information. We further show that differences in the perceived diagnosticity of different types of information mediate the effects of expertise and age on product evaluations. We theorize that age differences in perceived diagnosticity occur because older and younger consumers spontaneously construe information in different ways. Therefore, age differences in the effect of expertise on evaluations should disappear when construal levels are controlled. Consistent with our hypotheses, we demonstrate that when primed to construe information at concrete levels, older consumers behave just like younger consumers\u2014older experts formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with attribute information, but older novices formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with benefit information.

Our main finding is that a moderate compensation to the leader is beneficial; it increases the average contribution relative to both a situation where the leader is not compensated and a situation without a leader.

In the short run, however, it is notoriously volatile. Moreover, its computation requires precise knowledge of the asset return distribution, which is not directly observable but must be inferred from sparse data. By using methods from distributionally robust optimization, we design fixed-mix strategies that offer similar performance guarantees as the growth-optimal portfolio but for a finite investment horizon and for a whole family of distributions that share the same first- and second-order moments. We demonstrate that the resulting robust growth-optimal portfolios can be computed efficiently by solving a tractable conic program whose size is independent of the length of the investment horizon.

Typically, when customers arrive to such systems, they seem identical or homogeneous; however, from the system\u2019s perspective, as they wait in the queue, their residual willingness to wait changes. For instance, a customer who has already waited for 10 minutes may have a different residual willingness to wait compared with a customer who has only waited for 1 minute. In this manner, as time progresses, customers become differentiated on their estimated patience levels. We exploit this dimension of customer heterogeneity to construct scheduling policies in overloaded systems that dynamically prioritize customers based on their time in queue to optimize any given system performance metric.

Three features of online social communication are represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status- or image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model, agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the entry of senders.

We consider both additive and multiplicative demand forms. This problem is, in general, intractable due to its computational complexity. We develop a simple heuristic that resolves this issue. The heuristic involves a myopic pricing policy that generates each period\u2019s price as a function of the initial inventory level and a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. In each period, the firm monitors its so-called price-deflated inventory position and places an order to reach a target base-stock level. The price-deflated inventory position weights the on-hand and pipeline inventory according to a factor that reflects the sensitivity of price to the net inventory level. To assess the effectiveness of our heuristic, we construct an upper bound to the exact system. The upper bound is based on an information-relaxation approach and involves a penalty function derived from the proposed heuristic. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is near-optimal. The heuristic approach can be applied to a wide variety of inventory systems, such as systems with fixed ordering costs or fixed batch sizes. The heuristic enables us to explore the use of price as a lever to balance supply and demand. Our findings indicate that a responsive strategy (that effectively reduces the replenishment lead time) leads to a more stable pricing policy and that the value of dynamic pricing increases with lead time.

Channel Structures in Electronic Retailing","In recent years, online retailers (also called e-tailers) have started allowing manufacturers direct access to their customers while charging a fee for providing this access, a format commonly referred to as agency selling. In this paper, we use a stylized theoretical model to answer a key question that e-tailers are facing: When should they use an agency selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format? We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads to lower retail prices; however, the e-tailers end up giving control over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the manufacturer, who makes electronic channel pricing decisions based on their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar retailing), is an important factor for e-tailers to consider. We find that when sales in the electronic channel lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling, whereas when sales in the electronic channel lead to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between e-tailers\u2014as competition between them increases, e-tailers prefer to use agency selling. We also find that when e-tailers benefit from positive externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower under reselling than under agency selling, and the e-tailers prefer reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency selling without the positive externalities.

Shifting to more complex work often reduces the importance of a single individual\u2019s knowledge for the firm\u2019s exchange relationships because complex work requires inputs from a broader set of the firm\u2019s members. Although complex work decreases the likelihood that a single individual can shift the exchange relationship to another firm, we propose that it increases the vulnerability of the firm\u2019s performance to departures of those individual managers who act as coordinators of knowledge. This leads us to focus on how the internal knowledge network formed to maintain each relationship can compound or mitigate the loss of a coordinating manager. Using original data on client relationships from a law firm, we examine the effect of internal knowledge networks and lead partner departures on the performance of the relationships. Supporting our argument, we find that the negative performance effect of a lead partner departure is greater when the network has high knowledge heterogeneity and involves more experts and lower when the network has high cohesion.

We examine how the entry of platforms for the solicitation of casual sex influences the incidence rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using a census of 12 million patients subjected to a natural experiment in Florida, we find a significant increase in HIV incidence after platform implementation, with the largest effect accruing to historically at-risk populations (i.e., African Americans) despite documented lower rates of Internet utilization. Strikingly, our analysis reveals that HIV incidence increases in historically low-risk populations as well (e.g., individuals of higher socioeconomic status) and that men and women experience similar penalties. Identifying granular effects across subpopulations allows us to offer additional insight into the mechanisms by which matching platforms increase HIV incidence.

We explore how the addition of partial information affects these types of choices using theoretical and empirical methods. Our experiments in both gain and loss domains demonstrate that when such information supports a favorable outcome, it strongly increases valuation of an ambiguous financial prospect. However, when information supports an unfavorable outcome, it has significantly less impact. We find that two mechanisms drive this asymmetry. First, unfavorable information decreases estimates of a good outcome occurring but also reduces aversive uncertainty. These factors act in opposition, minimizing the effects of unfavorable information. Second, when information can be subjectively interpreted, unfavorable information is less likely to be integrated into evaluations. Our findings reveal mechanisms not captured by traditional models of decision making under uncertainty and highlight the importance of increasing the salience of unfavorable information in uncertain contexts to promote unbiased decision making.

Bursts of volatility are often incorrectly identified as jumps when the sampling is too sparse. At a higher frequency, methods robust to microstructure noise are required. We argue that whatever the jump detection test and the sampling frequency, a large number of spurious detections remain because of multiple testing issues. We propose a formal treatment based on an explicit thresholding on available test statistics. We prove that our method eliminates asymptotically all remaining spurious detections. In Dow Jones stocks between 2006 and 2008, spurious detections can represent up to 90% of the jumps detected initially. For the stocks considered, jumps are rare events, they do not cluster in time, and no cojump affects all stocks simultaneously, suggesting jump risk is diversifiable. We relate the remaining jumps to macroeconomic news, prescheduled company-specific announcements, and stories from news agencies that include a variety of unscheduled and uncategorized events. The vast majority of news does not cause jumps but may generate a market reaction in the form of bursts of volatility.

The distinctive feature of our model is that the ranking of customer preferences depends on lead times: patient customers are willing to pay more than impatient customers for long lead times, and vice versa for speedier service. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the capacity, the market size, and the properties of the valuation-delay cost distribution, for three features of the optimal menu and segmentation: pricing out the middle of the delay cost spectrum while serving both ends, pooling types with different delay costs into a single class, and  strategic delay to deliberately inflate lead times.

Despite the potential benefits of dynamic pricing, many sellers still adopt a static pricing policy because of (1) the complexity of frequent reoptimizations, (2) the negative perception of excessive price adjustments, and (3) the lack of flexibility caused by existing business constraints. In this paper, we develop a family of pricing heuristics that can be used to address all these challenges. Our heuristic is computationally easy to implement; it requires only a single optimization at the beginning of the selling season and automatically adjusts the prices over time. Moreover, to guarantee a strong revenue performance, the heuristic only needs to adjust the prices of a small number of products and do so infrequently. This property helps the seller focus his effort on the prices of the most important products instead of all products. In addition, in the case where not all products are equally admissible to price adjustment (due to existing business constraints such as contractual agreement, strategic product positioning, etc.), our heuristic can immediately substitute the price adjustment of the original products with the price adjustment of similar products and maintain an equivalent revenue performance. This property provides the seller with extra flexibility in managing his prices.

For instance, in September 2013, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into full effect. The accompanying transparency requirements have prompted physician practices and hospitals to severely restrict pharmaceutical sales representatives\u2019 direct access to their physicians. Despite all the attention in the popular press, scant scholarly research has investigated how these restrictions on physician access impact physician prescription behavior and competitive detailing to physicians. To analyze the impact of these restrictions, we develop a structural model of how pharmaceutical firms compete dynamically to schedule detailing to physicians. Detailing activities are known to have significant carryover effects that are captured in a first-stage model of physicians\u2019 demand for prescription drugs. We also specify detailing policy functions that describe each firm\u2019s observed detailing actions. In a second stage, we estimate a model that describes costs of detailing, assuming that the observed detailing levels are consistent with a Markov perfect Nash equilibrium. The estimated structural model is used to examine the implications of restrictions on the amount of detailing via counterfactual simulations. We find that restriction policies would increase the market share of a nondrug-treatment-only option but impact firms asymmetrically; firms that are strong in detailing and/or rely more on detailing would be hurt more. Unexpectedly, a policy that imposes a ceiling on detailing frequency could significantly reduce detailing of all firms in the market, including those firms with average detailing levels below the ceiling, and effectively would soften competition between firms and enhance their profits.

By combining data from a lab experiment conducted with a fairly representative sample of adolescents in Norway and high-quality register data on family background, we show that family background is fundamental in two important ways. First, boys from low socioeconomic status families are less willing to compete than boys from better-off families, even when controlling for confidence, performance, risk preferences, time preferences, social preferences, and psychological traits. Second, family background is crucial for understanding the large gender difference in the willingness to compete. Girls are much less willing to compete than boys among children from better-off families, whereas we do not find any gender difference in willingness to compete among children from low socioeconomic status families. Our data suggest that the main explanation of the role of family background is that the father\u2019s socioeconomic status is strongly associated with boys\u2019 willingness to compete.

Competitively priced bank loans are available, and the failure of loan repayment leads to bankruptcy, where default costs may include variable (proportional to the firm\u2019s sales) and fixed costs. Without default costs, it is known that simple contracts (e.g., revenue-sharing, buyback, and quantity discount) can coordinate and allocate profits arbitrarily in the chain. With only variable default costs, buyback contracts remain coordinating and equivalent to revenue-sharing contracts but are Pareto dominated by revenue-sharing contracts when fixed default costs are present. Thus, for general bankruptcy costs, contracts without buyback terms are of most interest. Quantity discount contracts fail to coordinate the supply chain, since a necessary condition for coordination is to proportionally reallocate debt obligations within the channel. With only variable default costs and with high fixed default costs exhibiting substantial economies-of-scale, revenue-sharing contracts with working capital coordination continue to coordinate the chain. Unexpectedly, for fixed default costs with small economies-of-scale effects, the two-firm system under a revenue-sharing contract with working capital coordination might have higher expected profit than the one-firm system. Our results provide support for the use of revenue-sharing contracts with working capital coordination for decentralized management of supply chains when there are bankruptcy risks and default costs.

We do so by using an extensive, hand-collected data set that captures the supply chain relationships of bankrupt firms over the time period 1990\u20132009. Looking at a sample of more than 2,000 loan contracts, we compare the average borrowing cost of suppliers in the two years prior to the bankruptcy of a key customer to the average cost in the two years following the announced bankruptcy. We find the average loan spreads increase by roughly 20% following the customer\u2019s announced bankruptcy. These effects are even stronger if the bankrupt firm is operating within a distressed industry or when there is a strong supplier\u2013customer relationship. We also find that the structure of lending agreements significantly changes in the aftermath of a client bankruptcy. More specifically, we find that the number of covenants increases and the lead banker(s) take an increasingly important role in the period following the client\u2019s bankruptcy. Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into the financial implications of supply chain changes.

The cash-flow news returns associated with investment-sorted portfolios exhibit a reversal from the preformation period to the postformation period.

Aggregators provide titles and short summaries (snippets) of articles they link to. Content producers claim that their presence deprives them of traffic that would otherwise flow to their sites. In light of this controversy, we conduct a series of field experiments whose objective is to provide insight with respect to how readers allocate their attention between a news aggregator and the original articles it links to. Our experiments are based on manipulating elements of the user interface of a Swiss mobile news aggregator. We examine how key design parameters, such as the length of the text snippet that an aggregator displays about articles, the presence of associated images, and the number of related articles on the same story, affect a reader\u2019s propensity to visit the content producer\u2019s site and read the full article. Our findings suggest the presence of a substitution relationship between the amount of information that aggregators offer about articles and the probability that readers will opt to read the full articles at the content producer sites. Interestingly, however, when several related article outlines compete for user attention, a longer snippet and the inclusion of an image increase the probability that an article will be chosen over its competitors.

We first assess the validity of PIN as a measure of informed trading by calculating its association with measures of the adverse-selection component of the cost of trading. We then provide new evidence that PIN_G and PIN_B capture informed trading around earnings announcements by showing that they predict positive and negative earnings surprises, respectively. Conjecturing that investors who take long positions will be more concerned about informed selling than about informed buying since the former depresses the sale price whereas the latter raises it, we then investigate asymmetry in the pricing of private information.

We hypothesize that the use of debt alleviates the conflict between shareholder classes by balancing the power of controlling insiders. We document that dual class firms have higher leverage and a greater propensity to issue private debt; they also more frequently use cash sweeps and performance-based covenants. Dual class firms with greater agency conflicts and a greater need to access the capital market appear to rely more extensively on debt. These findings are consistent with controlling insiders bonding against the agency costs associated with dual class ownership. The governance role of debt is further corroborated by the valuation effect of debt for dual class companies. Private debt issuances trigger greater positive market reactions to the inferior dual class stock in relation to both the superior dual class stock and a matched sample of single class firms. Further, leverage attenuates the previously documented adverse effect of dual class status on Tobin\u2019s q.

A segment of the consumer population, called socially conscious, is willing to pay a higher price for a product sourced from a responsible supplier and may not purchase in the event of a responsibility violation from a risky supplier. We identify four possible sourcing strategies that a buyer might employ: low cost sourcing (sourcing from the risky supplier), dual sourcing, responsible niche sourcing (sourcing from a responsible supplier and selling only to socially conscious consumers), and responsible mass market sourcing (sourcing responsibly and selling to all consumers). We determine when each strategy is optimal and show that efforts to improve supply chain responsibility that focus on consumers (by increasing their willingness to pay for responsibility or increasing the number of consumers that are socially conscious) or increasing supply chain transparency may lead to unintended consequences, such as an increase in risky sourcing. Efforts that focus on enforcement and penalizing the buyer, however, never backfire and always lead to more responsible sourcing and less risky sourcing.

However, in spite of the increasing prevalence of this information, there are relatively few academic studies that analyze the impact of peer ratings on consumers transacting in \u201creal-world\u201d marketplaces. In this paper, we partner with a major telecommunications company to analyze the impact of peer ratings in a real-world video-on-demand market where consumer participation is organic and where movies are costly and well known to consumers. After experimentally changing the initial conditions of product information displayed to consumers, we find that, consistent with the prior literature, peer ratings influence consumer behavior independently from underlying product quality. However, we also find that, in contrast to the prior literature, there is little evidence of long-term bias as a result of herding effects, at least in our setting. Specifically, when movies are artificially promoted or demoted in peer rating lists, subsequent reviews cause them to return to their true quality position relatively quickly. One explanation for this difference is that consumers in our empirical setting likely had more outside information about the true quality of the products they were evaluating than did consumers in the studies reported in prior literature. Although tentative, this explanation suggests that in real-world marketplaces where consumers have sufficient access to outside information about true product quality, peer ratings may be more robust to herding effects and thus provide more reliable signals of true product quality than previously thought.

For example, a retailer needs store-level forecasts to manage inventory at the store, but also requires a regionally aggregated forecast for managing inventory at a distribution center. In generating an aggregate forecast, a firm can choose to make the forecast directly based on the aggregated data or indirectly by summing lower-level forecasts (i.e., bottom up). Our study investigates the relative performance of such hierarchical forecasting processes through a behavioral lens. We identify two judgment biases that affect the relative performance of direct and indirect forecasting approaches: a propensity for random judgment errors and a failure to benefit from the informational value that is embedded in the correlation structure between lower-level demands. Based on these biases, we characterize demand environments where one hierarchical process results in more accurate forecasts than the other.

In recent years, many retailers have added exclusively sourced factory outlet stores into their channel mix to achieve market expansion and customer segmentation. However, the impact of adoption of this lower-quality, lower-price alternative channel on spending at the retailer\u2019s higher-quality, higher-price retail store channel is not clear. Customers adopting the outlet channel might increase their spending in the retail store channel because of the opportunity to become familiar with the brand at a lower price point or transfer of positive associations formed through patronage of the outlet channel to the store channel. Customers adopting the lower-quality channel might also decrease their spending in the retail store channel because of brand dilution or cannibalization. To investigate this issue, we use a unique individual-level panel data set from a specialty apparel retailer from a period during which the retailer opened many factory outlet stores. This allows us to study how purchase behavior changes after customers adopt the outlet channel while carefully controlling for alternative explanations including customer heterogeneity and selection effects. We find that although customers who adopt the outlet channel spend less with the retailer compared to store-only customers, the difference cannot be attributed to the impact of adoption of the outlet channel. After controlling for heterogeneity and selection effects, we uncover a positive spillover to the retail store channel from adoption of the outlet channel. Customers who adopt the outlet channel not only make incremental purchases at the outlet channel, but also increase their spending in the retail store channel after adoption. The increase in spending is due to more frequent retail store purchases and not to larger per-purchase expenditure. This paper was accepted by J.

Retailers sell billions of dollars of inventory annually during store liquidations. This paper introduces the store liquidation problem to the literature and presents a technique for optimizing key store liquidation decisions, including markdowns, inventory transfers, and the timing of store closings. We propose a heuristic for solving the store liquidation problem and evaluate the performance of this method. Through applications, we show that our approach could improve net recovery on cost (i.e., the profit obtained during a liquidation stated as a percentage of the cost value of liquidated inventory) by two to five percentage points in the cases we examined. Further, we discuss ways in which current practice in store liquidation differs from the decisions identified by our method, and we trace the consequences of these differences.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0531","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on optimizing store liquidation processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2016","18","1","German F.

We analyze the outcome of a field experiment executed by a major public cloud infrastructure services provider in 2011. Out of 2,673 customers who adopted the service during the experiment, 366 received a service intervention: an engagement through which the provider offered initial guidance on how to use basic features of the service. Before execution, it was unclear if this proactive customer education would have positive or negative effects on customer retention and demand for technology support. We show the treatment reduces by half the number of customers who churn from the service during the first week. Further, treated customers ask 19.55% fewer questions during the first week of their tenure than the controls. Although the treatment\u2019s effects decay within one week, we show that such proactive customer education can have significant economic benefits for the provider. In particular, we find that treated customers increase their accumulated usage of the service by 46.57% in the eight months after sign-up. Finally, we provide evidence that the effects of the treatment are strongest among customers who have less experience with the provider.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0547","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['customer education', 'customer retention', 'service intervention']","The article focuses primarily on customer education and retention from a technical and economic perspective, with no significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This process creates a \u201cbrowsing path\u201d along which there is potential for repeated interaction between the user and the provider, giving rise to a dynamic optimization problem. A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice. The documented improvement highlights the importance and the practicality of efficiently incorporating the future path of users in real time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0548","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization of content recommendation services with an emphasis on metrics like click-through rates and user engagement, lacking any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2016","18","1","Joonkyum LeeJoonkyum Leejklee@sogang.ac.krSogang Business School, Sogang University, Seoul 121-742, KoreaSearch for more papers by this author, Vishal GaurVishal Gaurvg77@cornell.eduJohnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853Search for more papers by this author, Suresh MuthulingamSuresh Muthulingamsuresh@psu.eduSmeal College of Business, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802Search for more papers by this author, Gary F.

Demand information is censored, the exact time of stockout is not observed, and the short selling season often does not allow for replenishment. Using data for 26,749 book titles from 2007 to 2011 and a simulation experiment calibrated on real data, we show that an attribute-based choice model generates accurate demand estimates (mean absolute percentage error less than 1%) even when nearly 90% of the textbooks in the fit sample experience stockout. This performance is driven by the heterogeneity of product attributes and is robust to the occurrence of product returns. We implement this model at the bookstore in a controlled field experiment and obtain over 10% increase in profit. The results show that accounting for asymmetric and stockout-based substitution in demand estimation and inventory planning enables us to make systematic corrections in inventory mix and inventory level compared to the existing process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0551","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory planning and demand estimation without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One of the retailer\u2019s main challenges is pricing and predicting demand for products that it has never sold before, which account for the majority of sales and revenue. To tackle this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to estimate historical lost sales and predict future demand of new products.

We develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the subsequent multiproduct price optimization that incorporates reference price effects, and we create and implement this algorithm into a pricing decision support tool for Rue La La\u2019s daily use. We conduct a field experiment and find that sales does not decrease because of implementing tool recommended price increases for medium and high price point products.

In such problems, a seller provides a variety of products for which customers can construct a personalized bundle and send a request for quote (RFQ) to the seller. The seller, after reviewing the RFQ, has to determine a price based on which the customer either purchases the whole bundle or nothing. Such problems are faced by many companies in practice, and they are very difficult because of the potential unlimited possible configurations of the bundle and the correlations among the individual products. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down and bottom-up approach to solve this problem. In the top-down step, we decompose the bundle into each component and calibrate a value score for each component. In the bottom-up step, we aggregate the components back to the bundle, define important features of the bundle, and segment different RFQs by those bundle features as well as customer attributes. Then we estimate a utility function for each segment based on historical sales data and derive an optimal price for each incoming RFQ. We show that such a model overcomes the aforementioned difficulties and can be implemented efficiently. We test our approach using empirical data from a major information technology service provider and the test result shows that the proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of pricing significantly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0563","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies for personalized product bundles without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This variability along with patient preferences driving scheduling decisions resulted in both low operating room (OR) utilization and significant overtime for surgical teams at Mayo Clinic. In this paper we discuss the development of an improved scheduling approach for spine surgeries over a rolling planning horizon. First, data mining and statistical analysis was performed using a large data set to identify categories of surgeries that could be grouped together based on surgical time distributions and could be categorized at the time of case scheduling. These surgical categories are then used in a hierarchical optimization approach with the objective of maximizing a weighted combination of OR utilization and net profit. The optimization model is explored to consider trade-offs and relationships among utilization levels, financial performance, overtime allowance, and case mix. The new scheduling approach was implemented via a custom Web-based application that allowed the surgeons and schedulers to interactively identify best surgical days with patients. A pilot implementation resulted in a utilization increase of 19% and a reduction in overtime by 10%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0564","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and optimization in orthopedic surgeries without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

How can buyers motivate suppliers to exert greater care to prevent such harm? This paper characterizes a \u201cbackfiring condition\u201d under which actions taken by prominent buyers (increasing auditing, publicizing negative audit reports, providing loans to suppliers) motivate a supplier to exert greater effort to pass the buyer\u2019s audit by hiding information and less care to prevent harm. Intuitively appealing actions for a buyer (penalizing a supplier for harming workers or the environment, or for trying to deceive an auditor) may be similarly counterproductive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, squeezing a supplier\u2019s margin (by reducing the price paid to the supplier or increasing wages for workers) motivates the supplier to exert greater care to prevent harm\u2014under the backfiring condition. Whereas the necessary and sufficient condition depends on the relative convexity of the supplier\u2019s hiding cost function, a simple sufficient condition is that the supplier is likely to successfully hide information from the auditor, in equilibrium. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the backfiring condition is prevalent or becoming increasingly so.

Yet, several firms avoid planned obsolescence and instead offer products with high durability. In this paper, we offer a demand-side rationale for a high-durability product design strategy: the exclusivity-seeking consumer behavior associated with conspicuous consumption. In the presence of consumers who value exclusivity, we find that firms benefit from designing products with higher durability in conjunction with a high-price, low-volume introduction strategy. A higher durability in such a context leads to greater resale value, allowing the firm to charge a higher price and lower the sales volume to achieve the product exclusivity valued by the consumers. This contrasts with the planned obsolescence strategy that capitalizes on the high sales volume achieved by setting a low new product price. We also show that offering higher durability and charging a higher price are complementary levers to respond to consumers who value exclusivity. Our analysis unearths insights regarding the effect of exclusivity-seeking behavior on a firm\u2019s demand and pricing. We show that firms\u2019 durability choice may explain the joint increase in price and demand for conspicuous goods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0554","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['planned obsolescence', 'durability', 'exclusivity']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of product durability and consumer behavior, with no significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

We model the environment as a partially endogenous process: the population\u2019s health can be improved by providing screening services, which reduces future demand for diagnostic services. We use event-based dynamic programming to build a framework for modeling different kinds of these facilities. This framework contains a number of service priority policies that are concerned with prioritizing screening versus diagnostic services. The main trade-off is between serving urgent diagnostic needs and providing screening services that may decrease future diagnostic needs. Under certain conditions, this trade-off reverses the famous c\u03bc rule; i.e., the patients with lower waiting cost are given priority over the others. We define appropriate event operators and specify the properties preserved by these operators.

The problem is to select steel coils from a set of waiting coils to form batches to be annealed in available batch annealing furnaces and choose a median coil for each furnace. The objective is to maximize the total reward of the selected coils less the total coil\u2013coil and coil\u2013furnace mismatching cost. For a special case of the problem that arises frequently in practical settings where the coils are all similar and there is only one type of furnace available, we develop a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. For the general case of the problem, which is strongly NP-hard, an exact branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm is developed using a column and row generation framework. A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm. The algorithm is capable of solving medium-size instances to optimality within a reasonable computation time. In addition, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for solving larger instances. Three simple search neighborhoods, as well as a sophisticated variable-depth neighborhood, are developed. This heuristic can generate near-optimal solutions for large instances within a short computation time. Using both randomly generated and real-world production data sets, we show that our algorithms are superior to the typical rule-based planning approach used by many steel plants.

It is known that, when quality is exogenous, encroachment could make the retailer better off. Yet, when quality is endogenous and the manufacturer has enough flexibility in adjusting quality, we find that encroachment always makes the retailer worse off in a large variety of scenarios. We also establish that, while a higher manufacturer\u2019s cost of quality hurts the retailer in absence of encroachment, it could benefit the retailer with encroachment. In addition, we show that a manufacturer offering differentiated products through two channels prefers to sell its high-quality product through the direct channel. Contrary to conventional wisdom, quality differentiation does not always benefit either manufacturer or retailer. Our results may explain why, despite extant theoretical predictions, retailers almost always resent encroachment. These findings also suggest that firms must be cautious when adopting quality differentiation as a strategy to ease channel conflict caused by encroachment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0562","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain dynamics and product quality without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We identify quantity and price responsiveness as two mediating mechanisms that distinguish how high and low inventory turnover retailers manage demand shocks. Using quarterly firm-level data of 183 U.S. retailers between 1985 and 2012, we find that HIT retailers are able to respond quickly by changing their purchase quantities in response to demand shocks, whereas LIT retailers primarily rely on price changes to manage demand shocks. In addition, we examine the differential implications of these mechanisms on the financial performance of HIT and LIT retailers. We find price responsiveness to be a less effective strategy, compared to quantity responsiveness, in reducing excesses and shortages of inventory. Finally, the negative financial impact of a given amount of excess and shortage of inventory is eight times more severe for LIT retailers compared to HIT retailers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0571","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and financial performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Lenient returns may induce higher full-price sales by limiting consumer regret, while signaling clearance unavailability risk. Contrasting earlier research that concluded a monopolist must set the refund at the clearance price when strategic consumers were overlooked, we find that an optimal refund bounded by the clearance price can mitigate purchase deferrals only when a monopolist salvages at mild discounts. To explore conditions under which a monopolist permits \u201cfull-refund returns,\u201d we consider three scenarios: we permit clearing inventory without a loss; we assume lenient returns stimulate aggregate demand; we consider consumers\u2019 transaction costs. We also derive a unique rational expectations equilibrium for competing retailers, wherein each retailer\u2019s equilibrium refund is nondecreasing in its clearance price. Furthermore, retailers with clearance prices below a threshold should not allow returns, and those who do, higher clearance revenues imply higher full prices, higher quantities, and higher profits. We conclude that a credible clearance partner salvaging at higher prices than those at competing clearance mediums helps retailers gain competitive advantage when selling to strategic consumers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0570","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online retail return policies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper is motivated by ones in which a supplier sells its primary product to a buyer that incurs an emissions cost (voluntarily, or due to government-imposed climate policy) and sells co-products into markets without emissions costs. Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier\u2019s emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost. In numerical examples, considering the rare earth cerium oxide (co-produced with iron) and palm oil (co-produced with palm meal), the choice of allocation rule has a large impact on emissions, a buyer\u2019s profit, and social welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0572","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['emissions', 'climate policy', 'social welfare']","The article discusses the implications of emissions allocation and climate policy, indicating a focus on environmental sustainability and social welfare.

The general premise behind these works is that such models may be used to help manage an ED that consistently faces high congestion. In this work, we propose a class of proactive policies that utilize future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get \u201ctoo bad.\u201d We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice. We also consider the impact of errors in the information provided by the predictive models and find that even with noisy predictions, our proposed policies can still outperform (achieving shorter delays while serving the same number of patients) standard diversion policies. If the quality of the predictive model is insufficient, then it is better to ignore the future information and simply rely on real-time, current information for the basis of decision making.

In this paper, motivated by the influenza vaccine industry, we study a supply chain contracting problem in the presence of uncertainties surrounding design, delivery, and demand of the influenza vaccine. In this supply chain, a manufacturer has insufficient incentive to initiate at-risk early production prior to the design freeze because it is a retailer who reaps the most benefits from selling more vaccines delivered on time. Anticipating that late delivery will lead to potential loss in demand, the retailer tends to reduce the order size, which further discourages the manufacturer from making an effort to improve its delivery performance. To break this negative feedback loop, a supply contract needs to achieve two objectives: incentivize at-risk early production and eliminate double marginalization. We find that two commonly observed supply contracts in practice, the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility (D-QF) contract and the late-rebate (LR) contract, may fail to coordinate the supply chain because of the tension between these two objectives. To resolve such a tension, we construct a buyback-and-late-rebate (BLR) contract and show that a properly designed BLR contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also can provide full flexibility of profit division between members of the supply chain. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that the BLR contract significantly improves supply chain efficiency compared to the contracts used in the industry.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2015.0574","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['supply chain', 'delivery', 'contract', 'vaccine', 'efficiency']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain management and contracting without a significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers\u2019 signals are available to all parties. Under this circumstance, the supplier will profit from information flow and the retailers can earn profit gains as well, whereas the consumers will be worse off.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0575","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information flow and competition in supply chains without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We develop two upper bounds on the number of lost rental units and two heuristics for the inventory decision. Numerical study shows the following: (1) accounting for rental unit loss can increase the expected profit by 7% for a single season; (2) the optimal inventory level in response to increasing loss probability is nonmonotonic; (3) both heuristics perform well; and (4) choosing the optimal recirculation rule over a commonly used policy can increase the profit-maximizing service level by up to six percentage points.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0576","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of rental business models and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We first examine the guaranteed-service model for a capacitated single-stage system with bounded demand. We characterize the optimal inventory policy, which depends on the entire demand history. Due to this complexity, we develop a heuristic, namely a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering. This is an order-up-to policy but with its replenishment orders censored by the capacity constraint. We refer to this heuristic as the modified constant base-stock policy (MCBS). We use a numerical experiment to compare the performance of the heuristic policy to the optimal policy. We find that the performance of the heuristic relative to the optimal policy improves with a tighter capacity constraint. We also observe that the performance of the heuristic itself can sometimes be improved by tightening the capacity constraint. We then use the results for a single-stage system to model a multistage serial system that operates with a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering, i.e., an MCBS policy. We show how to adapt the existing dynamic programming algorithm for the unconstrained case to solve for the safety-stock locations and base-stock levels in a capacitated serial system. We describe how to extend this model to other supply chain topologies. We report on numerical tests for serial systems and find that the best MCBS policy in a capacitated system can outperform the best constant base-stock policy in an identical but uncapacitated system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0577","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time\u2014a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems. Finally, through stochastic comparison techniques, we show how the magnitude and predictability of surge demand characteristics (mentioned above) and the cost profiles of each strategy impact the optimal joint strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0583","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and optimization strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Refurbishing to remarket or to fulfill warranty claims are the two common disposition options considered to unlock the value in consumer returns, which present the OEM with a challenging problem: How should an OEM dynamically allocate consumer returns between fulfilling warranty claims and remarketing refurbished products over the product\u2019s life cycle? We analyze this dynamic allocation problem and find that when warranty claims and consumer returns are jointly taken into account, the remarketing option is generally dominated by the option of refurbishing and earmarking consumer returns to fulfill warranty claims. Over the product\u2019s life cycle, the OEM should strategically emphasize earmarking of consumer returns at the early stages of the life cycle to build up earmarked inventory for the future warranty demand, whereas it should consider remarketing at the later stages of the life cycle after enough earmarked inventory is accumulated or most of the warranty demand uncertainty is resolved. These findings show that, for product categories with significant warranty coverage and refund costs, remarketing may not be the most profitable disposition option even if the product has strong remarketing potential and the OEM has the pricing leverage to tap into this market. We also show that the optimal dynamic disposition policy is a price-dependent base-stock policy where the earmarked quantity is capacitated by the new and refurbished product sales quantities. We compare with the myopic policy and show that it is a good heuristic for the optimal dynamic disposition policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0584","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of value recovery in consumer returns without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2016","18","4","Suresh Muthulingam\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Suresh Muthulingamsuresh@psu.eduSmeal College of Business, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802Search for more papers by this author, Anupam AgrawalAnupam Agrawalanupam@tamu.eduDepartment of Business Administration, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843Search for more papers by this author","Does Quality Knowledge Spillover at Shared Suppliers?

We analyze the quality performance of 191 suppliers, who utilize the same facilities to manufacture similar products for two distinct businesses: one that makes cars and the other that makes commercial vehicles. From 2006 to 2009, the car business undertook 2,121 quality improvement initiatives at these suppliers, while the commercial vehicles business did not undertake any such initiatives. We find that the quality knowledge developed through the quality improvement initiatives undertaken by the car business does not easily spill over to benefit the commercial vehicles business. Quality knowledge spills over under three conditions: (1) when quality improvement efforts are focused on organizational members, as opposed to when they focus on routines or technology; (2) when quality improvement efforts focus on the output activities of suppliers, not when they focus on the input or in-process activities; and (3) when quality knowledge is developed at suppliers with low complexity in their operations.

To understand the trade-offs involved in deciding when to hire the first employee and how hiring differs in entrepreneurial settings from more established firm settings, we present a simple growth model that depends on two critical inputs for revenue generation: the entrepreneur\u2019s time and money. We show that without hiring, the entrepreneur\u2019s time eventually becomes more valuable than money in contributing to the firm\u2019s growth. In that context, the value of the employee is driven by how much relief he provides to the entrepreneur. We characterize the optimal timing of hiring in terms of the firm\u2019s cash position and how the firm is affected if it requires an upfront fixed investment in time and/or money. We find that the upfront investment in time needed for hiring cannot be converted to an equivalent upfront investment in money and that mistiming hiring can be very costly, especially when these upfront investments are high.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0587","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of hiring decisions and their impact on firm growth without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

And, which customers are most likely to defect? Our empirical analysis of 82,235 customers exploits the varying competitive dynamics in 644 geographically isolated markets in which a nationwide retail bank conducted business over a five-year period. We find that customers defect at a higher rate from the incumbent following increased service quality (price) competition only when the incumbent offers high (low) quality service relative to existing competitors in a local market. We provide evidence that these results are due to a sorting effect, whereby firms trade off service quality and price, and, in turn, the incumbent attracts service (price) sensitive customers in markets where it has supplied relatively high (low) levels of service quality in the past. Furthermore, we show that it is the high quality incumbent\u2019s most profitable customers who are the most attracted by superior quality alternatives.

In the clearance phase, the firm decides how much to order for regular sales, as well as whether to markdown some (or all) of the leftover inventory from the previous period that will be disposed otherwise. Since strategic consumers may buy the product during clearance sales for future consumption, markdown may cannibalize future sales at regular price. Hence, the firm needs to make a trade-off between product spoilage and intertemporal demand substitution. We show that the firm should either put all of the leftover inventory on discount or dispose all of it, and the choice depends on the amount of leftover inventory from the previous period. In particular, the firm should introduce markdown when the amount of leftover inventory is higher than a certain threshold, and dispose all otherwise.

As economic applications, we prove uniqueness of the Hansen and Scheinkman factorization of the Markovian SDF corresponding to the recurrent eigenfunction; extend the Recovery Theorem from discrete time, finite state irreducible Markov chains to recurrent BRPs; and obtain the long-maturity asymptotics of the pricing operator. When an asset pricing model is specified by given risk-neutral probabilities together with a short rate function of the Markovian state, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a recurrent eigenfunction and provide explicit examples in a number of important financial models, including affine and quadratic diffusion models and an affine model with jumps.

We consider a single-period joint assortment and inventory planning problem under dynamic substitution with stochastic demands, and provide complexity and algorithmic results as well as insightful structural characterizations of near-optimal solutions for important variants of the problem. First, we show that the assortment planning problem is NP-hard even for a very simple consumer choice model, where each consumer is willing to buy only two products. In fact, we show that the problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than 1 \u2212 1/e. Second, we show that for several interesting and practical customer choice models, one can devise a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), i.e., the problem can be solved efficiently to within any level of accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm with provably near-optimal performance guarantees for assortment planning problems under dynamic substitution. Quite surprisingly, the algorithm we propose stocks only a constant number of different product types; this constant depends only on the desired accuracy level. This provides an important managerial insight that assortments with a relatively small number of product types can obtain almost all of the potential revenue. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be easily adapted for more general choice models, and we present numerical experiments to show that it performs significantly better than other known approaches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1450","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of assortment planning and algorithmic efficiency without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

Under classical marginal-cost pricing, the nonconvexity of the total cost may result in losses for some suppliers because they may fail to recover their fixed cost through commodity payments only. To address this problem, various pricing schemes that lift the price above marginal cost and/or provide side-payments (uplifts) have been proposed in the literature. We review several of these schemes, also proposing a new variant, in a two-supplier setting. We derive closed-form expressions for the price, uplifts, and profits that each scheme generates that enable us to analytically compare these schemes along these three dimensions. Our analysis complements known numerical comparisons available in the literature. We extend some of our analytical comparisons to the case of more than two suppliers and discuss extant numerical comparisons for this case.

This decision becomes particularly complex when customers are forward looking and may defer a purchase in the hope of future discounts and promotions. With such uncertainty, many customers may end up not buying or buying at a significantly lower price, reducing the firm\u2019s profitability. Recent studies show that a way to mitigate this negative effect caused by strategic consumers is to use a posted or preannounced pricing policy. With that policy, firms commit to a price path that consumers use to evaluate their purchase timing decision. In this paper, we propose a class of preannounced pricing policies in which the price path corresponds to a price menu contingent on the available inventory. We present a two-period model, with a monopolist selling a fixed inventory of a good. Given a menu of prices specified by the firm and beliefs regarding the number of units to be sold, customers decide whether to buy upon arrival, buy at the clearance price, or not to buy. The firm determines the set of prices that maximizes revenues. The solution to this problem requires the concept of equilibrium between the seller and the buyers that we analyze using a novel approach based on ordinary differential equations. We show existence of equilibrium and uniqueness when only one unit is on sale. However, if multiple units are offered, we show that multiple equilibria may arise. We develop a gradient-based method to solve the firm\u2019s optimization problem and conduct a computational study of different pricing schemes. The results show that under certain conditions the proposed contingent preannounced policy outperforms previously proposed pricing schemes. The source of the improvement comes from the use of the proposed pricing policy as a barrier to discourage strategic waiting and as a discrimination tool for those customers waiting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1452","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

These approximation methods are proposed because the dynamic programming formulation of the choice network revenue management problem is intractable even for moderately sized instances. In this paper, we consider three approximation methods that obtain upper bounds on the value function, namely, the choice deterministic linear program (CDLP), the affine approximation (AF), and the piecewise-linear approximation (PL). It is known that the piecewise-linear approximation bound is tighter than the affine bound, which in turn is tighter than CDLP. In this paper, we prove bounds on how much the affine and piecewise-linear approximations can tighten CDLP. We show (i) the gap between the AF and CDLP bounds is at most a factor of 1+1/(min\ud835\udc56\u2061{\ud835\udc5f1\ud835\udc56})1+1/(mini\u2061{ri1}), where \ud835\udc5f1\ud835\udc56>0ri1>0 are the resource capacities, and (ii) the gap between the piecewise-linear and CDLP bounds is within a factor of 2. Moreover, we show that these gaps are essentially tight. Our results hold for any discrete-choice model and do not involve any asymptotic scaling. Our results are surprising because calculating the AF bound is NP-hard and CDLP is tractable for a single-segment multinomial logit model; our result implies that if a firm has all resource capacities of 100, the gap between the two bounds, however, is at most 1.01.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1453","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical approximation methods for revenue management without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Recognizing this, data-driven approaches have been proposed in which the manager has no information beyond the evolving history of demand observations. In practice, managers often have some partial information about the demand distribution in addition to demand observations. We consider a repeated newsvendor setting, and propose a maximum-entropy based technique, termed Second Order Belief Maximum Entropy (SOBME), which allows the manager to effectively combine demand observations with distributional information in the form of bounds on the moments or tails. In the proposed approach, the decision maker forms a belief about possible demand distributions, and dynamically updates it over time using the available data and the partial distributional information. We derive a closed-form solution for the updating mechanism, and highlight that it generalizes the traditional Bayesian mechanism with an exponential modifier that accommodates partial distributional information. We prove the proposed approach is (weakly) consistent under some technical regularity conditions and we analytically characterize its rate of convergence. We provide an analytical upper bound for the newsvendor\u2019s cost of ambiguity, i.e., the extra per-period cost incurred because of ambiguity, under SOBME, and show that it approaches zero quite quickly. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SOBME performs very well. We find that it can be very beneficial to incorporate partial distributional information when deciding stocking quantities, and that information in the form of tighter moment bounds is typically more valuable than information in the form of tighter ambiguity sets. Moreover, unlike pure data-driven approaches, SOBME is fairly robust to the newsvendor quantile. Our results also show that SOBME quickly detects and responds to hidden changes in the unknown true distribution. We also extend our analysis to consider ambiguity aversion, and develop theoretical and numerical results for the ambiguity-averse, repeated newsvendor setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1454","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand forecasting and decision-making without addressing any social themes, ethics, or issues related to diversity or inclusion.

The proposed multistage robust UC model takes into account the time causality of the hourly unfolding of uncertainty in the power system operation process, which we show to be relevant when ramping capacities are limited and net loads present significant variability.

In contrast to multinomial and nested logit (the prevailing choice models used for optimizing prices and assortments), this model assumes a negatively skewed distribution of consumer utilities, an assumption we motivate by conceptual arguments as well as published work. The choice probabilities in this model can be derived in closed form as an exponomial (a linear function of exponential terms). The pricing and assortment planning insights we obtain from the exponomial choice (EC) model differ from the literature in two important ways. First, the EC model allows variable markups in optimal prices that increase with expected utilities. Second, when prices are exogenous, the optimal assortment may exhibit leapfrogging in prices, i.e., a product can be skipped in favor of a lower-priced one depending on the utility positions of neighboring products. These two plausible pricing and assortment patterns are ruled out by multinomial logit (and by nested logit within each nest). We provide structural results on optimal pricing for monopoly and oligopoly cases, and on the optimal assortments for both exogenous and endogenous prices. We also demonstrate how the EC model can be easily estimated\u2014by establishing that the log-likelihood function is concave in model parameters and detailing an estimation example using real data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1459","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of pricing and assortment optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Under FIT mechanisms, governments purchase green energy at tariffs that are set above market price. The success or failure of FIT policies, in turn, critically depend on how these tariffs are determined and adjusted over time. This paper provides insights into designing cost-efficient and socially optimal FIT programs. Our modeling framework captures key market dynamics as well as investors\u2019 strategic behavior. In this framework, we establish that the current practice of maintaining constant profitability is theoretically rarely optimal. By contrast, we characterize a no-delay region in the problem\u2019s parameters, such that profitability should strictly decrease over time if the diffusion and learning rates belong to this region. In this case, investors never strategically postpone their investment to a later period. When the diffusion and learning rates fall outside the region, profitability should increase at least temporarily over some time periods and strategic delays occur. The presence of strategic delays, however, makes the practical problem of computing optimal FIT schedules very difficult. To address this issue, the regulator may focus on policies that disincentivize investors to postpone their investment. With this additional constraint, a constant profitability policy is optimal if and only if the diffusion and learning rates fall outside the no-delay region. This provides partial justifications for current FIT implementations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1460","","OR","Multidisciplinary","4","['renewable energy', 'green technologies', 'socially optimal', 'cost-efficient']","The article discusses renewable energy and green technologies, which align with sustainability themes, but it primarily focuses on economic efficiency rather than social justice or equity.

Under this assumption, however, past research has established that a quota-bonus contract\u2014a widely adopted sales-force compensation contract in the practice\u2014cannot sustain in equilibrium. We show that because of demand censoring in the presence of limited inventory (i.e., demand realizations higher than the inventory level are unobservable), a quota-bonus contract is the optimal equilibrium contract, and it exists, even for a demand distribution with the IFR property. Since most well-known distributions satisfy the IFR property, and inventory constraints are operative in many real-world situations, our results significantly extend the scope of the optimality of quota-bonus contracts and underscore the importance of considering the inventory aspect while making sales-force compensation decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1461","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and sales-force compensation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional finance problems with discontinuities can be inefficient because of the lack of good smoothness and high dimensionality. Interestingly, path simulation method (PSM) may affect both factors, implying its significance in QMC methods. What defines a \u201cgood\u201d PSM for problems with discontinuities? The ability to align the discontinuities with the coordinate axes is a desirable property for a PSM. We show that for an arbitrary PSM, there exists a class of options with discontinuous payoff functions such that the transformed functions have only axis-parallel discontinuities, for which good QMC performance can be expected. In this sense, any PSM can be \u201cgood\u201d in QMC methods for a specific class of problems. We analyze the structure of discontinuities for digital options using the new approach and show the superiority and the uniqueness (up to a permutation) of the standard construction. We develop a two-step procedure for pricing and hedging derivatives with discontinuous payoff functions. The first step is to design a good PSM that has the ability to align the discontinuities with the coordinate axes and the second step is to further exploit this nice property to remove the discontinuities completely. We prove that the new estimate is unbiased and has smaller variance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the two-step procedure is very effective in QMC methods for pricing options and estimating Greeks, leading to a dramatic variance reduction. Both the path simulation step and the smoothing step are crucial and beneficial for QMC methods, with the contribution from each step varying depending on the severity of discontinuity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1470","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial engineering and does not address any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2016","64","2","Adam N.

The occurrence of such a hazard is known only to the firm. The regulator, if finding a hazard, collects a fine and mandates the firm to perform costly remediation that reduces the environmental damage. The regulator may inspect the firm at any time to uncover the hazard. However, because inspections are costly, the regulator also offers a reward to the firm for voluntarily disclosing the hazard. The reward corresponds to either a subsidy or a reduced fine, depending on whether it is positive or negative. Thus, the regulator needs to dynamically determine the reward and inspection policy that minimizes expected societal cost in the long run. We model this problem as a dynamic adverse selection problem with costly state verification in continuous time. Despite the complexity and generality of this setup, we show that the optimal regulation policy follows a very simple cyclic structure, which we fully characterize in closed form. Specifically, the regulator runs scheduled inspections periodically. After each inspection, the reward level decreases over time until a subsequent inspection takes place. If a hazard is not revealed, the reward level is reset to a high level, restarting the cycle. In contrast to the reward level, the mandated remediation level is constant over time. Nonetheless, when subsidies are not allowed in the industry, we show that the regulator should dynamically adjust this remediation level, which then acts as a substitute for a subsidy. Our analysis further reveals that optimal inspection frequency increases not only when the inspection accuracy decreases, but also when the penalty for not disclosing the hazard increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1476","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['environmental', 'disclosure', 'societal cost', 'hazard', 'regulator']","The article discusses environmental disclosures and regulations, emphasizing the societal cost associated with environmental hazards, which aligns with moderate woke themes of sustainability and ethical practices in business.

We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi\u2019s Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1478","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We show that, surprisingly, long chain is not always optimal in this class of networks even for i.i.d. demand distributions. In particular, we present a family of instances where a disconnected network with 2n edges has a strictly better performance than the long chain under a specific class of i.i.d. demand distributions.

This is mainly due to the simplicity of the modeling process and ease of resolution even for large scale models. Unfortunately, the second property is usually lost when the cost function that needs to be \u201crobustified\u201d is not concave (or linear) with respect to the perturbing parameters. In this paper we study robust optimization of sums of piecewise linear functions over polyhedral uncertainty set. Given that these problems are known to be intractable, we propose a new scheme for constructing conservative approximations based on the relaxation of an embedded mixed-integer linear program and relate this scheme to methods that are based on exploiting affine decision rules. Our new scheme gives rise to two tractable models that, respectively, take the shape of a linear program and a semidefinite program, with the latter having the potential to provide solutions of better quality than the former at the price of heavier computations. We present conditions under which our approximation models are exact. In particular, we are able to propose the first exact reformulations for a robust (and distributionally robust) multi-item newsvendor problem with budgeted uncertainty set and a reformulation for robust multiperiod inventory problems that is exact whether the uncertainty region reduces to a L1-norm ball or to a box. An extensive set of empirical results will illustrate the quality of the approximate solutions that are obtained using these two models on randomly generated instances of the latter problem.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1483","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of robust optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Following standard practice, the day is divided into time periods of equal length (e.g., 15 or 30 minutes), the arrival rate is assumed random but constant in time in each period, and the arrivals are from a Poisson process, conditional on the rate. The random rate for each period is taken as a deterministic base rate (or expected rate) multiplied by a random busyness factor having mean 1. Models in which the busyness factors are independent across periods, or in which a common busyness factor applies to all periods, have been studied previously. But they are not sufficiently realistic. We examine alternative models for which the busyness factors have some form of dependence across periods. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation for these models is not easy, mainly because the arrival rates themselves are never observed. We develop specialized techniques to perform this estimation. We compare the goodness-of-fit of these models on arrival data from three call centers, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our models can represent arrivals in many other types of systems as well. Estimating a model for the vector of counts (the number of arrivals in each period) is generally easier than for the vector of rates, because the counts can be observed, but a model for the rates is often more convenient and natural, e.g., for simulation. We examine and provide insight on the relationship between these two types of modeling. In particular, we give explicit formulas for the relationship between the correlation between rates and that between counts in two given periods, and for the variance and dispersion index in a given period. These formulas imply that for a given correlation between the rates, the correlation between the counts is much smaller in low traffic than in high traffic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1484","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling of arrival rates in call centers without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

In such networks, the links do not attain their nominal (maximum) capacity simultaneously, so in a typical network state only some links are fully available whereas on each of the remaining links only a fraction of its maximum capacity is usable. Every end-to-end traffic demand is assigned a set of logical tunnels whose total capacity is dedicated to carry the demand\u2019s traffic. The nominal (i.e., maximum) capacity of the tunnels, supported by the nominal (maximum) link capacity, is subject to state-dependent thinning to account for variable capacity of the links fluctuating below the maximum. Accordingly, the capacity available on the tunnels is also fluctuating below their nominal levels and hence the instantaneous traffic sent between the demand\u2019s end nodes must accommodate to the current total capacity available on its dedicated tunnels. The related multi-commodity flow optimization problem is \ud835\udca9\ud835\udcab-hard and its noncompact linear programming formulation requires path generation. For that, we formulate an integer programming pricing problem, at the same time showing the cases when the pricing is polynomial. We also consider an important variant of FT, affine thinning, that may lead to practical FT implementations. We present a numerical study illustrating traffic efficiency of FT and computational efficiency of its optimization models.

However, if the network effect is strong, then the optimal pricing decision is to set the price of one product low and to set the prices of all other products to a single high value. This boosts the sales of the single low-price product in comparison to the sales of all other products. We also obtain comparative statics results that describe how optimal prices and sales levels vary with a parameter that determines the strength of the network effects. We extend our analysis to settings with heterogeneous products and establish that optimal solutions have a structure similar to that found in the homogeneous case: either maintain a semblance of balance among all products or boost the sales of just one product.

There are two kinds of costs: individual costs incurred by each agent and local-interaction costs incurred by each agent and its neighbors in the social network. Moreover, agents have inertia: each agent has a default mixed strategy that stays fixed regardless of the state of the environment, and must expend effort to deviate from this strategy in order to respond to cost signals coming from the environment. We construct a decentralized strategy, wherein each agent selects its action based only on the costs directly affecting it and on the decisions made by its neighbors in the network.

This model generalizes the DeGroot model to account for negative links: when two adversaries interact, their opinions go in opposite directions. We provide conditions for convergence and divergence in expectation, in mean-square, and in almost sure sense and exhibit phase transition phenomena for these notions of convergence depending on the parameters of the opinion update model and on the structure of the underlying graph.

In fact, the USA Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Section 1223) states that the United States should \u201cencourage, as appropriate, the deployment of advanced transmission technologies\u201d including \u201coptimized transmission line configurations.\u201d As such, many authors have studied the problem of determining an optimal set of transmission lines to switch off to minimize the cost of meeting a given power demand under the direct current (DC) model of power flow. This problem is known in the literature as the Direct-Current Optimal Transmission Switching Problem (DC-OTS). Most research on DC-OTS has focused on heuristic algorithms for generating quality solutions or on the application of DC-OTS to crucial operational and strategic problems such as contingency correction, real-time dispatch, and transmission expansion. The mathematical theory of the DC-OTS problem is less well developed. In this work, we formally establish that DC-OTS is NP-Hard, even if the power network is a series-parallel graph with at most one load/demand pair. Inspired by Kirchoff\u2019s Voltage Law, we provide a cycle-based formulation for DC-OTS, and we use the new formulation to build a cycle-induced relaxation. We characterize the convex hull of the cycle-induced relaxation; this characterization provides strong valid inequalities that can be used in a cutting-plane approach to solve the DC-OTS.

We derive two new reformulations and give sufficient conditions under which the reformulated problem is equivalent. The second reformulation provides a much sparser representation of the feasible set of the chance constraint and offers tremendous computational advantages. This new reformulation method can be used for linear stochastic inequalities and will also significantly improve the solution of such joint chance-constrained problems.

This so-called high-dimensional statistical regime has been the object of intense recent research in machine learning and statistics, primarily due to phenomena inherent to this regime, such as the fact that the noise one sees here often dwarfs the magnitude of the signal itself. While relevant in numerous important operations research and engineering optimization applications, this setup falls far outside the traditional scope of robust and stochastic optimization. We propose three algorithms to address this setting, combining ideas from statistics, machine learning, and robust optimization. Our algorithms are motivated by three natural optimization objectives: minimizing the number of grossly violated constraints; maximizing the number of exactly satisfied constraints; and, finally, developing algorithms whose running time scales with the intrinsic dimension of a problem, as opposed to its observed dimension\u2014a mismatch that, as we discuss in detail, can be dire in settings where constraints are meant to describe preferences of behaviors. The key ingredients of our algorithms are dimensionality reduction techniques from machine learning, robust optimization, and concentration of measure tools from statistics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1504","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization problems and algorithms without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One of the key challenges in an assortment planning problem is to identify the \u201cright\u201d model for the substitution behavior of customers from the data. Error in model selection can lead to highly suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we consider a Markov chain based choice model and show that it provides a simultaneous approximation for all random utility based discrete choice models including the multinomial logit (MNL), the probit, the nested logit and mixtures of multinomial logit models. In the Markov chain model, substitution from one product to another is modeled as a state transition in the Markov chain. We show that the choice probabilities computed by the Markov chain based model are a good approximation to the true choice probabilities for any random utility based choice model under mild conditions. Moreover, they are exact if the underlying model is a generalized attraction model (GAM) of which the MNL model is a special case. We also show that the assortment optimization problem for our choice model can be solved efficiently in polynomial time. In addition to the theoretical bounds, we also conduct numerical experiments and observe that the average maximum relative error of the choice probabilities of our model with respect to the true probabilities for any offer set is less than 3% where the average is taken over different offer sets. Therefore, our model provides a tractable approach to choice modeling and assortment optimization that is robust to model selection errors. Moreover, the state transition primitive for substitution provides interesting insights to model the substitution behavior in many real-world applications.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1505","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of choice modeling and assortment planning without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit the opportunistically underutilized licensed spectrum. Market mechanism is a widely used promising means to regulate the consuming behaviours of users and, hence, achieve the efficient allocation and consumption of limited resources. In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market consisting of both the futures market and the spot market, in which SUs (buyers) purchase underutilized licensed spectrum from a spectrum regulator (SR), either through predefined contracts via the futures market, or through spot transactions via the spot market. We focus on the optimal spectrum allocation among SUs in an exogenous hybrid market that maximizes the secondary spectrum utilization efficiency. The problem is challenging because of the stochasticity and asymmetry of network information. To solve this problem, we first derive an off-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex ante expected spectrum utilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network information. We then propose an online Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction that determines the real-time allocation and pricing of every spectrum based on the realized network information and the prederived off-line policy. We further show that with the spatial frequency reuse, the proposed VCG auction is NP-hard; hence, it is not suitable for online implementation, especially in a large-scale market. To this end, we propose a heuristics approach based on an online VCG-like mechanism with polynomial-time complexity, and further characterize the corresponding performance loss bound analytically. We finally provide extensive numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1507","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market mechanisms for spectrum allocation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Customer demand is compound Poisson distributed and unsatisfied demand at each stock point is backordered and allocated on a first-come first-served basis.

The approach analyzes the optimal solution to a static (nonadaptive) version of an AMIO problem to gain insight into which regions of the uncertainty set are restricting the objective function value. We use this information to construct partitions in the uncertainty set, leading to a finitely adaptable formulation of the problem. We use the same information to determine a lower bound on the fully adaptive solution. The method repeats this process iteratively to further improve the objective until a desired gap is reached. We provide theoretical motivation for this method, and characterize its convergence properties and the growth in the number of partitions. Using these insights, we propose and evaluate enhancements to the method such as warm starts and smarter partition creation. We describe in detail how to apply finite adaptability to multistage AMIO problems to appropriately address nonanticipativity restrictions. Finally, we demonstrate in computational experiments that the method can provide substantial improvements over a nonadaptive solution and existing methods for problems described in the literature. In particular, we find that our method produces high-quality solutions versus the amount of computational effort, even as the problem scales in the number of time stages and the number of decision variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1515","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization method without any mention of social themes, diversity, ethics, or social justice.

A solution in discretized time identifies a profit-maximizing extraction (mining) schedule for the blocks. Our model variant, a mixed-integer program (MIP), presumes a predetermined destination for each extracted block, namely, processing plant or waste dump. The MIP incorporates standard constructs but also adds not-so-standard lower bounds on resource consumption in each time period and allows fractional block extraction in a novel fashion while still enforcing pit-wall slope restrictions. A new extension of nested Benders decomposition, \u201chierarchical\u201d Benders decomposition (HBD), solves the MIP\u2019s linear-programming relaxation. HBD exploits time-aggregated variables and can recursively decompose a model into a master problem and two subproblems rather than the usual single subproblem. A specialized branch-and-bound heuristic then produces high-quality, mixed-integer solutions. Medium-sized problems (e.g., 25,000 blocks and 20 time periods) solve to near optimality in minutes. To the best of our knowledge, these computational results are the best known for instances of OPBS that enforce lower bounds on resource consumption.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1516","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in mining without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

These are very challenging problems because the tax owed whenever a security is sold depends on the cost basis, and this results in high-dimensional problems, which cannot be solved exactly except in the case of very stylized problems with just one or two securities and relatively few time periods. In this paper, we focus on exact and average cost-basis problems, make the limited use of losses (LUL) assumption and develop simple heuristic trading policies for these problems when there are differential tax rates for long- and short-term gains and losses. We use information relaxation-based duality techniques to assess the performance of these trading policies by constructing unbiased lower and upper bounds on the (unknown) optimal value function. In numerical experiments with as many as 80 time periods and 25 securities we find our best suboptimal policy is within 3\u201310 basis points of optimality on a certainty equivalent (CE) annualized return basis. The principal contribution of this paper is in demonstrating that while the primal problem remains very challenging to solve exactly, we can easily solve very large dual problem instances.

Importantly, knowledge of global parameters, such as the distribution of search terms, is not required when separating the problem in this way. Exploiting the information asymmetry between the platform and advertiser, we describe a simple mechanism that incentivizes truthful bidding, has a unique Nash equilibrium that is socially optimal, and thus implements our decomposition. Further, we consider models where advertisers adapt their bids smoothly over time and prove convergence to the solution that maximizes social welfare.

The stability of the new framework depends on the CCPs\u2019 resilience. Margin requirements are a CCP\u2019s first line of defense against the default of a counterparty. To capture liquidity costs at default, margin requirements need to increase superlinearly in position size. However, convex margin requirements create an incentive for a swaps dealer to split its positions across multiple CCPs, effectively \u201chiding\u201d potential liquidation costs from each CCP. To compensate, each CCP needs to set higher margin requirements than it would in isolation. In a model with two CCPs, we define an equilibrium as a pair of margin schedules through which both CCPs collect sufficient margin under a dealer\u2019s optimal allocation of trades. In the case of linear price impact, we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an equilibrium is that the two CCPs agree on liquidity costs, and we characterize all equilibria when this holds.

The model shows that when financial innovation reduces the cost of diversification below a given threshold, the strength (because of higher leverage) and coordination (because of similarity of bank portfolios) of feedback effects increase, triggering a transition from a stationary dynamics of price returns to a nonstationary one characterized by steep growths (bubbles) and plunges (bursts) of market prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2015.1464","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial innovation and risk management without addressing social themes such as equity, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The main result is that the only risk measures that satisfy a set of economic axioms for the Choquet expected utility and the statistical property of general elicitability (i.e., there exists an objective function such that minimizing the expected objective function yields the risk measure) are the mean functional and value-at-risk (VaR), in particular the median shortfall, which is the median of tail loss distribution and is also the VaR at a higher confidence level. We also discuss various approaches of backtesting and their relations to elicitability and co-elicitability; in particular, we show that the co-elicitability of VaR and expected shortfall does not lead to a reliable backtesting method for expected shortfall and there have been only indirect backtesting methods for expected shortfall. Furthermore, we extend the result to address model uncertainty by incorporating multiple scenarios. As an application, we argue that median shortfall is a better alternative than expected shortfall for setting capital requirements in Basel Accords.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1539","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of economic tail risk measurement and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These three relaxations are incomparable to each other and two of them are incomparable to the standard SDP relaxation of OPF. Extensive computational experiments show that these relaxations have numerous advantages over existing convex relaxations in the literature: (i) their solution quality is extremely close to that of the standard SDP relaxation (the best one is within 99.96% of the SDP relaxation on average for all the IEEE test cases) and consistently outperforms previously proposed convex quadratic relaxations of the OPF problem, (ii) the solutions from the strong SOCP relaxations can be directly used as a warm start in a local solver such as IPOPT to obtain a high quality feasible OPF solution, and (iii) in terms of computation times, the strong SOCP relaxations can be solved an order of magnitude faster than the standard SDP relaxation. For example, one of the proposed SOCP relaxations together with IPOPT produces a feasible solution for the largest instance in the IEEE test cases (the 3375-bus system) and also certifies that this solution is within 0.13% of global optimality, all this computed within 157.20 seconds on a modest personal computer. Overall, the proposed strong SOCP relaxations provide a practical approach to obtain feasible OPF solutions with extremely good quality within a time framework that is compatible with the real-time operation in the current industry practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1489","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of power flow optimization without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We present new results indicating that, for known sampling noise, variants of EI produce asymptotic simulation allocations that are essentially identical to those chosen by the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) methodology, which is known to yield near-optimal asymptotic performance in ranking and selection.

Repair of failed parts may be expedited at an additional cost to receive a shorter lead time. Demand that cannot be filled immediately is backordered and penalized. The manager decides on the number of spare repairables to purchase and on the expediting policy. We characterize the optimal expediting policy using a Markov decision process formulation and provide closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions that determine whether the optimal policy is a type of threshold policy or a no-expediting policy. We derive further asymptotic results as demand fluctuates arbitrarily slowly. In this regime, the cost of this system can be written as a weighted average of costs for systems facing Poisson demand. These asymptotics are leveraged to show that approximating Markov modulated Poisson demand by stationary Poisson demand can lead to arbitrarily poor results. We propose two heuristics based on our analytical results, and numerical tests show good performance with average optimality gaps of 0.11% and 0.33% respectively. Naive heuristics that ignore demand fluctuations have average optimality gaps of more than 11%. This shows that there is great value in leveraging knowledge about demand fluctuations in making repairable expediting and stocking decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1498","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and decision-making processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By definition, 1-clubs are cliques and the model is a distance-based relaxation of the clique definition for larger values of k. The k-club model is particularly interesting to study from a polyhedral perspective as the property is not hereditary on induced subgraphs when k is larger than one. This article introduces a new family of facet-defining inequalities for the 2-club polytope that unifies all previously known facets through a less restrictive combinatorial property, namely, independent (distance) 2-domination. The complexity of separation over this new family of inequalities is shown to be NP-hard. An exact formulation of this separation problem and a greedy separation heuristic are also proposed. The polytope described by the new inequalities (and nonnegativity) is then investigated and shown to be integral for acyclic graphs. An additional family of facets is also demonstrated for cycles of length indivisible by three. The effectiveness of these new facets as cutting planes and the difficulty of solving the separation problem in practice are then investigated via computational experiments on a test bed of benchmark instances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1500","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of graph theory and polyhedral studies without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The Attacker wins if the Patroller does not visit the chosen node while it is being attacked; otherwise, the Patroller wins. This paper studies the patrolling game where the network is a line graph of n nodes, which models the problem of guarding a channel or protecting a border from infiltration.

In reality, demands are often submitted by selfish entities (players) and congestion on the resources results in negative externalities for their users. We consider a policy maker that can set a priori rules to minimize the inefficiency induced by selfish players. For example, these rules may assume the form of scheduling policies or pricing decisions. We explore the space of such rules abstracted as cost-sharing methods.

Recently, Goldberg and coauthors laid the foundations for a new approach to solving these models, by proving that as the lead time grows large, a simple constant-order policy is asymptotically optimal. However, the bounds proven there require the lead time to be very large before the constant-order policy becomes effective, in contrast to the good numerical performance demonstrated by Zipkin even for small lead time values. In this work, we prove that for the infinite-horizon variant of the same lost sales problem, the optimality gap of the same constant-order policy actually converges exponentially fast to zero, with the optimality gap decaying to zero at least as fast as the exponential rate of convergence of the expected waiting time in a related single-server queue to its steady-state value. We also derive simple and explicit bounds for the optimality gap, and demonstrate good numerical performance across a wide range of parameter values for the special case of exponentially distributed demand.

This brings challenges for independent power producers to provide optimal bidding strategies. The traditional approaches of only attending the day-ahead market might not be profitable enough without taking advantage of real-time price volatility. In this paper, we study the optimal bidding strategies for the independent power producers utilizing self-scheduling strategies to participate in the real-time market considering real-time electricity price volatility, with the objective of maximizing the total expected profit. Considering the correlations of renewable energy generation outputs among different time periods, the correlations of real-time prices are captured in our modeling framework, in which we explore a multistage stochastic scenario tree to formulate the price uncertainties. Accordingly, the derived multistage stochastic self-scheduling unit commitment problem is transformed as a deterministic equivalent mixed-integer linear programming formulation. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we develop strong valid inequalities for the derived stochastic unit commitment polytope to speed up the algorithms to solve the problem. In particular, we derive strong valid inequalities that can provide the convex hull descriptions for the two-period case and a special class of the three-period cases with rigorous proofs provided. Furthermore, strong valid inequalities, including facet-defining proofs, for multistage cases are proposed to further strengthen the model. Finally, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our derived strong valid inequalities by incorporating them in a branch-and-cut framework.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1520","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimal bidding strategies for independent power producers in the context of renewable energy and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations."],["2016","64","6","Darinka Dentcheva\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Darinka Dentchevadarinka.dentcheva@stevens.eduStevens Institute of Technology, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030Search for more papers by this author, Gabriela MartinezGabriela Martinezmartinez.maria@mayo.eduKern Center for Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905Search for more papers by this author, Eli WolfhagenEli Wolfhagenewolfhag@stevens.eduStevens Institute of Technology, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030Search for more papers by this author","Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Solving Optimization Problems with Stochastic-Order Constraints","We investigate risk-averse stochastic optimization problems with a risk-shaping constraint in the form of a stochastic-order relation.

We show that the optimal policies can be characterized by two thresholds for each age group of inventory: a lower one and a higher one. For an age group of inventory with a remaining lifetime of two periods or longer, if its inventory level is below its lower threshold, then there is no clearance sales; if it is above its higher threshold, then it will be cleared down to the higher threshold. The optimal policy for the age group of inventory with a one-period remaining lifetime is different. Clearance sales may occur if its inventory level is above its higher threshold or below its lower threshold. The phenomenon that a clearance sale happens when the inventory is low is driven by the need to segregate the newest inventory from the oldest inventory and is unique to the LIFO issuing rule. The optimal policy requires a full inventory record of every age group and its computation is challenging. We consider two myopic heuristics that require only partial information. The first requires only the information about the total inventory and the second requires the information about the total inventory as well as the information about the inventory with a one-period remaining lifetime.

We study the value (social welfare and consumer surplus) obtained by adding unlicensed spectrum to an existing allocation of licensed spectrum among incumbent service providers. We assume a population of customers who choose a provider based on the minimum delivered price, given by the weighted sum of the price of the service and a congestion cost, which depends on the number of subscribers in a band. We consider models in which this weighting is uniform across the customer population and where the weighting is high or low, reflecting different sensitivities to latency. For the models considered, we find that the social welfare depends on the amount of additional unlicensed spectrum, and can actually decrease over a significant range of unlicensed bandwidths.

Computational studies in the literature often involve approximating a large number of scenarios by using a small number of scenarios to be processed via deterministic solvers, or running Sample Average Approximation on some genre of high performance machines so that statistically acceptable bounds can be obtained. In this paper we show that for a class of stochastic linear programming problems, an alternative approach known as Stochastic Decomposition (SD) can provide solutions of similar quality in far less computational time using ordinary desktop or laptop machines of today. In addition to these compelling computational results, we provide a stronger convergence result for SD, and introduce a new solution concept that we call the compromise decision. This new concept is attractive for algorithms that call for multiple replications in sampling-based convex optimization algorithms. For such replicated optimization, we show that the difference between an average solution and a compromise decision provides a natural stopping rule. We discuss three stopping criteria that enhance the reliability of the compromise decision, reducing bias and variance associated with the result. Finally our computational results cover a variety of instances from the literature, including a detailed study of SONET Switched Network (SSN), a network planning instance known to be more challenging than other test instances in the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1526","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic programming and computational methods without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

First, we introduce exact algorithms based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations of the collective rationality tests, which can be usefully applied to medium-sized data sets.

When production lead-time is long and the selling season is short, the retailer has to place an order ahead of the season, which resembles the classical Newsvendor model. However, we consider the situation when the supplier agrees to deliver the order in multiple shipments in the season, and then the retailer needs to determine the quantity and/or timing of each shipment. Under a centralized setting, we derive the optimal quantity and/or timing decisions of the retailer. Under a decentralized setting, incentive misalignment arises from ineffective allocation of inventory costs between the parties, in addition to the well- known double marginalization effect. Hence, we devise an incentive contract, which involves a risk-sharing mechanism at the end of the season and an inventory subsidizing scheme for the entire season; in practice, the inventory subsidizing scheme can be implemented in different ways, such as a direct subsidizing scheme or a delayed-payment scheme. The proposed contract can achieve channel coordination and Pareto optimality. Furthermore, we can show that the inventory subsidizing scheme plays a key role in channel coordination because without the inventory subsidizing scheme, the loss of supply chain efficiency is almost always significant.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1529","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory contracts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Among these procedures, frequentist procedures are typically designed under either the subset-selection (SS) formulation or the indifference-zone (IZ) formulation. Both formulations may encounter problems when the goal is to select the unique best alternative for any configuration of the means. In particular, SS procedures may return a subset that contains more than one alternative, and IZ procedures hinge on the relationship between the chosen IZ parameter and the true mean differences that is unknown to decision makers a priori. In this paper, we propose a new formulation that guarantees to select the unique best alternative with a user-specified probability of correct selection (PCS), as long as the means of alternatives are unique, and we design a class of fully sequential procedures under this formulation. These procedures are parameterized by the PCS value only, and their continuation boundaries are determined based on the Law of the Iterated Logarithm. Furthermore, we show that users can add a stopping criterion to these procedures to convert them into IZ procedures, and we argue that these procedures have several advantages over existing IZ procedures. Lastly, we conduct an extensive numerical study to show the performance of our procedures and compare their performance to existing procedures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1530","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical procedures for selecting alternatives based on statistical performance without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Although such MDPs arise naturally in many practical applications, they are often difficult to solve exactly due to the enormous size of the state space of the complete system, which grows exponentially with the number of components. In this paper, we propose an approximate solution approach to decomposable MDPs that is based on re-solving a fluid linear optimization formulation of the problem at each decision epoch. This formulation tractably approximates the problem by modeling transition behavior at the level of the individual components rather than the complete system. We prove that our fluid formulation provides a tighter bound on the optimal value function than three state-of-the-art formulations: the approximate linear optimization formulation, the classical Lagrangian relaxation formulation, and a novel, alternate Lagrangian relaxation that is based on relaxing an action consistency constraint. We provide a numerical demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach in the area of multiarmed bandit problems, where we show that our approach provides near optimal performance and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1531","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decomposable Markov decision processes and optimization techniques without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In this paper, we consider four variants of the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows: (i) at most a single recharge per route is allowed, and batteries are fully recharged on visit of a recharging station; (ii) multiple recharges per route, full recharges only; (iii) at most a single recharge per route, and partial battery recharges are possible; and (iv) multiple, partial recharges. For each variant, we present exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms that rely on customized monodirectional and bidirectional labeling algorithms for generating feasible vehicle routes. In computational studies, we find that all four variants are solvable for instances with up to 100 customers and 21 recharging stations. This success can be attributed to the tailored resource extension functions (REFs) that enable efficient labeling with constant time feasibility checking and strong dominance rules, even if these REFs are intricate and rather elaborate to derive. The studies also highlight the superiority of the bidirectional labeling algorithms compared to the monodirectional ones. Finally, we find that allowing multiple as well as partial recharges both help to reduce routing costs and the number of employed vehicles in comparison to the variants with single and with full recharges.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1535","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical algorithms for optimizing electric vehicle routing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Examples include loan portfolios held by financial institutions and fixed-income investors as well as pools of loans backing mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The size of these portfolios can range from the thousands to even hundreds of thousands. Optimal portfolio selection requires the solution of a high-dimensional nonlinear integer program and is extremely computationally challenging. For larger portfolios, this optimization problem is intractable. We propose an approximate optimization approach that yields an asymptotically optimal portfolio for a broad class of data-driven models of loan delinquency and prepayment. We prove that the asymptotically optimal portfolio converges to the optimal portfolio as the portfolio size grows large. Numerical case studies using actual loan data demonstrate its computational efficiency. The asymptotically optimal portfolio\u2019s computational cost does not increase with the size of the portfolio.

Ordering from either source/mode incurs a fixed cost and the expedited mode provides a shorter lead time than the regular mode. As the optimal ordering policy is unknown, while expected to be very complicated, we propose a class of simple policies called single-index (R, nQ) policies\u2014when ordering from each mode, based on the inventory position, the system follows an (R, nQ)-type of policy. We provide an exact procedure to compute the expected long-run average cost. Specifically, we first analyze the steady-state distribution of the inventory position, which is found to be no longer uniform in general as in the classic (R, nQ) inventory system where only one delivery mode is available. We then develop a recursive procedure, which overcomes the order-crossing effect, to determine the steady-state distribution of the inventory level. Two simple heuristics for computing near-optimal policy parameters are provided. For a special case where ordering from the regular mode incurs no fixed cost and follows a base-stock policy, we derive closed-form solution bounds by applying normal approximation. To assess the performance of the single-index (R, nQ) policy, we further study a more complicated class of policies called dual-index (R, nQ) policies and numerically illustrate that the simpler single-index policy performs close to the dual-index policy. Finally, the performance of the single-index policy is also shown comparable to the policy computed via dynamic programming.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1538","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and optimization policies without any reference to social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In conjunction, we allow expediting of components and partially completed subassemblies in the system to provide the supply chain with the means to manage the stockout risk and significantly enhance cost savings realized through advance demand information. To solve the resulting assembly system, we develop a new method based on identifying local properties of optimal decisions. This new method allows us to solve assembly systems with multiple product flows. We derive the structure of the optimal policy, which represents a double-tiered echelon basestock policy whose basestock levels depend on the state of advance demand information. This form of the optimal policy allows us to: (i) provide actionable policies for firms to manage large-scale assembly systems with expediting and advance demand information; (ii) prove that advance demand information and expediting of stock both reduce the amount of inventory optimally held in the system; and (iii) numerically solve such assembly systems, and quantify the savings realized.

Specifically, we suggest that the negative feelings and emotions resulting from the experience of occupying a low-status position interact with the action-facilitating effects of power to produce vicious cycles of interpersonal conflict and demeaning behavior. Five studies demonstrate that power without status leads to interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment, both in specific dyadic work relationships and among organizational members more broadly. Study 1 provides initial support for the prediction that employees in low-status/high-power roles engage in more conflict with coworkers than all other combinations of status and power. In Studies 2a and 2b, a yoked experimental design replicated this effect and established low-status/high-power roles as a direct source of the interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment. Study 3 used an experimental manipulation of relative status and power within specific dyadic relationships in the workplace and found evidence of a vicious cycle of interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment within any dyad that included a low-status/high-power individual. Finally, Study 4 utilized survey and human resource data from a large government agency to replicate the power without status effect on interpersonal conflict and demonstrate that power interacts with subjective status change to produce a similar effect; increasing the status of a high-power role reduces conflict whereas decreasing its status increases conflict. Taken together, these findings offer a role-based account of interpersonal conflict and highlight the importance of making a theoretical distinction between status and power.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.1019","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['social hierarchy', 'interpersonal conflict', 'status', 'power', 'demeaning behavior']","The article discusses themes related to social hierarchy and interpersonal conflict, particularly focusing on the dynamics of power and status in organizational settings.

We combine measurement and governance branches of transaction cost theory to compare the efficiency of market intermediation by patent assertion entities to that of bilateral licensing agreements, patent pools, and firm integration. We consider the level of complementarity between patents and the breadth of their commercial applications to develop four general intellectual property configurations that depict distinct relationships between patent supply and patent demand. The costs and benefits of the various governance alternatives are then weighed for each configuration to identify when each alternative is likely to be most efficient. Our analysis suggests that patent assertion entities are most efficient in allocating intellectual property rights when there is substantial patent complementarity such that value is created through patent bundling, and these bundles are applicable across a broad range of product lines such that the costs of measuring infringement and its damages are substantial. We consider how the imperfections of patents as contracts between inventors and society in conjunction with rapid technological evolution contribute to the growth of patent assertion entities.

The standard organizational responses to detrimental public policies examined in the literature include exiting the market altogether, attempting to change the public policy through various political strategies, or passively complying with the policy. However, these responses might not be suitable when a detrimental policy is likely to be reversed. In this paper, I consider organizational dormancy, which entails a temporary reduction in an organization\u2019s level of activity, as a viable alternative response. I propose that some organizations might be able to undergo a period of strategic inactivity in response to the onset of a detrimental public policy and maintain this inactivity until a favorable public policy returns. I also propose that such dormancy is rewarded when the favorable policy returns. An investigation of a panel of private commercial banks in the Indian banking industry from 1981 to 2004 lends support to this proposal.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.1027","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['public policy', 'strategic response', 'organizations']","The article discusses organizational responses to detrimental public policies, which touches on ethical considerations in business practices.

Our findings, based on a dataset of start-ups in the semiconductor industry over a 10-year period (1997\u20132007), show that user-industry spinouts are more likely both to enter and to survive in market-specific product categories.

In contrast to the common view that firms should match their organizational form to the prevailing nature of technology, vertically integrated firms may rationally choose to stay integrated and bear the sunk costs of developing integrative capabilities as well as the ongoing costs of maintaining them, even when they lose money during some time periods due to competition from lower cost specialized firms. In particular, in industries characterized by successive systemic innovations, which entail interdependence across stages of production, some firms may remain vertically integrated to maintain their capability to innovate over multiple cycles of technological innovation.

We show that although the attendance award had direct, positive effects on employees who previously had punctuality problems, it also led to strategic gaming behavior centered on the specific eligibility criteria for the award. The award program temporarily changed behavior in award-eligible workers but did not habituate improved attendance. Furthermore, we show that the extrinsic reward from the award program crowded out the internal motivation of those employees who had previously demonstrated excellent attendance, generating worse punctuality during periods of ineligibility. Most novelly, we show that the attendance award program also crowded out internal motivation and performance in tasks not included in the award program. Workers with above average pre-program attendance lost 8% efficiency in daily laundry tasks after the program\u2019s introduction. We argue that these motivational spillovers result from the perceived inequity of internally motivated workers\u2019 previously unrewarded superior attendance contributions.

Switching Between Practices in Police Work","Fast-response organizations are under increased scrutiny as to their ability to mount a timely and coordinated response to unexpected events. Our inductive study focuses on a high profile murder that occurred in Amsterdam in 2011 where a large multidisciplinary police team faced major coordination challenges and was unsuccessful in switching from the practice of surveillance to that of apprehension when their target was suddenly gunned down. Our analysis suggests that challenges related to relational ambiguity, knowledge flows, communications technology, team composition, and field obstructions, hindered the switching between practices under conditions of surprise and fast response.

We operationalize front-loading and back-loading and test our propositions using primary data on 2,711 instances of method use in 116 transfers of 37 organizational practices in 8 companies.

Based on a sample of 482 U.S. biotech companies, we find that VCs encourage their investees to pursue risky and novel innovations in the early stage of a new venture, but discourage them from doing so in the late stage of the venture. Furthermore, structurally powerful CEOs, who are in a position to take greater risks, intensify the positive effect of VC funding on innovation novelty in the early stage of a venture. However, such CEOs attenuate the negative effect of VC funding on innovation novelty in the late stage of the venture. In contrast, CEOs whose power derives from their innovation-related expertise typically seek a more balanced approach to innovation. Such CEOs attenuate both the positive effect of VC funding on innovation novelty in the early stage of a venture and the negative effect of VC funding on innovation novelty in the late stage of the venture.

Analysts\u2019 forward-looking performance forecasts can serve as powerful motivation for managers, but may also encourage them to undertake short-term actions detrimental to future competitiveness and performance. To identify whether managerial reactions to earnings pressure suggest evidence of intertemporal trade-offs, we explored how companies respond to earnings pressure under different conditions of corporate governance that shape the temporal orientations of managers. Using data on competitive decisions made by U.S. airlines under quarterly earnings pressure, we examined the effect of earnings pressure on competitive behavior under different ownership structures (ownership by long-term dedicated investors versus transient investors) and CEO incentives (unvested incentives that are restricted or unexercisable in the short term, versus vested incentives). The results suggest that companies with more long-term-oriented investors and long-term-aligned CEOs with unvested incentives are less likely to soften competitive behavior in response to earnings pressure, relative to companies with transient investors and CEOs with vested, immediately exercisable stock-based incentives. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) specification for stronger identification, we also found that firms respond to their rivals\u2019 earnings pressure shocks by increasing capacity and prices, particularly when those rivals do not have long-term-oriented investors and CEO incentives.

Here, we build on recent work on status conflict in investigating the prevalence and consequences of situations in which group members hold differing perceptions of the status ordering\u2014that is, of who ranks where\u2014which we call status disagreement. Across two studies of interacting groups, we examined several different types of status disagreement and found that disagreements in which two group members both viewed themselves as higher in status than the other, or upward disagreements, were uniquely harmful for groups. These types of disagreements led the involved members to reduce their contributions to the group, substantially decreasing group performance. However, other forms of dyadic status disagreements, as well as overall levels of status consensus, did not significantly affect group functioning. Furthermore, we found that individuals higher in personality dominance were those most likely to be involved in these harmful upward disagreements. These findings demonstrate the importance of more thoroughly considering status disagreement as a dimension that can vary in quantity and type across groups.

Adopting a performative perspective, we compare the connecting of such actants and study how they are engaged in routine performances. We relate observed differences in the generativity of routine interactions to whether actants become mediators or intermediaries. Whereas intermediaries merely maintain connections between routines, mediators can modify them when performing routine connections. We identify three generative effects mediators can lead to: (1) the creation of innovative outcomes, (2) the adaptation of existing routine performances, and/or (3) the emergence of new routine performances.

Within this context, standard routines can be seen as a solution to problems of inefficiency within organizations, especially when associated with images of stability, repeatability, and standardization. This can bring a sense of order where there is disorder, and stability in the face of change. However, whereas standard routines may be seen as providing solutions within complex and ever-changing organizational worlds, they can also be viewed as sources of organizational problems. Through an ethnographic examination of two routines within a newspaper-printing factory, our paper seeks to build on and add to contributions within routine dynamics (RD) by highlighting the emergence and coexistence of change and stability and the enactment of standard routines through a performative process of difference and repetition. In particular, our paper examines how organizational stability and change emerge through the dynamic relations underlying the enactment of difference and repetition and how these relations involve various\u2014sometimes hidden\u2014microprocesses that include the simplification and amplification of facts, scripts, and concerns.

Specifically, whereas reflective spaces are set apart by social, physical, and temporal boundaries and involve interactions that are geared toward developing novel conceptualizations of a routine, experimental spaces enable the integration of new actions into routine performances by locating them within the original routine, while establishing symbolic and temporal boundaries that signal the provisional and localized nature of experimental performances. As both types of spaces contribute to achieving change in complementary ways, they need to be enacted iteratively in relation to each other. The study offers a model of intentional routine change that articulates the role of spaces in interrupting and reorienting their recursive dynamics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.1041","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['change', 'routines', 'spaces', 'social', 'performance']","The article discusses the concept of changing routines within organizations, which implies a focus on social dynamics and performance improvement.

It explains why single routines are grouped into clusters and how complementarities between the specialized routines of a cluster will affect its evolution. It is the main argument of this paper that, in contrast to the expanding dynamics of single routines, which continuously bring about variations, the dynamics of clusters are restricting, amounting to a selection mechanism in organizational practice. To illustrate and substantiate our argument, we use a historical case study on CEWE, the European market leader in photofinishing.

Second, each intersection amplifies pressure toward one or the other ostensive pattern thus introducing dynamism into the balancing of competing ostensive patterns. Third, professionals skillfully acknowledge these pressures from intersecting routines to orient toward one ostensive pattern and then reorient the performance of the routine toward the opposite ostensive pattern.

We address this question through an ethnographic case study analyzing how a catastrophe management organization enacts routines in a highly dynamic setting. Our findings first of all reveal that patterns described by the participants as either stable or flexible were nevertheless both performed differently in each iteration of the routine. Our microlevel analysis shows that to enact patterns that participants perceive as stable, participants had to carry out specific aligning and prioritizing activities that lock-stepped performances. In contrast, participants perceive patterns as flexible when they enact specific selecting and recombining activities. Building on these observations, we add to extant routine literature by (1) differentiating between stability, standardization, flexibility, and change of routines and by (2) providing new insights on mindfulness in accounting for the microlevel activities enacted to orient toward a pattern that enhances standardization or flexibility in dynamic contexts.

Advancing prior research on routine dynamics, this study examines how inertia in routines influences the process of organizational adaptation, both in the absence and presence of endogenous change of routines. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis suggests an overlooked mechanism by which routine-level inertia may help, rather than hinder, organization-level adaptation. We demonstrate this mechanism by using a simple theoretical model in which the organization is characterized as a configuration of interdependent routines and study the process by which this configuration adapts to cope with its task environment. We find that inertia in routines may engender potentially useful variation in the process of organizational adaptation because reduced rates of routine-level changes may lead to temporal reordering when these changes are implemented. In our nuanced perspective, inertia is not only a consequence of adaptation or selection as perceived in prior research, but also a source of variation that turns out to be useful for adaptation. This logic is helpful to better understand why apparently inertial organizations keep surviving and from time to time exhibit outstanding performance. We conclude by discussing how this advanced understanding of the role of routines in organizational adaptation helps elaborate the theory of economic evolution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1059","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational adaptation', 'inertia', 'routines']","The article primarily focuses on organizational dynamics and adaptation without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We argue that offshoring firms must accumulate architectural knowledge to keep the cost of coordination of the geographically separated activities at bay. Based on a simulation model that examines the performance implications of firms\u2019 learning strategies when offshoring, we show that such knowledge accumulation can be achieved through either a home-based or a host-based learning strategy. Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategies depends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication, the distance to the offshoring location, and the level of noise in the firm\u2019s performance function. In particular, the difficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are benefits of making changes to the configuration after the offshoring implementation (host-based learning). In contrast, when coordination costs and distance dominate, the strategy of gearing the organization for offshoring prior to separating them across country borders prevails (home-based learning). Thus, by formalizing these two learning strategies for acquiring architectural knowledge in offshoring, we show that important contingencies can lead to significant performance trade-offs in the search for new organizational configurations that span international borders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1060","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['offshoring', 'coordination', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on economic benefits and performance implications of offshoring strategies, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Social Networking Strategies for Unproven (and Proven) Technologies","The academic literature on technology battles has grown rapidly since the 1970s, tracking the ever-expanding role of information and communication technologies in our daily lives. An intriguing thread in this literature pertains to the influence of social networks on standards setting processes. While scholars acknowledge networks\u2019 importance, their relevance to sponsors\u2019 efforts to diffuse their technologies and establish them as de facto standards have been neglected. We theorize that sponsors choose alliance partners according to their location in the networks that connect potential adopters and that the network position that enhances a partner\u2019s attractiveness depends on a technology\u2019s stage of development. We hypothesize that sponsors of technologies that are early in their development and unproven commercially choose partners to create multiple points of contact between previous and potential adopters, called wide bridges. These redundant ties can foster the broad acceptance of a new technology that is essential to drive its diffusion. Sponsors of technologies in later stages of their development, with a commercial track record, can rely on a sparser network of ties to activate peer-to-peer diffusion. In line with our predictions, we found that during the battle to establish a 2G wireless standard in the U.S. market, Qualcomm, sponsor of the unproven CDMA (code division multiple access) technology, formed alliances that conformed to a wide-bridge pattern, while Ericsson, sponsor of the proven TDMA (time division multiple access) technology, formed alliances consistent with a peer-to-peer pattern of diffusion.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1063","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of technology diffusion and networking strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We contribute to this research by studying how the effect of firm age on the quality of explorative and exploitative innovations is affected by the firm-specific and industry tenure of the talent resources (employees) that the firm utilizes. We start with the baseline predictions that firm age is related to the development of better exploitative innovations and worse explorative innovations. However, the tenure of employees intervenes in these relationships, by way of bringing in new knowledge, mental models, and beliefs. We predict that longer firm-specific and industry tenure of employees enhances the positive effect of firm age on the quality of exploitative innovations, while amplifying the negative effect of firm age on the quality of explorative innovations. In addition, for both the baseline and the moderating effect, we also formulate a prediction comparing the quality of explorative innovations with those of exploitative innovations. We find support for the moderating effects of human capital tenure for the quality of explorative innovations, but not for the quality of exploitative innovations. We reason that the latter may be due to the need for some level of exploration even in exploitative innovations, at least in the setting we study\u2014the video game industry.

This phenomenon challenges theory that suggests analogies work best when elements from a source and target domain map closely to each other. To develop a theory that explains how organizations make initially imperfect analogies \u201cwork,\u201d we use a case study of online advertising exchanges, a market-inspired model for buying and selling online advertising space. We find that as organizations stretch an initially misfitting exchange analogy from financial markets to online advertising, they iteratively bend their activities in superficial, structural, and generative ways to match the analogy and position themselves for advantage in the new space being created. Whereas prior studies emphasize shared cognition about familiar domains as the reason why analogies work, our study offers a dynamic account in which stretching, bending, and positioning combine to not only establish the financial market analogy but also subtly change the understanding of markets.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1069","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['analogies', 'financial markets', 'online advertising']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of using financial market analogies in online advertising without addressing any social justice or ethical themes.

We add to this work by examining how \u201ceducational mismatch\u201d\u2014when a job does not utilize the skills an employee has acquired during education\u2014relates to subsequent transitions into entrepreneurship. While prior research has focused on mismatch due to labor market frictions, workers may also enter mismatches for other reasons, such as family obligations or a change in career interests. Different reasons, in turn, may relate in distinct ways to wages and job satisfaction and thus to the opportunity costs of entering entrepreneurship. Moreover, mismatch may also affect human capital development, including the formation of a broader range of skills that is beneficial in entrepreneurship. Using longitudinal data from over 25,000 scientists and engineers, we document a broad range of reasons for educational mismatch and show that the relationships between educational mismatch and wages, job satisfaction, and skill variety differ significantly depending upon the reason for a mismatch. Mismatched individuals are more likely to enter into entrepreneurship in a subsequent period, an effect that goes beyond higher labor mobility per se. Both lower opportunity costs\u2014primarily low job satisfaction\u2014and greater skill variety appear to link educational mismatch to subsequent entrepreneurship.

I examine this dynamic in the context of Major League Baseball, where appreciation for traditional stadium features seemingly arose after the advent of free agency heightened awareness and coverage of the economic rewards in the sport. Experimental analysis validates the proposed mechanism, whereby increased fan exposure to extrinsic rewards increases concern about player inauthenticity, which increases preference for traditional stadium features. Quantitative analysis of attendance patterns provides external validation for these experimental findings by showing that authenticity was more highly preferred, in the form of higher relative attendance in traditional-style ballparks, by those fans more exposed to free agency.

We exploit the abundant data available in our research setting to investigate the heterogeneity in these factors across different types of open collaboration communities.

We argue that such structure affects termination in two ways: directly, through coordination, and indirectly, by shaping the interpretation of performance feedback. Our baseline models indicate that as performance increases above aspirations, the rate of phaseout decreases. We find that as performance declines below aspirations, the rate of phaseout decreases, but then increases when the product falls below a certain sales threshold. We also find evidence that centralization amplifies the feedback effect above aspirations but attenuates it below aspirations. This study links two pillars of the Carnegie school, aspiration levels and hierarchy, to explain the complexity of phaseout following perceived success or failure. We thereby augment the growing scholarship on performance feedback by considering some important conditional effects imposed by a centralized structure. Our focus on centralization expands the scope of theory concerning organization design by linking structure and cognition to explain firm behavior, especially termination decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1076","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational structure and performance feedback without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

The findings suggest that the impact of lower barriers to growth is shaped by the extent of the reduction in barriers to growth and the level of human capital of the individual. Only a large reduction in barriers to growth has a stronger impact in increasing the likelihood of founding at higher levels of human capital. I capitalize on two reforms lowering barriers to growth as natural experiments. One reform, in 1988, only slightly lowered barriers to growth. The second reform, in 1999, more strongly lowered barriers to growth with an amendment to the Chinese constitution reversing regulations that favored firms with foreign investors. This made it easier for domestic entrepreneurs to compete. I collected data through a survey of 2,966 alumni who graduated from a top Chinese university.

By comparing six longitudinal cases of large firms\u2019 new business initiatives, we find that corporate businesses that scale undergo a graduation process in which they meet the varying expectations of multiple organizational resource providers.

At the corporate level, the new units demonstrate their value by adding strategic capabilities that complement those of their main organizations. They initially integrate with their corporate parents to ensure resource flows, but then differentiate themselves to develop their own strategic profile. We contribute to the ambidexterity literature by unpacking the triggers, conditions, and interaction patterns that allow exploratory units to scale.

In contrast, achieved political connections are more likely to serve a binding function that facilitates donation, particularly in state-monopolized industries and more market-oriented regions, but in less market-oriented regions, they buffer firms from the pressure to donate.

As a result, conflict frequently arises. Given the profound impact of conflict on group effectiveness, scholars have sought to identify strategies that can mitigate its downsides and leverage its upsides. Yet research on conflict management strategies has accumulated inconsistent results. In this Perspectives piece, we argue that these inconsistent findings can be resolved if scholars take a more expansive view of the consequences of conflict management strategies: whereas existing research considers how individual strategies influence a single group conflict type (relational, status, process, or task), we consider the impact of individual strategies on all four conflict types. After building a typology by organizing strategies according to the conflict type that each is best equipped to manage, we argue that the strategies most appropriate for managing one type of conflict may systematically backfire by escalating other conflict types. For example, the adoption of a superordinate identity is likely to resolve relational conflict, yet exacerbate status conflict.

We reexamine this axiom by exploring the relationship between excess control rights and performance outcomes in business groups. Using a sample of 106 Taiwanese business groups, we confirm that the effects of excess control in business groups are double edged, such that group-level excess control exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with group performance. At the same time, results show that when group-level excess control is high, there is a stronger negative relationship between firm-level excess control and firm performance. Moreover, the study indicates that the detrimental effect of excess control is less pronounced in business groups that are governed by family members or by professional managers. Findings offer a far deeper view than previously proposed on the excess control phenomenon in business groups, and the need to distinguish firm performance from group performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1086","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of control rights and performance outcomes in business groups without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Second, because the tendency toward immediate results could reflect stock market pressures, we consider how the interaction of investor patience and firm horizon relates to firm performance. Third, we examine the argument\u2019s implication that most firms have investment horizons at a level where marginal increases in horizon associate positively with firm performance. Measuring horizon as the expected useful lives of capital expenditures, we find empirical support for the hypothesized quadratic relation in a large-scale, multiyear sample of U.S. publicly held manufacturing firms and confirm that a majority of firms have horizons in the region where our models predict increases in horizon positively influence performance.

We argue that while equity is conducive to uncertain exploration critical for innovation, debt provides countervailing incentives for engaging in exploitation by imposing cash flow obligations and the threat of bankruptcy. As a consequence, debt becomes a vital instrument in directing innovation along the optimal trajectory, while preventing the balance from shifting too far toward suboptimal exploration. To support our arguments, drawing on patent data, we first demonstrate that a firm\u2019s leverage is positively related to knowledge exploitation activity as reflected in its self-citations. Next, we show that firms that have potentially engaged in suboptimal exploration, as manifest in underutilized stocks of proprietary knowledge, are likely to experience leverage increases in the short run, and these leverage increases in turn result in subsequent increases in self-citations. These effects are consistent with firm value indicating that equity holders value the role of debt in stimulating exploitation. Our study draws attention to the complementary roles of equity and debt as governance mechanisms in balancing exploration/exploitation, while outlining the role of debt in innovation in greater depth.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1089","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on financial mechanisms and their impact on innovation, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

But research on this process has yet to fully account for two critical realities underscored by recent research: (1) firms need to acquire resources from different groups of resource providers and (2) reputation is multidimensional. Drawing on the organizational reputation literature and on information processing theory, we propose that two groups of resource providers will respond differently to new firms\u2019 affiliations in accordance with differences in the groups\u2019 abilities to recognize and interpret reputation-related signals. We also propose that within a single group of resource providers, distinct characteristics of the affiliate will exert different influences. We test these propositions using longitudinal data from Belgian firms that affiliated with venture capital (VC) investors. Consistent with our predictions, we find that characteristics of a VC affiliate exert more influence on prospective financiers than on prospective employees. We further find that prospective financiers were more influenced by a VC\u2019s industry-specific experience than by its media prominence, whereas prospective employees were more influenced by a VC\u2019s media prominence than by its industry-specific experience. Taken together, the findings show that new firms\u2019 resource attraction trajectories are shaped by their affiliates in more complex ways than past research has accounted for.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1090","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['reputation', 'resource attraction', 'affiliates']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of resource attraction and reputation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Tertius Gaudens, Tertius Iungens, and the Temporality of Structural Holes","Organizational network research has demonstrated that multiple benefits accrue to people occupying brokerage positions. However, the extant literature offers scant evidence of the process postulated to drive such benefits (information brokerage) and therefore leaves unaddressed the question of how brokers broker. We address this gap by examining the information-brokerage interactions in which actors engage. We argue that the information-brokerage strategies of brokers differ in three critical ways from those of actors embedded in denser network positions. First, brokers more often broker information via short-term interactions with colleagues outside their network of long-term relationships, a process we label \u201cunembedded brokerage.\u201d Second, when they engage in unembedded brokerage, brokers are more likely than are actors in dense network positions to intermediate the flow of information between the brokered parties, consistent with a tertius gaudens strategy. Conversely, and third, when they broker information via their network of long-term ties (embedded brokerage), brokers are more likely than are densely connected actors to facilitate a direct information exchange between the brokered parties, consistent with a tertius iungens strategy. Using a relational event model, we find support for our arguments in an empirical analysis of email communications among employees in a medium-sized, knowledge-intensive organization, as well as in a replication study. The theory and evidence we present advance a novel, temporal perspective on how brokers broker, which reconciles structural and process views of network brokerage. Our findings substantiate the notion of brokers as a dynamic force driving change in organizational networks, and they help to integrate within a unitary explanatory framework tertius iungens and tertius gaudens views of brokerage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1091","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['brokerage', 'information', 'network', 'change']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of brokerage in organizational networks without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using panel data from the global smartphone industry and recent patent wars among key industry rivals, we examine how smartphone vendors that are not directly involved in patent litigation strategically respond to increased litigation risks in this industry. We find that as patent wars intensify, smartphone vendors not involved in any litigation focus more of their business in markets with weaker intellectual property (IP) protection because of institutional arbitrage opportunities. This strategic response is more pronounced for vendors whose stocks of patents are small and whose home markets have weak-IP systems.

The study demonstrates that, to craft new institutional practices, individual actors engage in two distinct layers of institutional work. One entails purposefully visible, staged, scripted, and carefully documented work to suspend existing institutions and allow for experimentation as well as to legitimize new practices. The second entails invisible, undocumented work to recruit allies, find resources, experiment with new practices, coordinate strategies of action, and build political toolkits. While visible work\u2014which is the focus of most research on institutional change\u2014was determinant at every stage of the change process because of its symbolic effects, actors spent most of their time and energy on invisible work, which they referred to as \u201cthe real work.\u201d The paper shows that every act of visible institutional work was crafted through considerable amounts of invisible institutional work. Since new practices and new symbols were crafted through gradual and iterative processes of experimentation, invisible work includes many failures that remain undocumented.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that in such an environment, participants tend to gradually increase their exposure to risk prior to the occurrence of the first adverse event, a tendency that has been attributed to a misleading evaluation of short-term outcomes. The principle of inhibition of goal-related content following goal attainment and a heuristic model of aspiration adaptation independently predict that the formation of a comprehensive intermediate goal system will produce a stable trade-off between safety and short-term profit. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the decisions of participants required to form such targets with those of a control group allocating resources directly. Our main findings are that this intervention attenuated, if not fully removed, the tendency to increase risk exposure over time and that it improved performance.

On one hand, the formation of modern pools can boost follow-on innovation by lowering the search, negotiation, and licensing costs associated with pooled standards. On the other hand, modern pools may decrease the incentives to invest in follow-on innovations because of cannibalization risks and grant-back provisions. To the extent that modern pools succeed in establishing a dominant standard, their collaborative nature and their reliance on markets for technology can reduce technological uncertainty and appropriation hazards, hence triggering vertical disintegration in related industries. Moreover, by establishing a dominant standard, modern pools can effectively diminish the relative importance of integrative capabilities inside firms. Employing a combination of empirical strategies, I show that the formation of seven major modern patent pools has, on average, increased the rate of follow-on innovations based on the pooled standards by about 14%. Moreover, the results suggest that the establishment of modern pools can facilitate a shift toward vertical disintegration in associated industries where upstream technology-focused organizations would disproportionally contribute to the development of follow-on complementary technologies. The results also suggest that modern pools reduce the relative importance of integrative capabilities and provide a more advantageous position for specialized startups vis-\u00e0-vis diversifying entrants.

I then examine the mechanisms for this decreased commercialization with a novel longitudinal survey of OSS community members.

Prosperous Times Have Immediate and Lasting Implications for CEO Misconduct","We examine whether prosperous economic times have both immediate and lasting implications for corporate misconduct among chief executive officers (CEOs). Drawing on research suggesting that prosperous times are associated with excessive risk-taking, overconfidence, and more opportunities to cheat, we first propose that CEOs will be more likely to engage in corporate misconduct during good economic times. Next, we propose that CEOs who begin their careers in prosperous times will be more likely to engage in self-serving corporate misconduct later in their careers. We tested these hypotheses by assembling a large data set of American CEOs and following their stock option reporting patterns between 1996 and 2005. We found that in good economic times, CEOs were more likely to backdate their stock options grants. Moreover, CEOs who began their careers in prosperous times were more likely to backdate stock option grants later in their careers. These findings suggest that the state of the economy can influence current ethical behavior and leave a lasting imprint on the moral proclivities of new workforce entrants.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2016.1101","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['misconduct', 'ethical behavior', 'corporate', 'prosperous times']","The article discusses the implications of economic prosperity on corporate misconduct, highlighting ethical behavior in leadership.

We develop a dynamic model of buying frenzies that incorporates the firm's manufacturing and sale of a product over time and characterizes the conditions under which inducing such frenzies is an optimal strategy. We find that buying frenzies occur when customers are sufficiently uncertain about their valuations of the product and when they discount the future sufficiently but not excessively. We propose measures of \u201ccustomer desperation\u201d and of the extent of scarcity to measure the depth and breadth of buying frenzies, respectively.

This article studies how the choice of appointment scheduling window affects a provider's operational efficiency. We use a single server queue to model the registered appointments in a provider's work schedule, and the capacity of the queue serves as a proxy of the size of the appointment window. The provider chooses a common appointment window for all patients to maximize her long\u2010run average net reward, which depends on the rewards collected from patients served and the \u201cpenalty\u201d paid for those who cannot be scheduled. Using a stylized M/M/1/K queueing model, we provide an analytical characterization for the optimal appointment queue capacity K, and study how it should be adjusted in response to changes in other model parameters. In particular, we find that simply increasing appointment window could be counterproductive when patients become more likely to show up. Patient sensitivity to incremental delays, rather than the magnitudes of no\u2010show probabilities, plays a more important role in determining the optimal appointment window. Via extensive numerical experiments, we confirm that our analytical results obtained under the M/M/1/K model continue to hold in more realistic settings. Our numerical study also reveals substantial efficiency gains resulted from adopting an optimal appointment scheduling window when the provider has no other operational levers available to deal with patient no\u2010shows. However, when the provider can adjust panel size and overbooking level, limiting the appointment window serves more as a substitute strategy, rather than a complement.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12401","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiency and technical modeling of appointment scheduling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, such a role remains relatively unexplored in competitive environments. In this study, we study equilibrium behavior of competing retailers in two settings: (i) when prices are exogenously fixed, and retailers compete in assortments only; and (ii) when retailers compete jointly in assortment and prices. For this, we model consumer choice using a multinomial Logit, and assume that each retailer selects products from a predefined set, and faces a display constraint. We show that when the sets of products available to retailers do not overlap, there always exists one equilibrium that Pareto\u2010dominates all others, and that such an outcome can be reached through an iterative process of best responses. A direct corollary of our results is that competition leads a firm to offer a broader set of products compared to when it is operating as a monopolist, and to broader offerings in the market compared to a centralized planner. When some products are available to all retailers, that is, assortments might overlap, we show that display constraints drive equilibrium existence properties.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12402","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product assortment and pricing in competitive environments without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2016","25","1","Howard Hao\u2010Chun Chuang, Rogelio Oliva, and Olga PerdikakiView all authors and affiliations","Traffic\u2010Based Labor Planning in Retail Stores","Staffing decisions are crucial for retailers since staffing levels affect store performance and labor\u2010related expenses constitute one of the largest components of retailers\u2019 operating costs.

On the one hand, continuous coding without adequate coordination can cause serious system inconsistencies and faults that may subsequently require significant corrective effort. On the other hand, frequent integrations can be disruptive to the team and delay development progress. This tradeoff motivates the need for a good coordination policy. Both the complexity and the importance of coordination is accentuated in distributed software development (DSD), where a software project is developed by multiple, geographically\u2010distributed sub\u2010teams. The need for coordination in DSD exists both within one sub\u2010team and across different sub\u2010teams. The latter type of coordination involves communication across spatial boundaries (different locations) and possibly temporal boundaries (different time zones), and is a major challenge that DSD faces.

While retailers employ cash registers to enter incoming orders and outgoing sales, inaccuracy arises because they do not record invisible demand such as spoilage, damage, pilferage, or returns.

Allowing for dependence between demand and invisible demand, we obtain the associated dynamic programming equation with an infinite\u2010dimensional state space, and reduce it to a simpler form by employing the concept of unnormalized probability. We develop an analytical upper bound on the optimal profit as well as an iterative algorithm for an approximate solution of the problem. We compare profits of the iterative solution and the myopic solution, and then to the upper bound. We see that the iterative solution performs better than the myopic solution, and significantly so in many cases. Furthermore, it gives a profit not far from the upper bound, and is therefore close to optimal.

We use data from an online DVD\u2010by\u2010mail firm to estimate the direct and indirect effects of inventory decisions, considering the circular relationship: Rental generates WOM, WOM creates Desire, and Desire turns into Rental.

To help inform this decision, we propose an approach where we compare the relative value of the segment of passengers who use an auxiliary service to the relative value of the segment that does not use it. We demonstrate this approach for a typical auxiliary service common to the airline industry. In 2008, most US airlines implemented checked baggage fee policies to decrease their costs by reducing the number of customer service agents needed in the check\u2010in and baggage handling processes. The success of this change has led to a current debate at many of these airlines on whether to make further staffing cuts in these areas, essentially making it even less attractive for passengers to check their baggage. Our proposed methodology helps answer whether passengers who continue to check bags in today's baggage\u2010fee era are more or less valuable than passengers who do not check bags. We explore this question empirically by examining, through a stated preference survey, if a history of checking or not checking bags can be used to segment passengers based on how their itinerary choices are influenced by common airline service attributes (on\u2010time performance, itinerary time, number of connections, airfare, and schedule delay). Contrary to the opinions of some top airline executives, we find that the passengers who continue to check bags at airlines that charge baggage fees are generally less sensitive to differences in three of these important service attributes and are less likely to switch airlines when a competing airline improves its offerings along these dimensions. Thus, airlines that charge for checked bags should consider improving the customer experience for their bag\u2010checking passengers, as they represent a potentially more valuable segment class to the airline.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12569","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiency and customer segmentation in the airline industry without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

It enables firms to continue operating while finding a solution to an unexpected event that causes a supply disruption or demand surge. While extremely valuable when actually deployed, stockpiles incur large holding costs and usually provide no benefits until such a time. To help to reduce this cost, this study presents a new approach for managing stockpiles. We show that if leveraged intelligently, stockpiles can also help an organization better meet its own regular demand by enabling a type of virtual pooling we call virtual stockpile pooling (VSP). The idea of VSP is to first integrate the stockpile into several locations\u2019 regular inventory buffers and then dynamically reallocate the stockpile among these locations in reaction to the demand realizations to achieve a kind of virtual transshipment. To study how to execute VSP and determine when it can provide the most value, we formulate a stylized multi\u2010location stochastic inventory model and solve for the optimal stockpile allocation and inventory order policies. We show that VSP can provide significant cost savings: in some cases nearly the full holding cost of the stockpile (i.e., VSP effectively maintains the stockpile for free), in other cases nearly the savings of traditional physical inventory pooling. Last, our results prescribe implementing VSP with many locations for large stockpiles, but only a few locations for small stockpiles.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12573","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory optimization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In computing entropy flow dominance (EFD), we aggregate information embedded in the routings of all products within a system into a single measure. EFD is designed to indicate on a 0\u20131 scale the level of flow dominance, where 1 represents a pure flow shop and 0 represents a pure job shop. The result is a simple measure that provides managers a way to explain and predict complex phenomena.

A social planner can discourage exit by offering appropriately designed subsidies. Ex ante subsidies defray the costs associated with making operations safer (e.g., funds to subsidize the purchase of safety equipment). Ex post subsidies mitigate the financial damages caused by an accident (e.g., funds to defray the cost of cleaning up a toxic spill). We consider a model where (i) firms have private information about their ability to improve reliability and (ii) reliability investments are unobservable. We demonstrate that when the social value of reliability outweighs the benefit of increased competition, it is optimal to offer ex ante subsidies alone (i.e., to subsidize the cost of making operations safer). Conversely, when the benefits of competition outweigh the benefits of reliability, a combination of ex ante and ex post subsidies is optimal (i.e., not only to subsidize safer operations, but also to share the costs of a potential accident).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12597","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['safety', 'subsidies', 'social planner']","The article discusses safety and social welfare in the context of operations management, which indicates some awareness of societal impacts.

Since gray markets are not officially sanctioned by the manufacturer, their existence is assumed to hurt the manufacturer. Yet manufacturers sometimes tolerate or even encourage gray market activities. We investigate the incentives of a manufacturer and its authorized retailer to engage in (or tolerate) gray markets. The firms need to consider the trade\u2010off between the positive effects of a gray market (price discrimination and cost savings) and the negative effects (cannibalization of sales and a loss in consumer valuation). Generally, gray markets can be categorized into two types: (i) a \u201clocal gray market,\u201d where a retailer diverts products to unauthorized sellers operating in the same region as the retailer; and, (ii) \u201cbootlegging,\u201d where the retailer diverts products to unauthorized sellers in another market where the manufacturer sells through a direct channel. We characterize the equilibrium in each type of gray market and identify conditions under which the retailer will divert products to the gray market. Incentive problems are more complicated when the retailer bootlegs and, in this case, we show that conflicting incentives may lead to the emergence of a gray market where both the manufacturer's and retailer's profits decrease.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12578","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on gray markets and their economic implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Using this method, we also derive a set of metatheorems that can help identify when a threshold or control\u2010band type stopping policy is optimal.

In some cases, our method also simplifies the analysis of some existing results. Moreover, the metatheorems we propose help identify sufficient conditions that yield simple optimal policies when such policies are not generally optimal. We demonstrate these benefits by applying our method to several optimal stopping problems frequently encountered in, for example, the operations, marketing, finance, and economics literatures. We note that with structural results, optimal\u2010stopping policies are easier to follow, describe, and compute and hence implement. They also help determine how a stopping policy should be adjusted in response to changes in the operational environment.

This study proposes a new choice model based on WTP, incorporating sequential decision making, where the products with positive utility of purchase are considered in the order of customer preference. We compare WTP\u2010choice model with the commonly used (multinomial) Logit model with respect to the underlying choice process, information requirement, and independence of irrelevant alternatives. Using WTP\u2010choice model, we find and compare equilibrium and centrally optimal prices and profits without considering inventory availability.

One of the interesting results with WTP\u2010choice model is the \u201cloose coupling\u201d of retailers in competition; prices are not coupled but profits are. That is, each retailer should charge the monopoly price as the collection of these prices constitute an equilibrium but each retailer's profit depends on other retailers' prices. Loose coupling fails with dependence of WTPs or dependence of preference on prices. Also, we show that competition among retailers facing dependent WTPs can cause price cycles under some conditions. We consider real\u2010life data on sales of yogurt, ketchup, candy melt, and tuna, and check if a version of WTP\u2010choice model (with uniform, triangle, or shifted exponential WTP distribution), standard or mixed Logit model fits better and predicts the sales better.

As a consequence, they urge to create incentives for their suppliers to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Contracts to provide these incentives are rarely observed in practice. If not totally absent, contracts may be incomplete, in that unforeseen contingencies or some CSR attributes that are difficult to measure may not be included in the contract. We show that incentives for CSR investments can also be provided through the supply chain structure, which consists of the distribution of ownership rights over the firms' assets of production, and involves horizontal and/or vertical alliances among supply chain members. Motivated by examples in agricultural contexts, this study adopts the property rights approach to study the impact of supply chain structures on the adoption of CSR activities. We show that the structure that best incentivizes CSR investments depends on the interaction between CSR vertical synergy, free\u2010riding, and countervailing power. One of the main findings is that the alliance between suppliers is beneficial only if the revenues generated by a downstream investment are sufficiently high. In fact, only in this case, the suppliers can appropriate a sufficiently large stake of the revenues generated downstream, thanks to their countervailing power. When the upstream investment costs become high, however, the suppliers will invest in CSR only if the downstream distributor is vertically integrated. The resulting structure of a cooperative will best incentivize CSR investments only if the CSR vertical synergy between the two tiers of the supply chain is sufficiently high.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12585","research article","POM","Operations Management","7","['corporate social responsibility', 'incentives', 'supply chain', 'environmental concerns']","The article discusses the integration of social and environmental concerns within business practices, particularly through corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chains.

When consumers are relatively impatient and reluctant to wait to buy later, group selling by manufacturers will take place only when the end product is relatively perishable, that is, product durability is low. However, if consumers are patient, that is, willing to wait, collaboration happens only when the end product is quite durable; for relatively perishable products the manufacturers sell their products separately.

Typically, the demand for remanufactured units is high and exceeds the supply early in a product's lifetime, and drops below the supply late in the lifetime. This supply\u2013demand imbalance motivates us to study a switching strategy to facilitate the decision\u2010making process. This strategy deploys a push mode at the early stage of a product's lifetime, which remanufactures scarce cores to stock to responsively satisfy the high demand, and switches to a pull mode as the product approaches obsolescence to accurately match the low demand with supply. In addition, the strategy further simplifies the decision\u2010making process by ignoring the impact of leftover cores at the end of each decision period. We show that the optimal policy of the switching strategy possesses a simple, multi\u2010dimensional base\u2010stock structure, which aims to remanufacture units from the i best\u2010quality categories up to the ith state\u2010independent base\u2010stock level.

One reason is that the effects of delivery time differentiation on the supply chain are not well understood. The BMW Group, for instance, has considered offering an express order option, where express orders bypass standard orders in the supply chain processes to achieve short delivery times. Express orders distort planning processes, increase operations cost, and increase the delivery times of standard orders, however the effects have not been quantified yet. This study analyzes the impact of express orders on the supply chain, when express orders are built\u2010to\u2010order. To understand the supply chain consequences of express orders better, we analyzed the relevant supply chain processes at BMW Group. We determine the effect that built\u2010to\u2010order express orders have on delivery times and on component demand. To analyze the effect of introducing express orders on expected delivery times and expected cost, we use queuing theory and derive expressions for the transient behavior of a discrete time batch queue. Our analyses indicate that many supply chain processes are only marginally affected. However, the orders to the suppliers become considerably more uncertain, which must be compensated by additional safety stock. Our results indicate that express orders can be an attractive option for BMW and other automotive companies.

The innovator firm can release information about its product when it begins developing the product or can guard information about its product until it introduces the product into the market.

Readmissions are expensive and often unnecessary, putting patients at risk and costing $15 billion annually in the United States alone. Currently, 17% of Medicare patients are readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of initial discharge with readmissions typically being more expensive than the original visit to the hospital. Recent legislation penalizes organizations with a high readmission rate. The medical literature conjectures that many readmissions can be avoided or mitigated by post\u2010discharge monitoring. To develop a good monitoring plan it is critical to anticipate the timing of a potential readmission and to effectively monitor the patient for readmission causing conditions based on that knowledge. This research develops new methods to empirically generate an individualized estimate of the time to readmission density function and then uses this density to optimize a post\u2010discharge monitoring schedule and staffing plan to support monitoring needs. Our approach integrates classical prediction models with machine learning and transfer learning to develop an empirical density that is personalized to each patient. We then transform an intractable monitoring plan optimization with stochastic discharges and health state evolution based on delay\u2010time models into a weakly coupled network flow model with tractable subproblems after applying a new pruning method that leverages the problem structure. Using this multi\u2010methodologic approach on two large inpatient datasets, we show that optimal readmission prediction and monitoring plans can identify and mitigate 40\u201370% of readmissions before they generate an emergency readmission.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12377","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['patient risk', 'monitoring', 'health-care organizations']","The article focuses primarily on technical methods to reduce hospital readmissions and optimize resource allocation, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Periodically, or at the beginning of some selling season, the firm needs to distribute finished goods to a set of stocking locations, which, in turn, supply customer demands. Over the selling season, if and when there is a supply\u2010demand mismatch somewhere, a re\u2010distribution or transshipment will be needed. Hence, there are two decisions involved: the one\u2010time stocking decision at the beginning of the season and the supply/transshipment decision throughout the season. Applying a stochastic dynamic programming formulation to a two\u2010location model with compound Poisson demand processes, we identify the optimal supply/transshipment policy and show that the optimal initial stocking quantities can be obtained via maximizing a concave function whereas the contribution of transshipment is of order square\u2010root\u2010of T. Hence, in the context of high\u2010volume, fast\u2010moving products, the initial stocking quantity decision is a much more important contributor to the overall profit.

This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that examines the interrelationships between the elements of work design, project integration challenges, and project performance. We identify two distinct elements of work design in technology projects: (i) the type of project organization based on whether a technology project spans a firm boundary (Domestic\u2010Outsourcing) or a country boundary (Offshore\u2010Insourcing) or both boundaries (Offshore\u2010Outsourcing) or no boundaries (Domestic\u2010Insourcing), and (ii) the joint coordination practices among key stakeholders in a technology project\u2014namely, Onsite Ratio and Joint\u2010Task Ownership. Next, we measure the effectiveness of project integration using integration glitches that capture the incompatibility among interdependent task modules during project integration. Based on analysis of data from 830 technology projects, the results highlight the differential effects of distributed project organizations on integration glitches. Specifically, we find that project organizations that span both firm and country boundaries (Offshore\u2010Outsourcing) experience significantly higher levels of integration glitches compared to domestic project organizations (Domestic\u2010Outsourcing and Domestic\u2010Insourcing). The results further indicate that the relationship between project organization type and integration glitches is moderated by the extent of joint coordination practices in a project. That is, managers can actively lower integration glitches by increasing the levels of onsite ratio and by promoting higher levels of joint\u2010task ownership, particularly in project organization types that span both firm and country boundaries (Offshore\u2010Outsourcing).

By contrast, we analytically determine the time intervals where it is optimal to preempt and those where it is optimal to wait, and find that in some cases the provider should in fact stay idle, even in the presence of waiting patients. Our results suggest that the proposed analytical method outperforms the always\u2010preempt policy in clinics that do not overbook and have service times longer than 30 minutes. In these cases, the analytical method dramatically reduces patient waiting times at the cost of a modest increase in overtime.

Our study finds that the brand owner's optimal choice between the two quality management approaches could be opposite in the two supply chains. Specifically, we show that if agency costs exist between the contract manufacturer and the brand owner, the brand owner may prefer an inspection\u2010based approach in the multi\u2010level supply chain in contrast to preferring an external failure\u2010based approach in the dyadic supply chain. In particular, inspections can be effective for the brand owner to limit the manufacturer's profit by excluding defective finished products and components, which in turn reduce agency costs in the multi\u2010level supply chain. Hence, the efficiency of an inspection\u2010based approach relative to an external failure\u2010based approach can be higher in the multi\u2010level supply chain as compared to the dyadic one.

Study 1 uses three single\u2010shot decision experiments to establish that all three types of framing effects identified by Levin et al. (1998) apply in basic inventory control contexts. Results were consistent with theory in all three cases. Given this evidence that framing effects have potential to impact inventory control decisions, two laboratory experiments in Study 2 utilize multi\u2010period decision tasks to demonstrate that framing effects can impact performance in a dynamic inventory decision setting similar to practice. One of the experiments in Study 2 was conducted with student subjects, while the other with inventory managers from a large retail firm. Results from both experiments provide evidence that even when initial framing effects on order quantities fade, there can be longer term effects on inventory levels and performance. Furthermore, these effects are robust to education and professional experience. The findings suggest that although a manager might select appropriate inventory control metrics, prudence must be exercised in the presentation of these metrics, and that mere presentation can be used to alleviate known human biases in inventory control decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12430","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on decision framing effects in inventory control without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

First, we identify and define a set of salient risks in federal technology projects\u2014specifically, complexity risk and contracting risk in the planning process, and execution risk in the execution process. Next, we investigate whether higher levels of process maturity, assessed by the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework, mitigate the negative effect of project risks on project performance. The analysis of time\u2010series data collected from 82 federal technology projects across 519 quarterly time periods indicates that each of the three types of risks has a significant negative effect on project performance. This finding highlights the practical significance of managing these risks in the federal technology project context. Further, we find that increasing levels of process maturity attenuate the negative effect of project risks on the performance of federal technology projects. However, the attenuation effects are consequential only at high levels of project risks; at low levels of project risk, increasing levels of process maturity can adversely affect project performance. To demonstrate the financial implications of increasing process maturity levels in federal technology projects, we examine the magnitude of project cost savings (and overruns) across different levels of CMMI and project risks. In summary, our study contributes to the sparse literature on public sector operations by addressing the understudied context of federal technology projects, and provides a nuanced examination of the implications of process maturity in managing the risk to performance relationship in such projects.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12513","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on risk management and process maturity in federal technology projects without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Conformance quality measures the level of caregivers' adherence to evidence\u2010based standards of care while experiential quality measures the level of interaction between caregivers and patients. Hospitals operate in regulated environments characterized by heavy top\u2010down control mechanisms that are conducible for improving conformance quality. However, mechanisms that propel experiential quality, which emerges from the operational\u2010level interactions between caregivers and patients, remain unclear. This study employs a two\u2010phase multi\u2010method research to investigate this issue. The first phase uses qualitative data from five U.S. acute care hospitals involving 49 semi\u2010structured interviews and develops hypotheses on the effect of bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down decision processes on hospitals' ability to simultaneously improve on conformance and experiential quality. These hypotheses are then tested and refined using secondary data for a sample of 3,124 U.S. acute care hospitals between the years of 2006 and 2012. Results from the case analyses suggest that Magnet status, a sign of bottom\u2010up decision processes, is associated with hospitals' ability to improve on both conformance and experiential quality. However, hospitals' administrative intensity, which relates to top\u2010down decision processes, appears to mitigate the effect of Magnet status on simultaneous improvement. Testing this framework using large\u2010scale secondary data supports the positive effect of Magnet status on simultaneous improvement. However, we do not find support for a negative moderating effect of administrative intensity. A follow\u2010up analysis reveals that this moderation is in fact curvilinear (inverted U\u2010shape), which indicates that a moderate level of administrative intensity is most beneficial to the relationship between Magnet status and simultaneous improvement.

These projects use different strategies to search for technological solutions. Projects refining existing products, processes, and technologies, for instance, employ a local search strategy to improve performance, while projects developing new products, processes, and technologies employ a distant search strategy. However, projects can shift in their levels of complexity due to exogenous technological changes, and failure to change search strategy in turn can negatively impact project performance. This study first develops grounded theory via case studies to understand how high\u2010tech organizations manage R&D projects when complexity shifts. The case data come from 142 informants in 12 R&D projects at three high\u2010tech business units. A cross\u2010case comparison shows that three interconnected mechanisms positioned at multiple levels within the organization enable high\u2010tech organizations to identify such shifts and adjust the project's search. We refer to this strategy as responsive search. We then conduct agent\u2010based simulation experiments to examine the conditions under which the responsive search outperforms other canonical search strategies.

Such managers often have unique insights into the demand patterns at their local sites that can help inform how much inventory to order for the system as a whole. Problems can arise with this setup, however, if these managers have incentives to misreport their forecasts and the central planner (CP), in turn, mistrusts this information. The goal of our research is to shed light on the existence, magnitude, and causes of such coordination problems using a combination of analytical models and behavioral experiments. The analytical analysis reveals that incentives are misaligned in this setting and no truth\u2010telling equilibrium exists in general, unless inventory competition or demand uncertainty is removed. With this theoretical grounding, we conduct a series of controlled laboratory experiments to test the magnitude of these problems and how they are impacted by inventory competition, strategic concerns regarding the other parties, and the demand environment. We find that inventory competition and market uncertainty harm the efficacy of forecast sharing and channel efficiency, while the possibility that untrustworthy reports are detected (identical local demand information) does not deter regional managers from misreporting their forecasts. Removing strategic concerns regarding the CP (automating the central ordering decision) does not improve profit but reduces order variability. Information sharing appears to be a dominant policy as it significantly improves profit in all treatments compared with no information sharing.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12418","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['information sharing', 'trust', 'incentives']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory decisions, with minimal reference to social justice or ethical considerations.

This study empirically investigates relationships between perceptual measures of product modularity, process modularity, and new product introduction performance and explores whether an objective product/process complexity measure moderates these relationships. Using survey\u2010based methodology we probe both manufacturers of technically simple products and technically complex products. Hierarchical regression models are used to test hypotheses concerning the main effects of product and process modularity and the effects of their interactions with complexity on new product introduction performance. The results show that the main effect of product modularity was positive and its interaction with complexity was disordinal and negative, suggesting that the positive effect of product modularity on new product introduction performance is dampened when complexity is high. For process modularity, only the interaction effect (positive) was statistically significant and it was also disordinal in nature. Thus, the effect of process modularity on new product introduction performance is heightened when complexity is high. The implications of these findings are discussed and more specific theoretical and managerial implications are delineated by examining the impacts of these main and interaction effects on individual measures of new product introduction performance (frequency of new product introduction, product development lead times, product innovation, and on\u2010time product launch).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12495","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product and process modularity without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The franchisor chooses the contract terms (a one\u2010time franchise fee and a royalty rate for on\u2010going payments). The entrepreneur dynamically decides when to sign this contract, open a store, and apply for debt financing to cover the initial investment. In response to the entrepreneur's application, banks competitively determine loan rates. We find that the franchisor should use royalty cash flows and not the franchise fee to extract value from the entrepreneur. This is a new explanation of empirical evidence that franchise contracts favor royalties over franchise fees. To account for the possibility of the entrepreneur's bankruptcy and bankruptcy costs, the franchisor should decrease the royalty rate. However, despite a lower rate, the threshold for the entrepreneur to open the store is higher in the model with financing than in the model without financing. This threshold is much higher than it would have been for the integrated system, which in turn is higher than the static break\u2010even\u2010NPV threshold. If a franchisor ignores financing considerations, she will suffer from having to wait longer for the store opening and from a higher bankruptcy probability.

We model the system as an infinite\u2010horizon Markov decision process under the average cost criterion. A control policy specifies when a batch of components should be produced, and whether an arriving demand for each product should be satisfied. Previous work has shown that a lattice\u2010dependent base\u2010stock and lattice\u2010dependent rationing (LBLR) policy is an optimal stationary policy for a special case of the ATO model presented here (the generalized M\u2010system).

Remarkably, LBLR yields the globally optimal cost in each of more than 22,500 instances of the general problem, outperforming SBSR and FBFR with respect to both objective value (by up to 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively) and computation time (by up to three orders and one order of magnitude, respectively) in 350 of these instances (those on which we compare the heuristics).

Because expedited shipments increase the supplier's transportation cost, and possibly production/inventory costs, the supplier typically charges a markup over and above the prevailing wholesale price for fast\u2010shipped items. When fast shipping is not supported, items are backordered if customers are willing to wait until the start of the next replenishment period. We characterize the retailers and the supplier's optimal stocking and production policies and then utilize our analytical framework to study how the two players respond to changes in supply chain parameters. We identify a sufficient condition such that the centralized supply chain is better off with the fast\u2010ship option. We find a range of markups for fast\u2010ship orders such that the fast\u2010ship option is preferred by both the supplier and the retailer in a decentralized chain. However, a markup that is a win\u2013win for both players may not exist even when offering fast\u2010ship option is better for the centralized chain. Our analysis also shows that depending on how the markup is determined, greater customer participation in fast\u2010ship orders does not necessarily imply more profits for the two players. For some predetermined markups, the retailer's profit with the fast\u2010ship option is higher when more customers are willing to wait. However, the retailer may not be able to benefit from the fast\u2010ship option because the supplier may choose not to support the fast\u2010ship option when fast\u2010ship participation increases due to the fact that the fast\u2010ship participation rate adversely affects the initial order size.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12499","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model of supply chain management without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In an extension, we also study a branding model, where the incumbent firm, in addition to pricing, can also invest in influencing market preference for its product. With these models, we study conditions under which the incumbent firm may block the entrant (i.e., prevent entry without any market actions), deter the entrant (i.e., stop entry with suitable market actions) or accommodate the entrant (i.e., allow entry and compete), and how the entrant will allocate its limited capacity across its own and the new market, if entry occurs. We also study the timing difference between the two different dynamics of the price competition models and find that the incumbent's first\u2010mover advantage benefits both the incumbent and the entrant. Interestingly, the entrant firm's profits are not monotonically increasing in its capacity even when it is costless to build capacity. In the branding model, we show that in some cases, the incumbent may even increase its price and successfully deter entry by investing in consumer's preference for its product.

However, when the total spectrum resource is large, femtocell service offers significant competition to macrocell service and, as a result, the macrocell operator has less incentive to enable femtocell service.

Toward addressing this criticism, this study evaluates the delivery of behavioral health care as a part of primary care operations. Focusing on the treatment of depression, the study results show that: (i) primary care clinics operating in communities with superior social environment characteristics are associated with improved depression outcomes in the short term, and (ii) psychosocial resources (social and emotional support) and the built environment (man\u2010made resources and infrastructure to support human activity) of primary care clinics are associated with sustaining the improvement in depression outcome in the long term.

We also find that the effect of improving the affordability of behavioral health care delivery depends on the community's socioeconomic status. Primary care clinics in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities practicing cost\u2010containment are associated with improvements in depression outcomes, and, therefore, can contribute toward reducing disparities in behavioral health care delivery.

Reducing the response time to provide relief items to disaster victims and cost minimization are two important objectives of this study. We propose an integrated optimization model for simultaneously determining (1) locations of staging areas, (2) inventory assignments to these SAs, (3) selecting sizes and numbers of trucks, and (4) routing of trucks from SAs to PODs. We also introduce another variable, a value function, which forces the model to reduce the logistics response time. We study the interactions among these variables through extensive sensitivity analysis. The time horizon for supply of relief items to disaster areas is usually limited to six days after the disaster occurs. Therefore, we use the proposed optimization model in a rolling\u2010horizon manner, one day at a time. This reduces daily demand uncertainty. We analyze three disaster scenarios: (1) a low impact disaster, (2) a medium impact disaster, and (3) a high impact disaster. We conduct 720 experiments with different parameter values, and provide answers to the following questions that are useful for the logistic managers: (i) What are the right sizes (in terms of storage capacities) of SAs closer to the PODs? (ii) How should the budget be allocated in a disaster scenario? (iii) What mix of different types (in terms of sizes) of trucks should be selected in a given scenario? The most important managerial insights include: (i) operational budget beyond a limit does not improve the operational efficiency, (ii) when the budget is very low, it is essential to select smaller SAs close to the PODs in order to carry out operations in a feasible manner, (iii) when the impact of disaster is high, it is always beneficial to select larger SAs close to the PODs (as long as the budget is not very low), (iv) when the budget is high and the impact of disaster is not very high, the emergency management administrators need to select SAs prudently based on the tradeoff between the operational cost and the humanitarian value, and (v) the cost of operations is higher when all the trucks are of the same type compared to the case when there is a mix of different types of trucks. Also, we find that the optimal selection of SAs is not impacted by different combinations of the types of trucks. The focus of this study is on disasters that can be forecasted in advance and provide some lead time for preparations, for example, hurricanes.

Through an illustrative example, we show that production subsidies of higher investment and production cost technologies (such as carbon capture and storage technologies) have no effect on the firm's optimal total capacity when firms own a portfolio of both clean and dirty technologies, but that investment subsidies of these technologies increase the firm's total capacity, conditionally increasing expected emissions.

The platform may charge two types of fees as in current practice: a reserve fee as a function of the seller's reserve price and a final value fee as a function of the sale's final trading price. We derive the optimality condition for fee policies, and show that the platform can use either just a final value fee or just a reserve fee to achieve optimality. In the former case, the optimal final value fee charged by the platform is independent of the number of buyers. In the latter case, the optimal reserve fee is often a decreasing, instead of increasing, function of the seller's reserve price. An increasing reserve fee may make the seller reluctant to use a positive reserve price and hurt the platform's revenue. In general, the optimal fees are nonlinear functions, but in reality, linear fees are commonly used because of their simplicity for implementation. We show that a linear fee policy is indeed optimal in the case that the seller's valuation follows a power distribution.

However, we show that the AS option can hurt the retailer's profit as well as supply chain performance. We identify two thresholds for a product's marginal production cost. A retailer's AS option benefits both the manufacturer and retailer when the marginal production cost is high, that is, above both thresholds. It benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer when the marginal production cost is moderate, that is, between the two thresholds. The result is ambiguous when the marginal production cost is low, that is, below both thresholds. We find that consumer valuation uncertainty under AS is the key driving force for the surprising result that having the retailer's AS option can hurt the retailer. When compared to the scenario where the retailer does not have the AS option, we find that the manufacturer's optimal wholesale price weakly decreases under the retailer's AS option if the marginal production cost is high.

We generalize Baker's result by establishing the optimality of the SVF rule for more general distributions of the processing durations and a more general objective function.

In this study, we illustrate how rigorous methodologies can be developed to derive effective cost allocations to facilitate sustainable collaborations in not for profit operations by modeling the cost allocation problem arising from an economic lot\u2010sizing (ELS) setting as a cooperative game. Specifically, we consider the economic lot\u2010sizing (ELS) game with general concave ordering cost. In this cooperative game, multiple retailers form a coalition by placing joint orders to a single supplier in order to reduce ordering cost. When both the inventory holding cost and backlogging cost are linear functions, it can be shown that the core of this game is non\u2010empty. The main contribution of this study is to show that a core allocation can be computed in polynomial time under the assumption that all retailers have the same cost parameters. Our approach is based on linear programming (LP) duality. More specifically, we study an integer programming formulation for the ELS problem and show that its LP relaxation admits zero integrality gap, which makes it possible to analyze the ELS game by using LP duality. We show that there exists an optimal dual solution that defines an allocation in the core. An interesting feature of our approach is that it is not necessarily true that every optimal dual solution defines a core allocation. This is in contrast to the duality approach for other known cooperative games in the literature.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12542","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['sustainable', 'collaborations', 'cost allocation']","The article discusses sustainable collaborations and effective cost allocation in not-for-profit operations, which hints at some awareness of social responsibility.

However, it is generally the case that cross\u2010trained employees are not as productive on a specific task as employees who were originally trained for that task. Also, the productivity of the cross\u2010trained workers depends on when they are cross\u2010trained. In this work, we consider a two\u2010stage model to analyze the effects of variations in productivity levels on cross\u2010training policies. We define a new metric called achievable capacity and show that it plays a key role in determining the structure of the problem. If cross\u2010training can be done in a consistent manner, the achievable capacity is not affected when the training is done, which implies that the cross\u2010training decisions are independent of the opportunity cost of lost demand and are based on a trade\u2010off between cross\u2010training costs at different times. When the productivities of workers trained at different times differ, there is a three\u2010way trade\u2010off between cross\u2010training costs at different times and the opportunity cost of lost demand due to lost achievable capacity. We analyze the effects of variability and show that if the productivity levels of workers trained at different times are consistent, the decision maker is inclined to defer the cross\u2010training decisions as the variability of demand or productivity levels increases. However, when the productivities of workers trained at different times differ, an increase in the variability may make investing more in cross\u2010training earlier more preferable.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12543","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cross-training in operations management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper studies a dynamic procurement planning problem in which the firm can replenish inventory from a fast and a slow supplier, both with uncertain capacities. The optimal policy is characterized by two reorder points, one for each supplier. Whenever the pre\u2010order inventory level is below the reorder point, a replenishment order is issued to the corresponding supplier. Interestingly, the reorder point for the slow supplier can be higher than that of the fast even if the former has a higher cost, lower reliability, and smaller capacity than the latter, suggesting the possibility of ordering exclusively from an inferior slow supplier in the short term. Moreover, the firm may allocate a larger portion of the long\u2010term total order quantity to the slow supplier than to the fast, even if the former does not possess any cost or reliability advantage over the latter. Such phenomena, different from the observations made in previous studies, happen when the demand is uncertain and the supply is limited or unreliable.

To answer these questions, this research studies the relationship between SSTL of warehouse managers and not only occupational accidents, but also quality and productivity. Moreover, it investigates the managers who are most likely to display SSTL. Data from 87 warehouse managers and 1233 employees were used to test the conceptual model. The results suggest that the dispositional prevention focus of the manager (one of two possible motivational strategies that people deploy) positively relates to SSTL, and that SSTL negatively relates to occupational accidents. Furthermore, SSTL and its identified negative relationship with occupational accidents does not appear to have detrimental impact on productivity or quality. These results extend existing models of SSTL and safety, and can help companies to reduce the number of accidents and the associated costs by selecting and developing safety\u2010specific transformational leaders.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12546","research article","POM","Operations Management","4","['safety', 'leadership', 'occupational accidents', 'well-being']","The article discusses the importance of safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL) in reducing occupational accidents, which reflects a concern for employee well-being and safety.

When only sorted cores are acquired, we find that, (i) it is optimal to acquire cores in multiple grades to balance acquisition and remanufacturing costs; (ii) if reactive acquisition is possible, it reduces the assortment size (number of grades in which cores are acquired) and the total inventory acquired in the planned acquisition; and (iii) the optimal portfolio of grades to acquire and the optimal acquisition and remanufacturing quantities of these grades can be determined analytically. When bulk cores are acquired in addition to sorted cores, the property of reduction in assortment size of the planned acquisition is preserved. We also show that the 3PR should acquire only a fraction of the demand in planned acquisition, and leave the rest for reactive acquisition. This fraction changes during the lifecycle of a remanufactured product. Using a combination of empirical and realistic data from a smartphone remanufacturer we show that sequential acquisition increases expected profit by up to 8% and 27% over only planned and only reactive acquisitions respectively, and reduces the inventory acquired by up to 21% over only planned acquisition.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12554","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['remanufacturing', 'raw material acquisition', 'inventory']","The article focuses primarily on operational strategies for remanufacturing and inventory management, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem of a profit maximizing service firm that dynamically allocates its resources toward acquiring new clients and retaining unsatisfied existing ones. The interaction between acquisition and retention in our model is reflected in the cash constraint on total expected spending on acquisition and retention in each period. We formulate this problem as a dynamic program in which the firm makes decisions in both acquisition and retention after observing the current size of its customer base and receiving information about customers in danger of attrition, and we characterize the structure of the optimal acquisition and retention strategy. We show that when the firm's customer base size is relatively low, the firm should spend heavily on acquisition and try to retain every unhappy customer. However, as its customer base grows, the firm should gradually shift its emphasis from acquisition to retention, and it should also aim to strike a balance between acquisition and retention while spending its available resources. Finally, when the customer base is large enough, it may be optimal for the firm to begin spending less in both acquisition and retention. We also extend our analysis to situations where acquisition or retention success rate, as a function of resources allocation, is uncertain and show that the optimal acquisition and retention policy can be surprisingly complex. However, we develop an effective heuristic for that case.

I describe several ways that scholars can convey relevant research insights into practitioners, including presenting at practitioner conferences, writing for practitioners in traditional crossover journals and in shorter pieces like op\u2010eds and blogs, and attracting the interest of those who write columns, blogs, and articles about research for practitioners. I conclude by describing a few ways that academic institutions can encourage more relevant research, focusing on journals, professional societies, and doctoral programs.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12558","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['relevance', 'practitioners', 'managerial']","The article focuses on enhancing the practical relevance of research for managers and policymakers, which indicates a concern for applicability rather than social justice or equity themes.

Currently, organizational culture research in OM is largely confined to narrow topical and methodological niches and culture is most frequently used as an explanatory variable in quantitative, survey\u2010based research. We argue that the relegation of culture to this niche is due to self\u2010imposed methodological blinders that hobble the OM field. We then present four research imperatives to reinvigorate organizational culture research within our field. We urge OM scholars to view culture as a dynamic concept that can be influenced, to adopt alternative methods, to use non\u2010traditional data sources, and to rethink assumptions about dependent variables. We also identify gaps in the current knowledge and new research questions for the OM domain. We conclude that the field of OM could greatly expand its understanding of organizational culture and in so doing greatly improve business practice, but that to do so will require a change in the culture of the operations management research community.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12562","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['organizational culture', 'dynamic concept', 'research imperatives']","The article discusses the need to change the approach to organizational culture in Operations Management, emphasizing a more dynamic view and the importance of understanding cultural influences.

To balance the setup and inventory related costs, the production manager adopts a two\u2010critical\u2010number control policy, where the production starts when the number of waiting customers reaches a certain level and shuts down when a certain quantity of inventory has accumulated. Once the production is set up, the unit production time follows an exponential distribution. Potential customers arrive according to a Poisson process. Customers are strategic, i.e., they make decisions on whether to stay for the product or to leave without purchase based on their utility values, which depend on the production manager's control decisions. We formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game between the production manager and the customers, where the former is the game leader. We first derive the equilibrium customer purchasing strategy and system performance. We then formulate the expected cost rate function for the production system and present a search algorithm for obtaining the optimal values of the two control variables.

The OEMs outsource their production to a common contract manufacturer, who in turn needs an input from a component supplier. Each OEM may either directly procure the input from the component supplier, or delegate the procurement task to the contract manufacturer. We first analyze the OEMs' procurement game under a non\u2010strategic supplier whose component price is exogenously given. It is found that symmetric equilibria arise for most situations, that is, both OEMs either control or delegate their component procurement in equilibrium. Interestingly, despite the commonly\u2010held belief that the contract manufacturer would be worse off as OEMs gain component procurement control, we show that the contract manufacturer may enjoy a higher profit. Then we study the OEMs' procurement game under a strategic supplier who can set its component price. We find that the supplier's strategic pricing behavior plays a critical role in the equilibrium procurement structure. In particular, in the equilibrium under strategic supplier, the larger OEM always uses delegation while the smaller OEM may use either delegation or control. By identifying the driving forces behind the OEMs' procurement choices, this research helps explain observed industry practices and offer useful guidelines for firms' component sourcing decisions.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12566","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain procurement strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This study examines the relative efficacy of partners' characteristics (i.e., compatibility and resource complementarity) and partners' relationship management capability on collaborative relationships, incorporating mutual trust and reciprocal commitment as two mediator constructs. We use Partial Least Squares to examine the proposed hypotheses using a sample of 191 respondents. Data are collected through a web\u2010survey of international humanitarian non\u2010governmental organizations (NGOs) in countries across Africa, Asia, and South America. The results reveal that (i) resource complementarity and relationship management capability are significant factors influencing collaborative performance through their effects on partners' mutual trust and reciprocal commitment, and that (ii) partners' compatibility (i.e., missions, values, and operational methods) does not significantly drive success or failure of collaboration between international NGOs. These results suggest that given the present diversity of HOs' characteristics, the success of collaboration is associated with the partners' level of understanding of each other's objectives, operations, and values, and to the extent to which organizations efficiently communicate and coordinate their joint activities.

In this study, we model a firm that can finance its inventory (ordered or manufactured) with loans in order to meet random demand which in general may not be time stationary. The firm earns interest on its cash on hand and pays interest on its debt. The objective is to maximize the expected value of the firm's capital at the end of a finite planning horizon. The firm's state at the beginning of each period is characterized by the inventory level and the capital level measured in units of the product, whose sum represents the \u201cnet worth\u201d of the firm. Our study shows that the optimal ordering policy is characterized by a pair of threshold parameters as follows. (i) If the net worth is less than the lower threshold, then the firm employs a base stock order up to the lower threshold. (ii) If the net worth is between the two thresholds, then the firm orders exactly as many units as it can afford, without borrowing. (iii) If the net worth is above the upper threshold, then the firm employs a base stock order up to the upper threshold. Further, upper and lower bounds for the threshold values are developed using two simple\u2010to\u2010compute myopic ordering policies which yield lower bounds for the value function. We also derive an upper bound for the value function by considering a sell\u2010back policy. Subsequently, it is shown that policies of similar structure are optimal when the loan and deposit interest rates are piecewise linear functions, when there is a maximal loan limit and when unsatisfied demand is backordered.

Thereby, they leave no doubt that the POM domain spans the entire supply chain from shovels in the mine and seeds in the ground to recycled waste that is remanufactured and sold as new (as well as refurbished) products. RSST declare that sustainability of the ecosystem cycle must be achieved (even in the face of disaster conditions) by all institutions. RSST believe that practitioners can be taught the necessary attitudes and skills by business and engineering schools. It is noteworthy that the ecosystem cycle they describe is accompanied by marketing and financial decision cycles running parallel from inception of ideas to the \u201cend of life\u201d closure that starts a new cycle for closed\u2010loop product planning. For these coexisting, interdependent, all\u2010encompassing systems, the RSST team leaves no doubt about the evolution of teaching and research opportunities for young POM scholars. These authors focus on the fact that everything that is not morphing is likely to become counterproductive in the not too far future. This is a critical point of view which is based on the fact that the status quo is highly vulnerable. Also, very special is the RSST warning that changes are required in the status quo which must be made without damaging the existing fabric.

When, instead, managers can move across firms, firm-level coinsurance is no longer feasible, but managers may self-insure by switching employer to delay the revelation of their true quality.

Surprisingly, investors attend most to market risk (beta) when evaluating funds and treat returns attributable to size, value, momentum, and industry factors as alpha. Using proxies for investor sophistication (wealth, distribution channels, and periods of high investor sentiment), we find that more sophisticated investors use more sophisticated benchmarks when evaluating fund performance.Received August 14, 2015; accepted May 3, 2016 by Editor Stefan Nagel.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/29/10/2600/2223415","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund performance and investor behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This reduces short interest, bid-ask spreads, and the informativeness of prices. After specific disclosures, short-run abnormal returns are insignificantly negative, but 90-day cumulative abnormal returns are a statistically significant \u22125.23%. We find disclosures are likely to be followed by other disclosures, especially when the initial discloser is large or centrally located. However, there is no subsequent increase in short interest, and prices do not subsequently reverse. These results indicate that large short sellers are well informed, and that disclosures are not being used to coordinate manipulative attacks.Received June 30, 2014; accepted June 24, 2016 by Editor Itay Goldstein.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/29/12/3278/2528299","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of short position disclosures in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The average difference in cash holdings does not increase after 2008, and it is driven by highly R&D-intensive U.S. firms. Because there are almost no similarly R&D-intensive foreign firms, mean comparisons involving these U.S. firms are not reliable.

The funds flowing to and from these activities come from investment, dividends, or net cash. The model fits a broad set of data moments in large heterogeneous samples and across industries. Our parameter estimates imply that misvaluation induces larger changes in financial policies than investment. The investment responses are strongest for small firms but nonetheless modest.

Adjusting for the resulting selection bias reduces average annual index returns from 8.7% to 6.3%, lowers Sharpe ratios from 0.27 to 0.11, and materially impacts portfolio allocations.

Our method yields superior forecasts of beta that have important practical implications. First, unlike standard rolling window betas, hybrid betas carry a significant price of risk in the cross-section even after controlling for characteristics. Second, the hybrid approach offers statistically and economically significant out-of-sample benefits for investors who use factor models to construct optimal portfolios. We show that the hybrid estimator outperforms existing estimators because shrinkage toward a fundamentals-based prior is effective in reducing measurement noise in extreme beta estimates.Received May 17, 2011; accepted October 7, 2015 by Editor Geert Bekaert.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/29/4/1072/1896835","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical approach to estimating beta in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find support for this hypothesis using trust-preferred securities issuance, a form of regulatory arbitrage available to almost all U.S. banks from 1996 to Dodd-Frank. We also find support for predictions that constrained banks are riskier, perform worse during the crisis, and use multiple forms of regulatory arbitrage.

This paper uses a recently developed estimator of matching games, i.e., the maximum score estimator, to advance strategic management research on partner selection in strategic alliances, with a focus on the formation of research alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we develop a matching framework to study strategic alliances, taking a market perspective that explicitly incorporates key features of alliance formation: two-sided decision making; quest for complementarities between indivisible and heterogeneous partner attributes; and competition on each side of the market for partners on the other side of the market. Second, we assess the relative performance of the maximum score and standard discrete choice estimators by performing simulations based on known functional relationships in various matching scenarios. Third, within the context of biopharmaceutical research alliances, we hypothesize and find support using the maximum score estimator for complementarity in partner size and in upstream research capabilities.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2448","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of partner selection and strategic alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We demonstrate the power of these methods through a study of Meiji Era Japanese cotton spinning industry from its state-supported founding through its development into a sustained, globally competitive presence. We shed light on the role of superior human and organizational capabilities of industry leaders. In particular, we demonstrate that these helped the industry leaders to overcome deep, systematic structural factors to make a few firms highly productive and able to move the entire industry into high growth and to respond to and thrive in dynamic environments on the world stage.

Answering this question requires addressing how customers develop their interpretations and evaluation criteria of the new technology. This interpretive process occurs through discussions with other market participants. Firms can influence customers' interpretations through the use of language and visual images\u2014what we call \u201cdiscursive strategies.\u201d Firms can fail to navigate technological disruptions because their discursive strategies do not communicate effectively with customers. Yet, methodological limitations have restricted the study of discursive strategies.

Networks form as the result of actor attributes as well as through the influence of existing ties. Conventional regression models require assumptions of independence between observations, and fail to incorporate endogenous structural effects of the observed network. ERGMs represent a methodological innovation for network formation research given their ability to model actor attributes along with endogenous structural processes. We illustrate these advantages by modeling board interlock formation among Fortune 100 firms. We also demonstrate how ERGMs offer significant opportunities to extend existing strategy research and open new pathways in multiparty alliances, microfoundations of interorganizational network formation, and multiplexity of ties among actors.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2454","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on methodological advancements in strategic management research without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A large-sample statistical analysis","This article advances strategic management by developing a data-driven simulation method to analyze how the characteristics of a group influence the characteristics of the group's components. We apply our method to the underrepresentation of women in the top management of S&P 1,500 firms. Although extant research suggests that the presence of women in top management could be self-reinforcing, we theorize and provide strong evidence that women face an implicit quota, whereby a firm's leadership makes an effort to have a small number of women in top management, but makes less effort to have, or even resists having, larger numbers of women. In consequence, the presence of a woman on a top management team reduces the likelihood that another woman occupies a position on that team.

We consider how relatively novice technology firms can learn intraorganizational collaborative routines from more experienced alliance partners and then deploy them independently for their own innovative pursuits. We examine the alliance relationships between Eli Lilly & Co. (Lilly), a recognized expert in collaborative innovation, and 55 small biotech partner firms. Using three levels of analysis (firm, patent, and inventor dyad), we find that greater social interaction between the partner firm and Lilly subsequently increases internal collaboration among the partner firm's inventors.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2424","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['collaboration', 'alliances', 'innovation']","The article discusses collaboration and alliances, which are important for knowledge sharing and innovation, but it does not explicitly address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Qualifying this empirical support, it was found that items regarding manufacturing operations and facilities seemed to measure aspects unrelated to the focal competences, and that marketing competence had no relation to future market-resource accumulation.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2428","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical research and theoretical refinement related to competences in manufacturing firms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Whereas past studies have treated misconduct monolithically, we examine failures of integrity and competence separately. Using a policy capturing methodology that isolates investors' decision making from potential confounds, we find that, following an integrity failure, investors perceive outside and interim successors positively but inside successors negatively. Following a competence failure, investors perceive outside successors positively but are ambivalent toward inside and interim successors. Our findings indicate that whether an act of misconduct was an integrity failure or a competence failure, and what type of successor the firm chooses, are important considerations when using CEO succession as a means to restore investor confidence.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2430","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['integrity', 'competence', 'misconduct']","The article discusses integrity and competence failures in leadership succession, which touches on ethical considerations in management.

We formally model how contracts trade off productive and destructive uses of knowledge in a buyer-supplier relationship. We show that, when the buyer's pre-existing resources are vulnerable to the revelation of sensitive knowledge, the supplier overinvests in knowledge acquisition as it expects to use the knowledge as a threat in price negotiations. A non-renegotiable closed-price contract prevents such overinvestment and reduces the supplier's ability to expropriate the buyer ex post. Our results extend to the cases of renegotiable closed-price contracts, repeated interactions between a buyer and a supplier, and the use of nondisclosure policies. We draw theoretical, empirical, and managerial implications from our model.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2432","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of knowledge acquisition and contract management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These deals are found to improve the alignment of spinoff firm managers' incentive compensation with stock market performance, especially among spinoff firm managers that used to be divisional managers of the spun-off subsidiary, and particularly when the spun-off subsidiary performs better than or is unrelated to its parent firm's remaining businesses. By contrast, incentive alignment does not improve for the parent firm managers running the divesting companies. This finding appears to be driven by a significant post-spinoff increase in these managers' incentive compensation, the magnitude of which is inversely related to governance quality in their firms. Together, these results elucidate how spinoffs influence managerial compensation in diversified firms and the companies they divest.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2434","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the technical aspects of managerial compensation and corporate spinoffs without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2016","37","10","Peran van Reeven,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Peran van Reeven\n                     \n                        vanreeven@ese.eur.nl\n                     \n                     Department of Applied Economics, Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsCorrespondence to: Peran van Reeven, P.O.

Multimarket contact increases the frequency of contact between firms, and this anticipated future interaction promotes cooperation. In network industries, especially small firms may want to cooperate in order to increase the attractiveness of the composite product. By using size as a moderating variable, we indeed find a consistent positive effect of multimarket contact on product quality for small airlines. We show that this effect can be attributed to network coordination and that this effect generally dominates the negative mutual forbearance effect in a recent period.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2435","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical relationship between multimarket contact and service quality in the airline industry, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2016","37","10","Bryan W.

Political affinity is defined as the similarity of national interests in global affairs. We argue that political affinity affects how foreign acquirers anticipate their bargaining position in their negotiations with domestic target firms. With decreasing political affinity, the host government becomes increasingly likely to intervene against foreign firms in an acquisition deal. Consequently, foreign acquirers need to provide a more lucrative initial offer to dissuade target firms from leveraging government intervention to oppose the acquisition. Our prediction is supported by strong evidence that political affinity, as revealed by UN general assembly voting patterns, leads to lower initial acquisition premiums.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2438","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['political affinity', 'economic nationalism', 'government intervention']","The article discusses the concept of political affinity and its impact on cross-border acquisitions, which touches on themes of governance and economic nationalism.

We address this question by combining insights from competitive rivalry, strategic groups, and nonmarket strategy literatures in an emerging economy context. Specifically, we theorize how threats from informal and foreign rival firms in an emerging market influence a firm's engagement in corruption activities and its investments in HR training, respectively. We also argue that the likelihoods of such focal firm actions against competitor group threats differ, contingent on the focal firm's market and resource profiles.

We discover that the authors misinterpreted the regression coefficients for hypothesis testing and only two of their four hypotheses were actually tested. For these two hypotheses, one is not supported in either their study or ours, while the other is supported in their study but not ours. For the remaining two hypotheses we find support for one of them, which is concerned with the curvilinear effect of product diversity on the mode of expansion. In sum, the original study claims that all four hypotheses are supported, whereas only one is supported in the replication. More specifically, the former results, including the effects of the independent and control variables, are largely not generalizable to the latter.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2569","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of international expansion and replication of previous research without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, the concepts and measures of relational, structural, and positional embeddedness (per Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999), as well as interdependence, are foundational for many studies. We explore these determinants of alliance formation by replicating the baseline analyses of Ahuja, Polidoro, and Mitchell's, 2009 SMJ article. We examine the impact of empirical choices with respect to time period, underlying data generating model, and industry by isolating each effect in turn. We demonstrate that while geographic similarity and product-market similarity each robustly predict the interdependence effect, the effects of both technological similarity as well as the embeddedness predictors are sensitive to context and/or method.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2570","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of strategic alliance formation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation.

Firms choose to globally diversify based on their firm attributes, some of which may be unobservable. Given these exogenous firm attributes, the decision to diversify globally is endogenous and self-selected. Our study offers a replication of an earlier study. Using the same specifications save for the Heckman selection instrument, our results contradict past research that did not address endogeneity. We posit that the global premium should reflect the value of multinational operating flexibility. We use the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis as creating exogenous variation to permit a test for the positive change in firm valuation due to global diversification. During the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, the premium associated with global diversification became larger and more significant than before the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis. The churn of subsidiaries entering and exiting countries increased during the crisis, pointing to the value of an operating flexibility to restructure the geography of the multinational network. In all, the results contradict past findings and provide evidence that operating flexibility is more valued during times of high volatility, thus generating the diversification premium.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2574","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of global diversification and firm value without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In particular, takeover threats may lead to managers' reluctance to adopt a strategy toward firm-specific knowledge accumulation because implementing this strategy requires them to acquire specialized skills, which are at risk under takeover threats. Conversely, takeover protection leads to an increase in firm-specific knowledge. Further, the relationship between takeover protection and firm-specific knowledge is positively moderated by managerial ownership, which helps align managerial interests with those of shareholders. But the relationship is negatively moderated by managerial tenure, as long-tenured managers have already committed to their firms. Using a differences-in-differences method with Delaware antitakeover rulings in the mid-1990s as an exogenous shock, we found results supporting these arguments.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2443","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on takeover protection and knowledge accumulation strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

CEO stock options and temporal orientation in the presence of slack","Research summary: We draw on behavioral agency theory to explain how decision heuristics associated with CEO stock options interact with firm slack to shape the CEO's preference for short- or long-term strategies (temporal orientation). Our findings suggest CEO current option wealth substitutes for the influence of slack resources in encouraging a long-term orientation, while prospective option wealth enhances the positive effect of slack on temporal orientation.

Despite the importance of these issues, there is scant analysis concerning their interaction. Using a comprehensive database of the construction industry, we show that vertical integration positively influences the centralization decision and that the main mechanism driving this relationship is an improvement in the hierarchically coordinated adaptation of firm activities when complexity and uncertainty are high. We also observe that centralization is negatively related to the extent of relational contracts between principals and agents, and positively related to an exogenous increase in the cost of employee layoffs. Our results suggest that managers cannot consider firm boundaries and internal organization to be independent decisions.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2446","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic management issues related to internal delegation and vertical integration without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

While extant work does not usually distinguish among activist types or their variety of tactics, we show that different activists (e.g., social movement organizations vs. religious groups and activist investors) rely on dissimilar tactics (e.g., boycotts and protests versus lawsuits and proxy votes). Further, we show how protests and boycotts drag companies \u201cthrough the mud\u201d with media attention, whereas lawsuits and proxy votes receive relatively little media attention yet may foster investor risk perceptions.

Linking distance, isomorphism, and performance","Research summary: Research demonstrates that foreign firms from institutionally distant countries imitate the practices of domestic firms (i.e., adopt an isomorphism strategy). The conjecture has been that pursuing such a strategy can help foreign firms counteract the deleterious performance consequences associated with institutional distance; yet there is scant evidence of such. This study treats isomorphism as an endogenously selected strategy influenced by institutional distance to examine its performance consequences. Using a dataset of 80 foreign banks from 25 countries operating in the United States, we find that foreign firms from institutionally distant home countries benefit initially from selecting an isomorphism strategy. However, the benefits diminish with experience.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2462","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of isomorphism and performance related to foreign firms, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Founders' prior shared experience and performance of newly founded banks","Research summary: Pre-entry industry experience is a central construct in the founding team literature. Research on prior shared experience (PSE) emphasizes that founding teams face challenges integrating and acting on independent experiences, so PSE should be beneficial for new venture performance. Existing studies, however, typically study PSE in blunt terms, expecting that more is better. Instrumental variable analyses of a unique sample of 344 commercial banks founded in four U.S. states between 1996 and 2006 showed that industry-specific PSE may be more or less beneficial, depending on several founding team characteristics. Our findings provide nuance and caution to the narrative that PSE is always beneficial. Under some circumstances, firms with founding team PSE may be no better off than those without founding team PSE, suggesting more research is necessary to understand when and why founding team experience matters to new firms.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2467","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['experience', 'founding teams', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of founding team experience and its impact on performance, lacking significant engagement with social justice or DEI themes.

We examine two kinds of problem/project-behaviors: Individuals can set up projects around the formulation of new problems or join existing projects and define and/or work on subproblems within an existing problem. The choice between these two behaviors is influenced by the mode of communication. A communication mode with little a priori structure is the best mode for communicating about new problems (i.e., formulating a problem); empirically, it is associated with project launching behaviors. In contrast, more structured communication fits subproblems better and is related to project joining behaviors.

A large-scale investigation of the social context of ownership","Research summary: Using a large sample of private firms across Europe, we examine how the social context of owners affects firm strategy and performance. Drawing on embeddedness theory and the institutional logics perspective, we argue that embeddedness in a family, in particular the nuclear family, can strengthen identification and commitment to the firm, but can also induce owners to behave more conservatively. Consistent with this argument, we find that family-owned firms have higher profit margins, returns on assets, and survival rates compared to single-owner or unrelated-owners' firms, but also invest and grow more slowly, hold greater reserves of cash, and rely less on external debt. These differences are most pronounced when the two largest shareholders are married.

Importantly, though, we find that, on average, firms undertake more internal than external CSR actions, and we theorize that a wider gap between external and internal actions is negatively associated with market value. We confirm our hypotheses empirically, using the market-value equation and a sample comprising 1,492 firms in 33 countries from 2002 to 2008.

The study also finds that the premiums tend to be even larger when celebrity CEOs have more recently attained celebrity status.

The role of outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity","Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2471","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","7","['diversity', 'board', 'CEO', 'experience', 'turnover']","The article emphasizes the importance of board diversity in the context of CEO successions, indicating a focus on DEI themes within organizational management.

In view of these differences, we explore the drivers of sample selection bias and review how Heckman models alleviate it. We demonstrate three important findings for scholars seeking to use Heckman models: First, the independent variable of interest must be a significant predictor in the first stage of a model for sample selection bias to exist. Second, the significance of lambda alone does not indicate sample selection bias. Finally, Heckman models account for sample-induced endogeneity, but are not effective when other sources of endogeneity are present.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2475","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of sample selection bias and statistical models without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Mental models can be underspecified, missing interdependencies, or overspecified, containing nonexistent interdependencies. Using a simulation model, we find that under- and overspecification have opposite effects on exploration, and thereby, performance. The effects are also opposite, depending on whether a manager controls all choice variables. The mechanism underlying our results is a feedback loop: misspecified mental models influence managerial learning about the effectiveness of choices; this learning guides how the environment is explored, which in turn, affects which information will be generated for future learning. We explore implications of these results for strategic management and introduce the notion of \u201ccognitive fit\u201d between the mental model of the decision-maker and the strategic environment.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2479","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive fit and managerial decision-making without addressing any themes related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice.

The two opposing predictions about the behavior of CEOs upon retirement suggest that retiring CEOs' decisions about certain long-term investment items may be more complex than suggested in the literature. In search of an answer to this question, we examine the relationship between CEO retirement and the level of firm commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The results show that CEO retirement has a negative effect on firm commitment to CSR. However, we found that the negative effect becomes weaker when CEOs retire at relatively older ages or are retained on the board of directors of their own firms. Our finding suggests that CEOs who face weaker pressure from the labor market for corporate directors may pay more attention to preserving their legacy.

Using hand-collected data on a sample of over 30,000 firm-year observations, we find that family firms are less likely than non-family firms to undertake divestitures, especially when these companies are managed by family rather than non-family-CEOs. However, we then establish that the divestitures undertaken by family firms, predominantly those run by family-CEOs, are associated with higher post-divestiture performance than their non-family counterparts. These findings indicate that family firms may fail to fully exploit available economic opportunities, potentially because they pursue multiple objectives beyond the maximization of shareholder value. These results also elucidate how the characteristics of corporate owners and managers can influence the value that firms derive from their corporate strategies.

As a corollary, most prior literature has suggested that firms should experience survival benefits from growth. In this paper, we argue that survival benefits need to be balanced against the potential cost of rapid growth, and they are contingent upon the structure of the environment. We predict a curvilinear relationship between an entrant's growth rate and failure, and argue that the relationship is contingent upon the local agglomeration of economic activity and the local structure of competition. We test and find support for our predictions using firm-level longitudinal data of all de novo entrants into the Canadian manufacturing sector between 1984 and 1998.

Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered.

How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures\u2014corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns.

Although this literature has described important features of this market, how it influences the rate and direction of innovation remains an open question.

We then present evidence of a dramatic decline in the rate of innovation for these firms.

We also theorize that, depending on the outcome in question, the effects of charisma can become both amplified and diminished as CEO tenure advances.

However, while capability development is widely studied, capability erosion has not been integrated into our understanding of performance heterogeneity. To understand erosion, we study two software development organizations that experienced diverging capability trajectories despite similar organizational and technological settings. Building a simulation-based theory, we identify the adaptation trap, a mechanism through which managerial learning can lead to capability erosion: well-intentioned efforts by managers to search locally for the optimal workload balance lead them to systematically overload their organization and, thereby, cause capabilities to erode.

When firms experience actions with negative outcomes, they change in response. Any persistence with such actions is said to be suboptimal, attributable to factors such as threat rigidities. This paper theorizes that persistence may sometimes be rational, attributable to the characteristics of feedback. It uses a novel dataset of medical devices to show how organizations learn to search for future novel or incremental innovations based on failure. It finds that firms change innovation activities when novel innovations fail, but persist when incremental innovations fail. These findings support the hypothesis that inferences based on failure from incremental innovations tend to be more robust, leading firms to be more willing to persist when failure occurs.

We explore this question by presenting a framework that considers both the focal competing technologies as well as the ecosystems in which they are embedded. Within our framework, each episode of technology transition is characterized by the ecosystem emergence challenge that confronts the new technology and the ecosystem extension opportunity that is available to the old technology. We identify four qualitatively distinct regimes with clear predictions for the pace of substitution. Evidence from 10 episodes of technology transitions in the semiconductor lithography equipment industry from 1972 to 2009 offers strong support for our framework. We discuss the implication of our approach for firm strategy.

Drawing from the spatial geography and acquisition strategy literatures, we argue that successful completion of acquisitions can be partially explained by their spatial characteristics. We start by predicting that geographic distance has a particularly strong impact in reducing the likelihood of completing related acquisitions; we then identify contingencies based on multiple forms of direct, contextual, and vicarious experience that can help acquirers overcome the constraints of distance.

Grounded on a complexity science paradigm, this article challenges our understanding of the role of agency in strategic timing while adding conceptual and methodological innovations. Based on micro and macro approaches, qualitative interpretations, and econometric studies, the results tend to show that while agency partly produces strategy dynamics and timing of actions, strategic evolution (when not random) is largely emergent and driven by its past. These findings move the understanding of strategic evolution and timing away from a strategic choice perspective and toward a complex combination of agency, causal determinism, and self-organization.

We find that calculative trust and relational trust positively influence supplier performance, with calculative trust having a stronger association than relational trust. Yet, important boundary conditions exist. If buyers invest in supplier-specific assets or when supply side market uncertainty is high, relational trust, not calculative trust, is more strongly associated with supplier performance. In contrast, when behavioral uncertainty is high, calculative trust, not relational trust, relates more strongly to supplier performance. These results highlight the value of examining distinct forms of trust.

Using data from S&P 1,500 firms, we find that board committee overlap associated with linking pin directors (i.e., those serving simultaneously on the audit and compensation committees) is an important conduit for knowledge transfer between boards' monitoring and incentive alignment functions. These directors are associated with lower executive compensation and influence pay mix. In studying the dynamics behind this process, we find that newly created linking pins improve monitoring effectiveness whereas recently dissolved linking pins decrease it.

Applying an institutional perspective, this research aims to provide a clearer picture by comparing the adaptation and network configurations of existing vs. new entrepreneurial cohorts during China's institutional change after 1992. The qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the existing cohort of entrepreneurs displays network inertia, in that they largely maintain strong tie-based political and market networks; the new cohort instead demonstrates better adaptation by establishing fewer political networks but more weak and diverse market networks. This comparative research unpacks the institutional mechanisms underlying such differences, and serves as a ground for future investigations dealing with the strategic actions of different entrepreneurial cohorts that are largely neglected in previous studies.

Comparing biotech ventures backed by corporate and independent VCs","Entrepreneurial ventures are a key source of innovation. Nowadays, ventures are backed by a wide array of investors whose complementary asset profiles differ significantly. We therefore assert that entrepreneurial ventures can no longer be studied as a homogeneous group. Rather, we harness the inherent dichotomy in the profiles of independent VCs and corporate investors to study ventures' innovation outcomes. Our sample consists of 545 U.S. biotechnology ventures founded between 1990 and 2003 and backed by independent venture capitalists (VCs) or corporate VCs (CVC). We find CVCs' investees exhibit higher rates of innovation output, compared to independent VC-backed peers. Moreover, the performance of CVC-backed ventures is sensitive to their ability to leverage corporate assets, underscoring the role of CVC accessibility and FDA approval requirements as the mechanisms associated with CVC contribution.

The role of poor innovative performance and financial slack","This paper examines the adjustments firms make to the composition of their portfolios of technology-sourcing vehicles (i.e., alliance, acquisition, or go-it-alone) in response to poor innovative performance. We advance a behavioral perspective on the make/buy/ally question, suggesting that differences in financial slack will generate different portfolio decisions. Specifically, we posit that firms with greater levels of financial slack are more likely to respond to poor innovative performance by opting for (1) greater vehicle diversification, and (2) new sourcing vehicles, while firms with less financial slack will respond by (1) downscoping their portfolio of sourcing vehicles, and (2) reverting to more familiar vehicles. We find support for our predictions using extensive data from the population of U.S. public pharmaceutical firms from 1992 to 2006.

At the firm level, we show that the profitability of a customer-specific synergy depends upon cross-market correlation of customer preferences, differs when the synergy is cost-based versus differentiation-based, and can even be negative when the synergy is kept proprietary to a single firm. We also show that returns to imitating such a synergy may decline as it strengthens. At the industry level, we find that exploiting customer-specific synergies causes endogenous market convergence at a point that depends upon whether the synergy is cost-based or differentiation-based and whether it is imitated.

Considering its behavioral consequences, we argue that such knowledge transfer often may destabilize existing power structures in foreign acquired firms prompting conflict and power struggles, and as a result negatively affects their performance. We find support for this adverse knowledge transfer effect. Only at very high levels of N-LSKT, when acquirers are likely to extend their own capabilities and associated power structures more completely, do the performance effects improve. Further, predeal success of acquirers and post-deal functional integration amplify, while acquirers' strategic control over the acquired firm alleviates the generally negative effects of N-LSKT.

We argue that engaging simultaneously in buying and selling knowledge should allow firms to increase innovation outcomes. At the same time, we identify some of the relevant costs (cognitive, transaction, and organizational costs) that \u201copen\u201d firms can reduce by combining knowledge inflows and outflows. Empirically, however, we find no evidence for such complementarity in a sample of Belgian manufacturing firms. Firms buying and selling knowledge do increase their sales of new products, but at the same time their R&D costs increase more than proportionally. Our findings, therefore, indicate the need for research into a better understanding of the drivers of actual costs of organizing for open innovation.

Based on panel data (from 1995 to 2000) from 258 firms in 23 industries, we found that executive temporal depth exhibited different patterns of relationships with competitive aggressiveness in low- and high-velocity industries.

Previous research on entrepreneurial failure has focused on two kinds of explanations: statistical and psychological. Statistical explanations attribute excess entry to random errors made by boundedly rational entrepreneurs attempting to estimate business opportunities in risky markets. Psychological explanations focus on entrepreneurial overconfidence and competition neglect. These explanations emerged independently and have not been tested or compared in the same study. In this experimental study, we distinguish entrepreneurial markets from other types of markets and test statistical and psychological hypotheses for all market types. We find that excess entry is significantly greater in small, risky markets than in other market types, and that confidence levels account for excess entry, over and above the effects of unbiased statistical errors.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2378","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on statistical and psychological explanations for entrepreneurial failure without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find that individuals rely on their social relationships to enable entrepreneurial activities that have the potential to create a reasonable income gain. In a sample of 1,049 households in rural Kenya, we test whether the disintegration of social structure attenuates entrepreneurial behavior. When coupled with factors such as income loss, gender of the household head, and access to communal resources, social structure plays a pivotal role in entrepreneurial action. We propose that the search for reasonable income gain is a key driver of entrepreneurial action at subsistence levels, thereby adding to behavioral explanations of entrepreneurship.

Through qualitative and quantitative data, we reveal how individual technology-entry decisions are influenced by a portfolio-level timing preference, and how this preference informs other aspects of innovation strategy, too. Early movers address greater, more uncertain revenue opportunities with broader, less selective innovation portfolios. Conversely, late movers target lower, more certain revenue opportunities with narrower, more selective portfolios. While timing per se seems unrelated to performance, a timing-strategy alignment is. Future research on the equifinal configurations we propose\u2014broad/nonselective for early movers and narrow/selective for late movers\u2014could thus help resolve the debate about the link between timing and performance.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2385","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of innovation strategy and decision-making in the mobile handset industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2016","37","6","Edward B.

In technology-driven firms, there has been an explicit emphasis on appropriability through imitation deterrence and cumulative inventions that build on prior firm innovation. We introduce systematic empirical evidence for a third mechanism of appropriability namely, knowledge retrieval, which is defined as the re-absorption of previously spilled knowledge. We extend previous studies which consider technological complexity and organizational coupling as predictors of appropriability by examining their impact on knowledge retrieval. We find that technological complexity has a curvilinear relationship with retrieval while organizational coupling has a negative relationship.

Through resource dependence theory, we develop the concept of ecological uncertainty and explain its effects on firms' access to and management of natural resources. We then predict that firms adapt to ecological uncertainty with natural-resource-intensive practices, as well as practices that attempt to mitigate its underlying causes. Using institutional theory, we also predict that environmental expectations moderate these responses. Our results indicate that firms did manage ecological uncertainty by adopting natural-resource-intensive practices, but not mitigation practices. They also show that stronger environmental expectations constrained firms from adopting natural-resource-intensive practices and promoted their adoption of mitigation practices in response to ecological uncertainty.

The predictions from this model are tested in the Chinese brewing industry (1998\u20132007), with results showing that acquirers strongly prefer inferior targets in existing geographic markets, but are relatively more likely to choose superior targets in new markets, especially if they have strong acquisition capabilities.

Our empirical analyses with a large sample of Japanese firms between 1997 and 2007 show that when managers have elite education, high pay inequality with ordinary employees, and when firms experience poor sales growth, foreign ownership is more likely associated with the adoption of stock option pay.

We develop a formal agency model in which headquarters offers equity and profit incentives to business-unit managers with the objective of maximizing total expected firm returns. The resulting compensation contract provides a rich mechanism for aggregating value from collaborative interactions across business units, aligning managers' efforts with the firm's growth prospects and organization structure and managing the dual risks in profits and firm market value. The inclusion of equity incentives elicits higher levels of own-unit and collaborative efforts over the profits-only contract. Our results suggest that equity-based incentives are most beneficial when profitability is uncertain relative to long-term growth prospects, in firms pursuing related diversification strategies, and in periods of rising equity markets.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2392","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['equity', 'collaboration', 'incentives']","The article discusses equity-based incentives and collaboration, which touch on themes of fairness and organizational practices.

Accordingly, we hypothesize a positive association between public disclosures and voluntary executive turnover. An analysis of pharmaceutical and communications equipment firms from 1990 to 2004 supports this prediction, underscoring the need to understand better the effects of voluntary public disclosures on a firm's ability to protect its human capital.

We predict that if substituting labor with capital is difficult, the group advantage of flexibly changing labor would be stronger in countries with high levels of financial development.

The gains resulting from these shifts are expected to be more pronounced when a firm undertakes a legacy (rather than a non-legacy) spinoff, which removes the business that may be constraining analysts' coverage decisions in the first place. Consistent with this argument, firms that undertake legacy spinoffs experience greater improvements in the composition and quality of their analyst coverage than their non-legacy counterparts, and in their overall forecast accuracy and stock market performance. Taken together, these findings shed light on the relationships among the scope decisions, analyst coverage, and valuations of diversified firms.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2397","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of corporate spinoffs and analyst coverage without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We derive predictions from both a pure capabilities view and the AMC framework, and test those predictions in the U.S. auto leasing market, in which the leasing subsidiaries of car manufacturers directly compete with the same independent lessors who provide complements to the manufacturers.

By reviewing 110 articles published in SMJ from 1980 to 2012, we identify several critical issues in theorizing and testing of these relationships for which current practice falls short. These include insufficient causal argumentation, incorrect testing, mixing up two different types of moderation, and not realizing that the curve can flip completely.

We posit that this negative effort is greater when firms have high levels of unrelated diversification because there is less operational interdependency, so tournament effects are stronger. We also contend that the influence of tournament incentives on behavior leading to lawsuits is weaker when environmental uncertainty is high.

We propose an additional interpretation of this relationship in the context of discrete corporate development activities. We argue that firms choose to repeat successful activities, thereby accumulating high experience with them. Data on 437 aircraft projects introduced through three governance modes show that the positive performance effect of the firm's experience with the focal mode becomes insignificant after accounting for experience endogeneity. We suggest that in a general case, experience with corporate development activities may be tinged with both learning and selection effects.

Specifically, we propose a multifaceted perspective on exploitation by theoretically and empirically distinguishing between repetitive exploitation versus incremental exploitation. We argue that repetitive exploitation can impede exploration and delay firms' responses to environmental changes, while incremental exploitation can impel exploration and accelerate firms' responses to environmental changes. We test our arguments using extensive longitudinal data from the hard disk drive (HDD) industry, and our supportive empirical findings highlight the relevance of our distinction between the two types of exploitation and their very different effects on exploration.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2402","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['exploitation', 'exploration', 'environmental changes']","The article discusses the concepts of exploitation and exploration in a business context, which touches on ethical implications but does not primarily focus on social justice or equity themes.

Yet, the existing research has given little consideration to the strategies of foreign entrepreneurs beyond their decisions to start a firm. In this article, we address this gap by examining how foreign entrepreneurs may bring value to their firms as firm managers. We argue that foreign owner-managers may benefit their firms by having access to home-country resources. We demonstrate that, compared to hired local managers, foreign owner-managers reduce firms' operating costs by disproportionately hiring home-country labor when this labor is more cost-efficient. This effect is larger for labor-intensive industries and for entrepreneurs from less wealthy countries.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2403","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['foreign entrepreneurs', 'value creation', 'home-country resources']","The article discusses foreign entrepreneurs and their contributions to firms, which touches on themes of diversity and inclusion in the context of management.

We reconcile institutional theory with the resource-based view and industrial organization economics to investigate the effects of economic adversity, such as the 2008 global economic crisis. Using a three-level random coefficient model, we examine 15,008 firms across 10 emerging and 10 developed countries for the 2005\u20132011 period. We find that firm effects become stronger under adversity, whereas industry effects become weaker, as well as country main and interaction effects, particularly among the emerging economies. These findings confirm our assumptions that the firm's own fate is, to a great extent, self-determined; a reality that is even more pronounced during periods of extreme economic hardship.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2422","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on profitability and economic effects without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that the overemphasis on this relationship has resulted in controversy and confusion in the literature, where the role of social networks remains largely unaddressed. By developing computational models of network effects with various network structures, we show that social distance in a customer network plays a moderating role that strengthens or weakens the relationship between the installed base and network effects, which in turn, affects the durability of incumbency advantage. When the average social distance between members in a customer network is large, the incumbency advantage will not be amplified, and an entrant with an incompatible product or service may find ways into the market. On the other hand, when the average social distance is small, early entry with a growing installed base will magnify incumbency advantage.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2405","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['network effects', 'incumbency advantage', 'social networks']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of network structures and their impact on incumbency advantage, with minimal engagement in social justice or ethical considerations.

On the one hand, bankrupt firms tend to send positive signals through restructuring to decouple themselves from the stigma of bankruptcy. On the other hand, the preexistence of the bankruptcy stigma may reduce the signaling effectiveness of firms' restructuring efforts, making the outcome prediction difficult. We address this dilemma by developing a dynamic integrative view to extend signaling theory, arguing that subsequent signals from key external stakeholders can effectively help evaluate bankrupt firms' quality and reduce the ambiguity in interpreting firms' restructuring signals. Using a sample of U.S. public bankrupt firms under Chapter 11 reorganization, we find evidence supporting the argument.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2406","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of signaling theory related to bankrupt firms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Implications for managers, investors and strategy researchers","Research summary: Raters of firms play an important role in assessing domains ranging from sustainability to corporate governance to best places to work. Managers, investors, and scholars increasingly rely on these ratings to make strategic decisions, invest trillions of dollars in capital, and study corporate social responsibility (CSR), guided by the implicit assumption that the ratings are valid. We document the surprising lack of agreement across social ratings from six well-established raters. These differences remain even when we adjust for explicit differences in the definition of CSR held by different raters, implying the ratings have low validity.

We suggest that social capital deriving from stable task relationships between organizational members has a direct positive effect on organizational performance. Said effect depends, in both strength and functional form, on whether actors involved in stable dyads are located at the core or at the periphery of the organization. We also argue that core and peripheral social capital affect performance indirectly by moderating the organization's ability to leverage its human capital to improve performance. Results from a 48-year study of the National Basketball Association support our arguments and bear important implications for strategic human resource practices and organizational performance in competitive settings.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2409","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['social capital', 'organizational performance', 'human capital']","The article discusses social capital and its effects on organizational performance, which touches on themes of relationships and human resources.

In this article, we argue that the social and the environmental practices (SEPs) associated with business sustainability not only contribute to short-term outcomes, but also to organizational resilience, which we define as the firm's ability to sense and correct maladaptive tendencies and cope positively with unexpected situations. Because organizational resilience is a latent, path-dependent construct, we assess it through the long-term outcomes, including improved financial volatility, sales growth, and survival rates. We tested these hypotheses with data from 121 U.S.-based matched-pairs (242 individual firms) over a 15-year period. We also tested, but did not find support for, the relationship between SEPs and short-term financial performance.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2410","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['sustainable', 'social', 'environmental', 'organizational resilience']","The article emphasizes sustainable business practices and their social and environmental implications, which aligns with socially progressive themes.

While prior research establishes that organizations become rigid to change as they age, it underemphasizes measures that they may take to renew their adaptive potential. I address this gap by investigating whether hiring stimulates change to the knowledge organizations possess. Learning by hiring, I argue, helps organizations to evolve their knowledge as they age by disrupting routine, introducing distant knowledge, and facilitating socialization. I test the effectiveness of these mechanisms using 38\u2009years (1970\u20132007) of data from the U.S. biotechnology industry, and find that hiring stimulates more change as organizations age, enabling them to renew their knowledge and counter the effects of obsolescence.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2411","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['hiring', 'organizational knowledge', 'change']","The article discusses the role of hiring in organizational change and knowledge evolution, which touches on themes of workforce dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It focuses on IBM's transition from market leadership in a failed path (plasma) to leadership in the emerging dominant technology (LCD) in the 1980s. Interviews and internal documents offer two primary factors explaining renewal at IBM. First, IBM Research had a hybrid structure that captured the benefits of both centralized and decentralized R&D. Second, middle managers shaped senior management cognitive frames to focus on business-related issues instead of specific technical issues, thus bypassing biases often resulting from failure. The study offers an integrated framework on what facilitates flexibility at the technology, organization, and decision-making levels.

Different governance modes and the mediating role of innovation","Research summary: In this article, we address the role of R&D offshoring strategies in the sales growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We propose that different governance modes of R&D offshoring\u2014insourcing versus outsourcing\u2014may lead to growth, but that they differ in their effects. In turn, we argue that innovation mediates the relation between international R&D sourcing strategies and sales growth. Based on a large database of SME manufacturing enterprises in Spain, we find that offshore outsourcing positively affects sales growth both directly and indirectly, while offshore insourcing only affects sales growth indirectly via innovation results. The analysis reveals different contributions of each governance mode to sales growth and the mediating role of innovation in the relation between R&D offshoring and firm growth.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2413","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['offshoring', 'innovation', 'SME growth']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of R&D offshoring and its impact on sales growth, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We formulate a computational model in which an organization's strategy adapts based on performance feedback. However, the distinctive feature of our approach is that we abandon the \u201corganization as a unitary actor\u201d assumption, and model a separation of beliefs and actions. The central insight is that, given this separation, precise implementation has benefits beyond the well-known effect of enabling exploitation of good strategies.

However, little research exists on the question of why one firm is chosen over another. We develop a model relating characteristics of similarity and complementarity between acquirers' and target firms' key resources, including their  products and R&D pipelines, to the likelihood of the acquirers  choosing a particular firm. We construct measures of similarity and complementarity between and across products and R&D pipelines, and test their effects using a novel application of the choice model. Findings reveal that acquirers view similarity and complementarity differently, based on the resource they are comparing. When making comparisons to their own R&D pipelines, acquirers prefer similarity over complementarity whereas when making comparisons to their product portfolios, they prefer complementarity over similarity.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2416","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate acquisition strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We argue and show that when the host location has a weak IPR, fewer host inventors are involved in host R&D projects when compared to home R&D projects.

Yet, transitioning between these orthogonal types of R&D is considered profound organizational change. Building on recent research showing that compact, significant changes in R&D expenditure is an antecedent to the transition between explorative and exploitative R&D, I show that this leap between exploration and exploitation is quite hazardous. The magnitude of changes in R&D expenditure, whether increases or decreases, is positively associated with organizational failure. Firms maintaining higher levels of absorptive capacity are more capable of surviving the leap from R&D-based exploitation to exploration, and firms that do not use reductions in R&D expenditure to manipulate short-term earnings performance are more likely to survive the leap from exploration to exploitation.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2423","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['sustainable', 'organizational change', 'R&D']","The article discusses organizational change and sustainable competitive advantage, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

How job anxiety affects top executive decision making in gain and loss contexts","Research summary: Despite abundant anecdotal evidence that many top executives experience anxiety in their jobs, the upper echelons literature has remained largely silent on the organizational implications of executive job anxiety. In this study, we theorize that job anxiety will cause executives to (1) create a social buffer against threats by surrounding themselves with supportive decision-making teams, and (2) pursue lower-risk firm strategies. We further argue that these effects will vary depending upon whether strategic decisions occur in gain versus loss contexts. We test our ideas using a novel multisource, multimethod approach that includes data from 84 top executives of large organizations, their decision-making teams, their friends and families, and archival sources. Results from an analysis of 154 major strategic decisions provide general support for our theory.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2425","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['job anxiety', 'decision making', 'supportive teams']","The article discusses job anxiety among executives and its impact on decision-making, which touches on organizational behavior and team dynamics but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

We find that, following internal framing contests, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) led efforts to change their sector's architecture, starting from both strong and weak competitive positions and working with suppliers to advocate a new vision based on modularity and outsourcing. As the risks and costs of this vision became apparent, OEMs were able to reverse course and reaffirm their hierarchical control on the sector, taking advantage of structural features that weren't salient ex ante. We consider why certain OEMs initiated this status-quo challenging change, and identify how sector structure mediated their (and suppliers') efforts to implement it. We document the complex change process, driven by agency, structure, and heterogeneity in firms' understanding of their sector's architecture.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2426","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on structural changes and competitive dynamics within the automotive sector without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance.

I offer two contrasting perspectives: (1) alliance partner reconfiguration leads to disruption, hence increases the risk of subsequent project termination; (2) partner reconfiguration leads to adaptation, hence decreases this risk. Data on 1,025 interfirm Australian mining alliances (2002\u20132011) shows that on average alliance partner reconfiguration increases the risk of project termination. For firm exit from an alliance, the effect is contingent on a firm's resource base, but not for firm entry. Surprisingly, I do not find that alliance partner reconfiguration is beneficial in a dynamic environment. I discuss the implications of these findings for the literature on strategic alliance dynamics and that on strategic alliance outcomes.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2429","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of strategic alliances and project termination without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our contribution is to explore four mechanisms. By adopting a reverse causality approach (Gelman and Imbens, 2013), we find evidence consistent with one of them: short-term oriented firms prefer to bribe rather than invest in fixed assets, while the opposite is true for firms with a long-term orientation. We rule out that bribe payments drain financial resources for investment, that firms that invest do not bribe because fixed assets make them less flexible and more vulnerable to future bribes, and that less efficient firms bribe rather than invest.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2431","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['bribery', 'investment', 'firm-level']","The article focuses primarily on the economic implications of bribery in investment decisions without addressing broader social justice themes or ethical critiques.

Our analysis reveals how TiVo navigated coopetitive tensions by continually adjusting its strategy, its technology platform, and its relational positioning within the evolving U.S. television industry ecosystem. We theorize how (1) disruption may affect not just specific incumbents, but also the entire ecosystem; (2) coopetition is not just dyadic, but also multilateral and intertemporal, and (3) strategy is both a deliberative and emergent process involving continual adjustments, as the disruptor attempts to balance coopetitive tensions over time.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2442","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on disruptive innovation and strategic management without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs.

This effect is more pronounced when existing analyst forecasts are optimistic and when firms had selective disclosure policies pre-FD. We also find that the increased use of MFs as downward guidance leads to post-FD reductions in MF quality (accuracy and informativeness) for the downward guiding MFs that are most likely meet/beat motivated, while quality improves for upward-guiding MFs. Finally, our evidence suggests that results from prior research about FD-induced changes in information environment variables, such as analyst forecast quality and investor trading activities, depend on whether the firm issues MFs and whether those MFs are downward guiding.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/119/3745/Asymmetric-Effects-of-Regulation-FD-on-Management","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of Regulation Fair Disclosure and its impact on management earnings forecasts without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on Pay Performance Sensitivities (PPS) and use dispersion in PPS across top executives as a proxy for the incentive design component shaped by an executive team's synergy profile. We model optimal PPS dispersion and use residuals from this model to measure deviations from optimal. We find that firm performance is increasing (decreasing) in the residual when PPS dispersion is too low (too high). We conjecture that deviations from optimal are sustained by adjustment costs, finding that firms only close around 60 percent of the gap between target and actual PPS dispersion over the subsequent year. Viewing a team's equity grants as a vector, we provide evidence that firms use subsequent equity grants to actively manage PPS dispersion toward optimality. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the deleterious effect of deviations from optimal is decreasing in the duration of a team's tenure together, and increasing in the importance of effort coordination across team members for firm performance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/21/3807/Management-Team-Incentive-Dispersion-and-Firm","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of incentive design and firm performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Adherence to Predetermined Scripts during Earnings Conference Calls","This paper examines whether market participants infer negative information about future unexpected firm performance when managers adhere to predetermined scripts when responding to questions during earnings conference calls. I argue that managers respond to questions from prepared scripts to avoid the disclosure of bad news. Using a measure of the adherence to predetermined language, I provide evidence that a lack of spontaneity is negatively associated with the market reaction to the call and with the abnormal returns in the subsequent quarter. I further find that analysts downgrade their forecasts following these calls. I also provide evidence that adherence to predetermined language is negatively associated with future unexpected firm accounting performance, supporting investors' negative response to it. Finally, I find that bid-ask spreads increase and firms are less likely to guide future earnings when managers adhere to the predetermined language of a script, suggesting that firms provide less information, not more, during these calls.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/229/3799/Can-Investors-Detect-Managers-Lack-of-Spontaneity","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and market reactions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

First, the adverse effect of financial misstatements documented by Beatty et al. (2013) is not limited to high-profile scandals and can be generalized to a larger population. Second, the distortions are not confined to capital investments; they also extend to choices peer firms make with respect to R&D, advertising, and pricing policies\u2014decisions with immediate bottom-line impact. Third, I document that the magnitude of the distortion varies predictably with peer firms' characteristics, the misstating firms' external information environment, and the industry-specific information environment within which the misstatement occurs. Specifically, I find smaller distortions for larger peers and peers managed by more able managers, and larger distortions for more widely followed misstating firms and in the industries in which more firms misstate. Collectively, my results suggest that the distortive effect of financial misstatements is larger and more pervasive than documented in prior research.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/251/3785/Do-False-Financial-Statements-Distort-Peer-Firms","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of financial misreporting and its impact on peer firms' decisions, without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Using a field experiment in a retail services company, I test whether these incentives, which appeal to diverse motivation mechanisms\u2014tangible payoffs, self-regulation, and social esteem\u2014and, hence, have different utilities, are complements or substitutes. The results of the hard performance data collected, in the form of a ratio of sales relative to goals, show that monetary incentives and recognition are substitutes, while feedback is independent of the other incentives. The negative interaction between monetary incentives and recognition is evidence of crowding out between tangible payoffs and social esteem motivations. Individually, these two incentives have a positive impact on performance of about 13 percentage points, which corresponds to a 32.5 percent performance increase. Feedback interactions and main effects are not statistically significant, which suggests that, in this setting, providing feedback in the form of knowledge of results has no impact.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/279/3731/Monetary-Incentives-Feedback-and-Recognition","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['diverse', 'recognition', 'feedback']","The article discusses the role of recognition and feedback as motivators, which hints at an awareness of diverse motivational mechanisms.

We consider a principal/multi-agent model where the principal either contracts with all parties directly or delegates part of the contracting authority to one of the agents. Delegated contracts improve risk sharing and generate implicit incentives for the agent entrusted with contracting authority. However, delegated contracts also entail a loss of control in motivating lower-level agents. In addition, when performance is aggregated, delegated contracts render agents' incentives more interdependent and create spillovers up and down the hierarchy. We demonstrate that accounting practices that aggregate the performance of multiple agents can complement organizational forms characterized by greater decentralization. In contrast, accounting practices that capture agents' performance contributions separately favor more centralized organizational forms. Our findings suggest that in settings where performance measurement systems are more aggregate, decentralization is more prevalent.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/1/99/3831/Performance-Aggregation-and-Decentralized","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and organizational forms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we assess whether SEC action via the issuance of fair value comment letters to registrants is followed by reductions in uncertainty about the firms' fair value estimates. We hypothesize that registrants that receive a comment letter focusing on their fair value disclosure policies experience reductions in investor uncertainty regarding their fair value estimates in the post-letter period, compared to the pre-letter period. Supporting this prediction, we find that for the periods after the fair value comment letters, the associations between Level 2 and 3 fair value assets and our measures of uncertainty are significantly reduced. These findings are robust to a series of tests designed to ensure that we do not simply capture general changes in market uncertainty levels for firms investing in these types of assets. Our study contributes to the further understanding of market participants' perception of fair value disclosures by investigating the role of SEC enforcement. This finding is important given recent criticisms of fair value reporting emanating from the highest levels of government and industry.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/2/349/3757/The-Impact-of-SEC-Disclosure-Monitoring-on-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['SEC', 'fair value', 'disclosure', 'uncertainty']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of SEC monitoring and fair value disclosures without addressing social justice or ethical critiques of business practices.

In addition, we find evidence that internal control opinion shopping occurs primarily in competitive audit markets.

In particular, a placebo based on lagged share price mimics time-series and cross-sectional variation observed for the revised measures. More generally, we find biases in the asymmetric timeliness specification because earnings, accruals, and other measures of performance are often related to second and higher moments of the distribution of returns. In addition to suggesting that the asymmetric timeliness specification be used with caution, our study illustrates the useful role placebos can play in archival studies.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/2/625/3853/Placebo-Tests-of-Conditional-Conservatism","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial reporting conservatism and bias in measures without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We provide evidence that proxies for each of these types of insider information are positively associated with insider trading. Specifically, we find that net insider sales in the 2001Q2\u20132007Q2 pre-financial crisis quarters predict not-yet-reported non-performing securitized loans and securitization income for those quarters, and that net insider sales during 2006Q4 predict write-downs of securitization-related assets during the 2007Q3\u20132008Q4 crisis period. We find that net insider sales are more negatively associated with banks' subsequent stock returns in their securitization quarters than in other quarters.

Using hand-collected data on association membership, we find that association member firms conduct higher-quality audits than nonmember firms, where audit quality is proxied for by fewer Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection deficiencies and fewer financial statement misstatements, as well as less extreme absolute discretionary accruals and lower positive discretionary accruals. We also find that audit fees are higher for clients of member firms than for clients of nonmember firms, suggesting that clients are willing to pay an audit fee premium to engage association member audit firms. Finally, we find that member firm audits are of similar quality to a size-matched sample of Big 4 audits, but member firm clients pay lower fee premiums than do Big 4 clients. Our inferences are robust to the use of company size-matched control samples, audit firm size-matched control samples, propensity score matching, two-stage least squares regression, and to analyses that consider changes in association membership. Our findings should be of interest to regulators because they suggest that association membership assists small audit firms in overcoming barriers to auditing larger audit clients. In addition, our findings should be informative to audit committees when making auditor selection decisions, and to investors and accounting researchers interested in the relation between audit firm type and audit quality.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/3/767/3829/Small-Audit-Firm-Membership-in-Associations","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['membership', 'audit quality', 'associations']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of audit quality and fees related to membership in associations, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Reasons for these overruns include cost understatements in initial project proposals and escalation of commitment to projects when initial actual costs turn out to be higher than expected. Prior literature has suggested, and some firms have implemented, a device that limits escalation and thus potentially reduces cost overruns: changing decision makers (superiors) so that the manager who approves continuation of a project is not the same individual who approved the project initially. We provide theoretical explanations and experimental evidence about how changing versus continuing superiors affect the underestimates of cost in initial project proposals. We find that although changing superiors, as expected, are more likely than are continuing superiors to react skeptically to continuation proposals when first-period cost overruns have occurred, this does not reduce initial cost understatements and overruns. On the contrary, in our setting it leads to greater initial understatements and overruns. Subordinates anticipate that new superiors will be more critical of their projects; hence, they discount later-period payoffs and focus on gaining initial funding by providing understated cost estimates.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/3/793/3816/Cost-Estimates-Cost-Overruns-and-Project","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management and cost estimation without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In doing so, we show that firm-specific estimates of differential persistence are particularly useful when forecasting earnings for more stable firms (e.g., more profitable, lower growth, and less levered firms).

Drawing upon finance theory that recognizes banks' superior information access and processing abilities, this study predicts and finds that banks adjust loan contract terms in response to the ongoing misreporting. Compared with loans issued in the prior period, loans issued in the misreporting period have higher interest spread, are more likely to be secured by collateral, and have more restrictive covenants. Further analyses show that banks acquire indirect, rather than direct, information about the misreporting and that they do not fully adjust loan pricing until after the restatement announcement. Together, these findings suggest that banks make timely, but insufficient, adjustments during the misreporting period. Nevertheless, banks' early reactions appear to be unique, as equity investors do not respond to the ongoing misreporting, but react to the loan information when it becomes public.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/3/835/3836/Banks-Acquisition-of-Private-Information-about","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial misreporting and banks' responses without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Our results indicate that among profitable firms, firm-years with the largest increases in firm-specific constraints are associated with declines in firms' cash effective tax rates ranging from 3.00 to 5.14 percent, which equate to between 2.87 and 4.82 percent of operating cash flows.

Consequently, mandating range disclosures should have the greatest effect on managers most in need of reining in\u2014and is unlikely to reveal aggressive reporting to investors (as might be expected) because these managers reduce aggressiveness in anticipation of investor actions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/3/973/3792/The-Interaction-of-Communicating-Measurement","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['ethics', 'reporting', 'disclosure']","The article discusses ethical implications of reporting practices and the influence of personality traits on managerial decisions, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects of reporting rather than broader social justice or equity themes."],["2016","91","4","Fran\u00e7ois Brochet; \n\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Fran\u00e7ois Brochet\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Boston University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n                            \n            Patricia Naranjo; \n\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Patricia Naranjo\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Rice University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n                                Gwen Yu\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Gwen Yu\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Harvard University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar","The Capital Market Consequences of Language Barriers in the Conference Calls of Non-U.S. Firms","We examine how language barriers affect the capital market reaction to information disclosures.

For non-U.S. firms that hire an English-speaking manager, we find less use of non-plain English and fewer erroneous expressions. Calls with a greater use of non-plain English and more erroneous expressions show lower intraday price movement and trading volume.

The results are robust to alternative measures of internal governance and to various approaches used to address potential endogeneity, including a difference-in-differences approach. In cross-sectional analyses, we find that the effect of internal governance is stronger for firms with more complex operations where key subordinate executives' contribution is higher, is enhanced when CEOs are less powerful, is weaker when the capital markets benefit of meeting or beating earnings benchmarks is higher, and is stronger in the post-SOX period.

Importantly, the effects of such evaluation outcomes can extend beyond the employee(s) directly affected, because such outcomes can be observed by other employees within the firm. The net effect of such vicarious learning as an indirect control depends on the inferences employees make after observing a peer's evaluation outcome. In this study, we use an experiment to investigate whether the inferences observer-employees make about how managers evaluate and reward employee behavior depend on whether the valence of the observed outcome is positive or negative. Using the setting of a strategic performance measurement system, we test and find support for a causal model, in which the valence of the observed outcome influences observer-employees' inferences and subsequent behavioral focus via their psychological distance from, and their construal of, the observed outcome. Our results suggest that how observer-employees respond after observing a peer employee's evaluation outcome is asymmetric. Specifically, when contemplating their own behavior, employees who observe positive outcomes focus on the performance measures within the strategic performance measurement system, whereas those who observe negative outcomes focus on the underlying strategic construct.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/4/1087/3849/Vicarious-Learning-under-Implicit-Contracts","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['employee contracts', 'managerial discretion', 'evaluation outcomes']","The article discusses employee evaluation and managerial discretion, which touches on aspects of fairness in workplace practices.

By requiring all firms to follow the same recognition and measurement process, the FASB intended FIN 48 to improve the relevance of income tax accounting. However, practitioners argue that reserves reported under FIN 48 lack relevance because they represent liabilities that will never be paid to tax authorities. Consistent with these concerns, we estimate that over a three-year period, only 24 cents of every dollar of reserves unwind via settlements. Moreover, contrary to the FASB's intention, we find no evidence that FIN 48 increased the ability of tax expense to predict future tax cash flows. Rather, we find that the predictive ability of tax expense for future tax cash flows decreases among firms for which FIN 48 is most restrictive. Finally, we find no evidence that investors identify firms for which reserves overstate future tax cash outflows and incorporate this into their valuations. Our results provide evidence that the uniform accounting rules of FIN 48 negatively affect the relevance of income tax accounting.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/4/1195/3827/One-Size-Does-Not-Fit-All-How-the-Uniform-Rules-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting rules without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I define a reversal as occurring when a firm cuts discretionary investments to a below-expected level in one period and reverts back to at least the expected level of investment during the next period. Unlike accrual earnings management, REM involves deliberately altering the operations of the firm to influence reported accounting numbers. To the extent that such interventions diverge from optimality, they can expose the firm to real economic costs. I find that a reversal of an abnormal cut in discretionary investments in the year after the cut has taken place is indicative of REM. I further find that, on average, reversing cuts are associated with lower future operating performance, but that such results vary significantly depending on the various incentives to engage in REM, as well as other factors that affect its associated costs and benefits. These findings are of interest to investors, regulators, and academics with respect to the identification and consequences of REM.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/4/1219/3864/Real-Earnings-Management-and-Long-Term-Operating","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and its impact on performance without addressing any social justice, ethical, or DEI themes.

Specifically, I examine the effect of IFRS adoption on the likelihood and direction of auditor switching in a sample of firms from five European Union countries: the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Poland during the period from 1998 through 2010. I hypothesize that IFRS adoption creates an expert advantage for global audit firms (i.e., Big 4 audit firms, Grant Thornton, and BDO) during a regime shift in reporting standards. I find that clients are more likely to switch from small to global audit firms in the year of IFRS adoption. I also hypothesize that the strength of a country's regulatory regime affects the likelihood of auditor replacement around IFRS adoption. I find that firms listed in countries with high-quality regulation and enforcement are significantly more likely to switch from small to global audit firms in the year of IFRS adoption (with the odds of the switch almost doubled when compared to non-adoption years). In weaker regulatory regimes, IFRS adoption is not associated with an increase in auditor switching. Additional tests provide evidence that global audit firms' advantage stems from their perceived IFRS expertise. Finally, the results confirm that not only Big 4, but also Grant Thornton and BDO, benefit from IFRS adoption.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/4/1257/3782/The-Big-Consequences-of-IFRS-How-and-When-Does-the","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of IFRS adoption and its impact on audit markets without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We appeal to cognitive psychology literature on motivated reasoning and propose that forecasting difficulty interacts with such incentives to yield the observed walkdown. Higher forecasting difficulty generates a wider range of outcomes from which analysts can justify optimistically biased forecasts. In regression analyses, we find that the interaction between analysts' incentives for optimism and difficulty exhibits the strongest effect on earnings walkdowns. We also examine revenue forecasts as a benchmark of lower forecasting difficulty and find that revenue walkdowns are relatively diminutive. However, when analysts forecast losses, revenue forecasts are more critical and exhibit markedly steeper walkdowns. Our results suggest that analyst forecast walkdowns are better characterized by an interactive effect between analysts' strategic incentives for optimism and forecasting difficulty.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/4/995/3811/The-Interactive-Role-of-Difficulty-and-Incentives","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings forecasts and analysts' incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Next, we ask how the information revealed through CDS trading influences the output of equity and credit rating analysts. We find that post-CDS trading, the dispersion and error of earnings per share forecasts are generally reduced, and downgrades by both types of analysts become more frequent and more timely before large negative earnings surprises, suggesting that the CDS market conveys information valuable to financial analysts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/5/1315/3771/Credit-Derivatives-and-Analyst-Behavior","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit derivatives and their impact on analyst behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2016","91","5","Kelsey Brasel; \n\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Kelsey Brasel\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Ball State University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n                            \n            Marcus M.

In contrast, this study provides theory and experimental evidence that CAM disclosures, under certain conditions, reduce auditor liability judgments as jurors perceive that undetected fraudulent misstatements were more foreseeable to the plaintiff (i.e., the financial statement user suing the auditor). However, we find that CAM disclosures only reduce auditor liability for undetected misstatements that, absent CAM disclosure, are relatively difficult to foresee. Finally, CAM disclosures that are unrelated to subsequent misstatements neither increase nor reduce auditor liability judgments relative to the current regime (i.e., where CAMs are not disclosed), but reduce liability judgments relative to reporting that there were no CAMs. As such, we find that, relative to stating there were no CAMs, disclosure of any CAM (i.e., related or unrelated) provides litigation protection in cases of undetected fraud. Consequently, the CAM requirement could incentivize auditors to disclose innocuous boilerplate CAMs, thereby diluting the impact of more warranted CAM disclosures.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/5/1345/3764/Risk-Disclosure-Preceding-Negative-Outcomes-The","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['disclosure', 'liability', 'auditor']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of audit practices and liability judgments without significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

These results indicate that the use of the RM process is associated with poor financial reporting quality only in firms from China, where legal enforcement and investor protection are weak. In addition, we find that compared with Chinese ADR firms, Chinese RM firms have weaker bonding incentives (as measured by CEO turnover-performance sensitivity) and poorer corporate governance. These factors, in turn, contribute to the lower financial reporting quality of Chinese RM firms.

Tournament Horizon and Dynamic Task Complexity in Multi-Period Settings","When using a tournament in multi-period settings, firms have discretion in selecting the tournament horizon. For example, firms can use a single tournament (a grand tournament) or a sequence of multiple tournaments, each with a shorter horizon than a grand tournament (a repeated tournament). Firms have also begun to use a combination of both in which a repeated tournament is embedded within a grand tournament (a hybrid tournament). Using an experiment, we investigate whether the effect of tournament horizon on performance depends on the dynamic complexity of the task, which reflects the potential for effort in one period to influence the link between effort and performance in future periods. When dynamic task complexity is low, we find that performance is greatest in the hybrid tournament, followed by the repeated and then the grand tournament. In contrast, when dynamic task complexity is high, we find that performance is greatest in the repeated tournament, followed by the grand and hybrid tournaments, with similar performance in the latter two tournaments. More generally, the results of our experiment suggest that the effect of tournament horizon on performance depends on dynamic task complexity. These results can help firms make better decisions when designing their tournaments by reinforcing the need to align the tournament horizon with the task.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/5/1391/3788/A-Marathon-a-Series-of-Sprints-or-Both-Tournament","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on tournament design and performance metrics without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We investigate whether Deloitte's actions to remediate the PCAOB's concerns are associated with changes to their clients' financial reporting for income taxes. We find that Deloitte's clients increased the reported valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and increased the reported reserve for uncertain tax benefits (UTBs) in response to increased auditor scrutiny over income tax accounts. Additionally, we find that in subsequent periods, Deloitte's clients report valuation allowances and UTB balances that are not significantly different than other annually inspected auditors, consistent with Deloitte changing the quality controls related to audits of income tax accounts after the failed remediation of the 2007 Part II report.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/5/1411/3838/Do-Income-Tax-Related-Deficiencies-in-Publicly","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['audit', 'financial reporting', 'quality controls']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of auditing and financial reporting without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques of business practices.

For managers presented with causal linkages with delays, long-term profit generation is higher than the control group, but is not significantly different from the causal linkages without delays treatment. Those managers presented with causal linkages with delays, however, demonstrate learning across the four simulation rounds. In contrast, learning is found to plateau for the causal linkages without delays treatment and is not present for the control group.

We find that auditors are more likely to issue a modified going-concern (GC) report to financially distressed clients from high-liability states than to those from low-liability states. We sharpen inferences using a natural experiment that examines the causal effects of two exogenous shocks to auditor third-party liability standards, which dramatically restricted auditors' liability in New Jersey in 1995 and in California in 1992. Results from difference-in-differences tests imply that auditors' propensity to issue a modified opinion for client firms in New Jersey and California decreases significantly after the decline in auditors' litigation exposure, relative to control firms from other jurisdictions.

Holding a staff member's skeptical judgments and acts constant, superiors on the engagement team evaluate the staff's skeptical behavior based on whether the staff's investigation of an issue ultimately identifies a misstatement. Our evidence suggests that evaluators penalize auditors who employ an appropriate level of skepticism, but do not identify a misstatement. Although consultation with their superiors while exercising skepticism improved staff auditors' performance evaluations, consultation did not effectively mitigate the outcome effect on their evaluations.

The benefits may be reduced if the shifted income must be returned to the U.S. as a dividend in the short term and face the same U.S. tax it would have if the income had not been shifted. Firms, then, have incentive to defer repatriation of earnings and to fund domestic cash needs with external financing. The cost of external financing, however, is increasing in financial constraints, leading to the prediction that constrained firms will be unable to defer repatriation and, therefore, will reap no benefits from shifting. Using a new methodology for measuring income shifting, we find, consistent with predictions, that financially constrained firms shift less income from the U.S. to foreign countries than their unconstrained peers. We estimate that financially constrained firms shift out 20 percent less of pre-shifted income than unconstrained firms. Translating this percentage to dollar values, the mean (median) constrained firm shifts $16 million ($7 million) out of the U.S. each year, while the mean (median) unconstrained firm shifts $321 million ($134 million) out of the U.S. each year. Assuming that the inability to defer repatriation is the primary constraint preventing the U.S. worldwide tax system from being a de facto territorial system, we use our findings to estimate that changing to a pure territorial tax system would increase outbound income shifting by U.S. multinationals by 8 percent.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/6/1601/3783/The-Effect-of-Financial-Constraints-on-Income","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial constraints and income shifting without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

We assert that jurors perceive precise accounting standards to constrain auditors' control over financial reporting outcomes, resulting in a lower propensity for negligence verdicts when the accounting treatment conforms to the precise standard. However, we hypothesize that the use of either imprecise standards or CAMs reduces the extent to which jurors perceive this constraint to exist, leading to increased auditor liability. We present experimental evidence supporting this argument. Our results highlight the similarities between the effects of imprecise accounting standards and CAMs on negligence assessments. These results provide insight for regulators and the auditing profession about the potential consequences of the proposed regulatory changes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/6/1629/3876/The-Effects-of-Critical-Audit-Matter-Paragraphs","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['auditor liability', 'accounting standards', 'negligence']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and auditor liability without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Using three broad measures of tax avoidance\u2014book-tax differences, permanent book-tax differences, and long-run cash effective tax rates\u2014to test our hypothesis, we find that the cost of equity is lower for tax-avoiding firms. This effect is stronger for firms with better outside monitoring, firms that likely realize higher marginal benefits from tax savings, and firms with higher information quality. Overall, our results suggest that equity investors generally require a lower expected rate of return due to the positive cash flow effects of corporate tax avoidance.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/6/1647/3814/The-Effect-of-Corporate-Tax-Avoidance-on-the-Cost","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of corporate tax avoidance and its impact on cost of equity without addressing any social justice, ethical, or DEI themes.

I document that public banks have more elastic labor cost structures than private banks, which suggests that public bank managers prefer greater flexibility to remove labor resources when desired. Consistent with public banks facing greater financial reporting pressures, I find that they reduce labor costs to avoid earnings declines. However, I also find that the use of labor cost reductions to manage required regulatory capital is more pronounced in private banks. Consistent with the explanation that access to the equity markets allows public firms to sell equity in lieu of cutting costs, I find that the use of labor cost reductions to manage capital requirements is concentrated in the subsample of banks with lower equity issuances. These findings suggest that while public ownership induces financial reporting pressure, it may also alleviate regulatory pressure through greater ability to sell equity.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/6/1671/3884/Does-Ownership-Structure-Affect-Labor-Decisions","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of ownership structure and labor cost management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Analyst/investor days are less frequent, but with longer duration and greater price impact than conference presentations. They are mostly hosted by firms that already have opportunities to interact with investors at conferences, but whose complex and diverse activities make the short duration and rigid format of a conference presentation an imperfect solution to these firms' information problems. Analyst/investor days and conference presentations tend to occur in different quarters, consistent with their competing for the time and attention of senior management.

Experiments 1\u20133 provide converging evidence that audit seniors are more willing to speak up to a team-oriented leader and about issues that are aligned with that leader's concerns. Experiment 4 provides evidence that the effect of team-oriented leadership on willingness to speak up is mediated by team members' commitment to the team leader and, to a lesser extent, by their identification with their team, but not by concerns about the immediate or eventual repercussions of speaking up. Together, these studies provide evidence that auditors' willingness to raise audit issues is affected by what the auditor has to say and how they think their message will be received, potentially affecting audit effectiveness and audit efficiency.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/91/6/1781/3833/Team-Oriented-Leadership-and-Auditors-Willingness","articles","TAR","Accounting","4","['team-oriented', 'leadership', 'willingness', 'commitment']","The article discusses team-oriented leadership and its impact on auditors' willingness to raise issues, indicating a focus on ethical organizational practices and team dynamics.
